# Main Title: Biomolecules  

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Biomolecules**  
Content:  
- Biomolecules are chemical compounds found in living organisms, essential for structure and function.  
- They include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, each playing a crucial biological role.  
- Biomolecules can be classified as micromolecules (small molecules) or macromolecules (large complex molecules).

### **Slide 2: Chemical Composition of Living Organisms**  
Content:  
- Living organisms contain elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and trace metals.  
- Biomolecules are composed of simple organic compounds, forming complex structures through polymerization.  
- Water is the most abundant molecule in cells, followed by proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.

### **Slide 3: Carbohydrates – Energy Providers**  
Content:  
- Carbohydrates serve as energy sources and structural components in cells.  
- They are classified as monosaccharides (glucose), disaccharides (sucrose), and polysaccharides (starch, cellulose).  
- Cellulose, a polysaccharide, forms plant cell walls, providing strength and rigidity.

### **Slide 4: Proteins – Structural and Functional Molecules**  
Content:  
- Proteins are composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, forming diverse structures.  
- They perform enzymatic, structural, transport, and defensive functions in living organisms.  
- Hemoglobin transports oxygen, while enzymes like amylase catalyze biochemical reactions.

### **Slide 5: Lipids – Energy Storage and Membrane Components**  
Content:  
- Lipids are hydrophobic molecules that store energy and form biological membranes.  
- They include fats, phospholipids, and steroids, playing roles in insulation and hormone production.  
- Phospholipids are key components of cell membranes, maintaining selective permeability.

### **Slide 6: Nucleic Acids – Genetic Material**  
Content:  
- Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) store and transmit genetic information in all living organisms.  
- DNA consists of nucleotide chains carrying instructions for protein synthesis.  
- RNA plays roles in gene expression, with mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA assisting in protein formation.

### **Slide 7: Enzymes – Biological Catalysts**  
Content:  
- Enzymes speed up chemical reactions by lowering activation energy without being consumed.  
- They exhibit specificity, binding to substrates at active sites to catalyze reactions.  
- Enzyme activity is influenced by temperature, pH, and inhibitors, regulating metabolic pathways.
