# Main Title: Structure of the Atom

---

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Atomic Structure**
Content:
• The diversity in chemical behavior arises from differences in atomic structure.
• Atoms are composed of subatomic particles: electrons, protons, and neutrons.
• The modern atomic model evolved from early philosophical ideas to experimental discoveries.

---

### **Slide 2: Discovery of Subatomic Particles**
Content:
• The discovery of cathode rays led to the identification of electrons as negatively charged particles.
• Goldstein’s canal rays experiment revealed positively charged particles later named protons.
• Chadwick discovered neutrons in 1932 by bombarding beryllium with alpha particles.

---

### **Slide 3: Thomson’s and Rutherford’s Atomic Models**
Content:
• Thomson proposed the "Plum Pudding Model," where electrons were embedded in a positive sphere.
• Rutherford’s gold foil experiment revealed a dense, positively charged nucleus in the atom’s center.
• Rutherford’s model failed to explain electron stability and atomic spectra.

---

### **Slide 4: Bohr’s Model of the Atom**
Content:
• Bohr proposed that electrons move in fixed orbits with quantized energy levels.
• Energy is absorbed or emitted when electrons transition between orbits.
• The model explained hydrogen's spectral lines but failed for multi-electron atoms.

---

### **Slide 5: Wave-Particle Duality of Electrons**
Content:
• Electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, as described by de Broglie.
• Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle states that position and momentum cannot be precisely measured simultaneously.
• Quantum mechanics replaced classical orbits with probabilistic electron clouds.

---

### **Slide 6: Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom**
Content:
• Schrödinger's equation describes electron distribution as wave functions.
• Orbitals are regions with high electron probability, replacing fixed circular orbits.
• Principal, azimuthal, magnetic, and spin quantum numbers define electron states.

---

### **Slide 7: Quantum Numbers and Atomic Orbitals**
Content:
• The principal quantum number (n) determines the size and energy of an orbital.
• The azimuthal quantum number (l) defines the shape (s, p, d, f) of orbitals.
• The magnetic quantum number (m) specifies the orbital’s orientation in space.

---

### **Slide 8: Electronic Configuration and Aufbau Principle**
Content:
• The Aufbau principle states that electrons fill lower energy orbitals first.
• Pauli’s exclusion principle limits each orbital to two electrons with opposite spins.
• Hund’s rule dictates that electrons occupy degenerate orbitals singly before pairing.

---

### **Slide 9: Atomic Spectra and Energy Levels**
Content:
• Atoms absorb and emit energy in discrete quanta, producing line spectra.
• Hydrogen’s emission spectrum follows the Rydberg equation, forming spectral series.
• Bohr’s model explained spectral lines but was later refined by quantum mechanics.

---

### **Slide 10: Summary of Atomic Structure Concepts**
Content:
• Atomic models evolved from indivisible particles to quantum mechanical descriptions.
• Subatomic particles, orbitals, and electron configurations determine chemical properties.
• Quantum mechanics provides the most accurate understanding of atomic behavior.
