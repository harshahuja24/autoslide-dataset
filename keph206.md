# Main Title: Oscillations  

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Oscillations**  
Content:  
- Oscillations are periodic motions where a system moves back and forth about an equilibrium position.  
- They are observed in pendulums, springs, waves, and electrical circuits.  
- Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is the most fundamental type of oscillatory motion.

### **Slide 2: Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)**  
Content:  
- SHM occurs when the restoring force is directly proportional to displacement and directed towards equilibrium.  
- The equation of SHM is given by F = -kx, where k is the force constant.  
- Examples include a mass-spring system and a simple pendulum under small displacements.

### **Slide 3: Differential Equation of SHM**  
Content:  
- The motion of a simple harmonic oscillator is governed by the equation d²x/dt² + (ω²)x = 0.  
- The solution is x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ), where A is amplitude and ω is angular frequency.  
- This describes the position of the oscillator as a function of time.

### **Slide 4: Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion**  
Content:  
- The total mechanical energy in SHM remains constant and is the sum of kinetic and potential energy.  
- Kinetic energy is maximum at equilibrium, while potential energy is maximum at extreme positions.  
- The equation E = (1/2) k A² represents total energy in SHM.

### **Slide 5: Damped Oscillations**  
Content:  
- Damped oscillations occur when energy is lost due to friction or resistance.  
- The amplitude decreases over time, leading to eventual cessation of motion.  
- Examples include shock absorbers in vehicles and seismic damping in buildings.

### **Slide 6: Forced Oscillations and Resonance**  
Content:  
- Forced oscillations occur when an external periodic force drives a system.  
- Resonance happens when the driving frequency matches the system’s natural frequency, leading to large amplitude oscillations.  
- Real-world examples include bridge vibrations and tuning forks in musical instruments.

### **Slide 7: Applications of Oscillations**  
Content:  
- Oscillatory motion is fundamental in timekeeping devices like pendulum clocks and quartz watches.  
- Electrical oscillations form the basis of radio transmissions and alternating current circuits.  
- Seismographs use oscillatory principles to measure and analyze earthquakes.

### **Slide 8: Mathematical Representation and Graphs**  
Content:  
- Displacement, velocity, and acceleration in SHM follow sinusoidal variations with time.  
- Graphs of SHM illustrate periodic motion with phase differences among x, v, and a.  
- Understanding these graphs helps in analyzing mechanical and electrical oscillators.
