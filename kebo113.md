# Main Title: Plant Growth and Development  

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Plant Growth**  
Content:  
- Growth in plants is an irreversible increase in size, volume, or cell number over time.  
- It occurs due to metabolic processes and is influenced by both internal and external factors.  
- Plants exhibit continuous growth due to the presence of meristems at specific locations.  

---  

### **Slide 2: Phases of Plant Growth**  
Content:  
- Growth consists of three phases: meristematic, elongation, and maturation phases.  
- Meristematic cells divide actively, elongation occurs through cell expansion, and maturation finalizes differentiation.  
- Each phase plays a crucial role in the formation of plant organs and tissues.

### **Slide 3: Growth Patterns and Measurement**  
Content:  
- Plant growth follows either arithmetic or geometric patterns depending on cell division and elongation rates.  
- Growth can be measured through parameters like length, weight, or cell count.  
- The sigmoid growth curve represents the typical pattern observed in plants.

### **Slide 4: Differentiation and Development**  
Content:  
- Differentiation is the process by which cells develop specialized structures and functions.  
- Dedifferentiation allows mature cells to regain division ability, forming secondary meristems.  
- Redifferentiation occurs when dedifferentiated cells mature again into specialized structures.

### **Slide 5: Role of Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs)**  
Content:  
- PGRs are chemical compounds that regulate plant growth and responses to environmental stimuli.  
- There are five major groups: auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.  
- They influence processes such as cell division, flowering, dormancy, and fruit ripening.  

---  

### **Slide 6: Functions of Growth Promoting PGRs**  
Content:  
- Auxins promote root formation, apical dominance, and fruit development.  
- Gibberellins enhance stem elongation, seed germination, and flowering in long-day plants.  
- Cytokinins stimulate cell division, delay senescence, and promote lateral bud growth.  

---  

### **Slide 7: Growth Inhibiting PGRs and Their Effects**  
Content:  
- Abscisic acid induces seed dormancy, stress tolerance, and stomatal closure.  
- Ethylene regulates fruit ripening, leaf abscission, and flower senescence.  
- Both hormones play crucial roles in plant survival under adverse conditions.

### **Slide 8: Environmental Factors Affecting Growth**  
Content:  
- Light influences photoperiodism and photosynthesis, affecting growth cycles.  
- Temperature plays a key role in seed germination, flowering, and overall development.  
- Water and nutrients are essential for metabolic activities, structural integrity, and hormone function.
