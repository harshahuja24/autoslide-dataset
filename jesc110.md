# Main Title: The Human Eye and the Colourful World  


### **Slide 1: Structure of the Human Eye**
Content:  
- The human eye functions like a camera, forming images on a light-sensitive retina.  
- Light enters through the cornea, which provides most of the refraction before reaching the lens.  
- The iris controls the size of the pupil, regulating the amount of light entering the eye.

### **Slide 2: Power of Accommodation**  
Content:  
- The eye lens changes shape to focus on objects at different distances using ciliary muscles.  
- For distant objects, the lens becomes thinner, increasing its focal length for clear vision.  
- For nearby objects, the lens thickens, decreasing its focal length to focus properly.

### **Slide 3: Common Vision Defects**  
Content:  
- Myopia (short-sightedness) makes distant objects appear blurry due to excessive lens curvature or elongated eyeball shape.  
- Hypermetropia (far-sightedness) causes difficulty in seeing nearby objects due to a short eyeball or weak lens.  
- Presbyopia occurs with aging as the eye loses flexibility, making both near and far vision difficult.

### **Slide 4: Correcting Vision Defects**  
Content:  
- Myopia is corrected using concave lenses that diverge light rays before they reach the eye.  
- Hypermetropia is corrected using convex lenses that converge light rays to focus properly on the retina.  
- Presbyopia is corrected using bifocal lenses, combining concave and convex sections for near and distant vision.

### **Slide 5: Refraction of Light Through a Prism**  
Content:  
- Unlike a glass slab, a prism bends light at two different angles due to its inclined surfaces.  
- The incident ray bends towards the normal inside the prism and away from the normal when emerging.  
- The angle of deviation depends on the prism material and the angle of incidence.  

---

### **Slide 6: Dispersion of Light and Spectrum** 
Content:  
- White light splits into seven colors (VIBGYOR) when passing through a prism, forming a spectrum.  
- Different colors bend at different angles, with violet bending the most and red the least.  
- Newton proved that recombining these colors using another prism results in white light.

### **Slide 7: Atmospheric Refraction Effects** 
Content:  
- The twinkling of stars occurs due to the continuous bending of starlight by Earth's atmosphere.  
- The Sun appears higher than its actual position during sunrise and sunset due to refraction.  
- Planets do not twinkle because they appear as extended sources, averaging out atmospheric variations.

### **Slide 8: Scattering of Light in Nature**  
Content:  
- The blue sky results from air molecules scattering shorter-wavelength blue light more than red light.  
- Red light is used in danger signals because it scatters the least and remains visible over long distances.  
- The reddish appearance of the Sun at sunrise and sunset occurs due to the scattering of shorter wavelengths.
