# Main Title: Kinetic Theory  

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Kinetic Theory**  
Content:  
- Kinetic theory explains the behavior of gases based on molecular motion and interactions.  
- It provides a microscopic understanding of macroscopic gas properties like pressure and temperature.  
- This theory supports the derivation of gas laws, including Boyle’s and Charles’ laws.

### **Slide 2: Assumptions of Kinetic Theory**  
Content:  
- A gas consists of a large number of molecules in continuous random motion.  
- Collisions between gas molecules and container walls are perfectly elastic.  
- The intermolecular forces are negligible except during collisions.  

---

### **Slide 3: Pressure of a Gas and Molecular Collisions**  
Content:  
- Gas pressure arises from molecular collisions with container walls, exerting force per unit area.  
- The pressure is directly proportional to the number of molecules and their kinetic energy.  
- The relation P = (1/3) * (N/V) * m * v² explains pressure dependence on molecular motion.

### **Slide 4: Temperature and Kinetic Energy Relation**  
Content:  
- The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to absolute temperature.  
- The relation KE_avg = (3/2) kT shows that temperature increases molecular motion.  
- This explains why gases expand and pressure increases with rising temperature.

### **Slide 5: Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution**  
Content:  
- The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the spread of molecular speeds in a gas.  
- At higher temperatures, more molecules move at greater speeds, broadening the distribution curve.  
- The peak of the curve shifts rightward as temperature increases.

### **Slide 6: Degrees of Freedom and Energy Distribution**  
Content:  
- Degrees of freedom refer to independent modes of motion, affecting energy distribution.  
- The equipartition theorem states that each degree of freedom gets an equal share of thermal energy.  
- Translational, rotational, and vibrational motions contribute to a molecule’s total energy.  

---

### **Slide 7: Mean Free Path and Collision Frequency**  
Content:  
- The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels before colliding with another.  
- It depends on gas density and molecule size, influencing diffusion and viscosity.  
- Collision frequency increases with pressure and decreases with increasing temperature.

### **Slide 8: Applications of Kinetic Theory**  
Content:  
- Explains diffusion, effusion, and gas viscosity observed in real-world scenarios.  
- Helps in designing efficient gas storage, vacuum systems, and propulsion technologies.  
- Forms the basis for understanding thermodynamic properties and statistical mechanics.
