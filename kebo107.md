# Main Title: Structural Organisation in Animals  

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Structural Organisation**  
Content:  
- Multicellular animals perform basic functions through specialized cells organized into tissues, organs, and systems.  
- Simple organisms like Hydra have a few cell types, while complex animals have billions of cells with division of labor.  
- The body systems coordinate for efficient functioning, supporting growth, reproduction, and survival.

### **Slide 2: Levels of Organisation in Animals**  
Content:  
- Cells group together to form tissues, which in turn organize into functional organs and systems.  
- Different animals exhibit varying levels of organization, from cellular to organ-system levels.  
- Organ systems like the digestive, circulatory, and nervous systems ensure coordinated body functions.

### **Slide 3: Animal Tissues and Their Types**  
Content:  
- Four basic types of animal tissues include epithelial, connective, muscular, and nervous tissues.  
- Epithelial tissues form protective layers, connective tissues provide support, and muscular tissues enable movement.  
- Nervous tissues coordinate responses by transmitting electrical impulses between different body parts.

### **Slide 4: Organ and Organ Systems**  
Content:  
- Organs are composed of multiple tissue types that work together to perform specific biological functions.  
- Organ systems like the respiratory, circulatory, and excretory systems regulate essential physiological processes.  
- Evolutionary trends show increasing complexity from simple to highly specialized organ systems in animals.

### **Slide 5: Morphology and Anatomy of Frogs**  
Content:  
- Frogs belong to class Amphibia and exhibit both aquatic and terrestrial adaptations.  
- They have smooth, mucus-covered skin for respiration, and their limbs are adapted for jumping and swimming.  
- Sexual dimorphism is seen in male frogs, which possess vocal sacs and nuptial pads.

### **Slide 6: Frogâ€™s Digestive and Respiratory Systems**  
Content:  
- The digestive system includes an alimentary canal and digestive glands, with food absorption occurring in the intestine.  
- Frogs capture prey using a bilobed tongue, and digestion begins with gastric secretions in the stomach.  
- Respiration occurs through the skin (cutaneous), lungs (pulmonary), and buccal cavity, depending on conditions.

### **Slide 7: Circulatory and Excretory Systems of Frogs**  
Content:  
- Frogs have a three-chambered heart, closed circulatory system, and a lymphatic system aiding in fluid balance.  
- Blood circulation involves single and double pathways, including hepatic and renal portal systems.  
- The excretory system consists of kidneys, ureters, a urinary bladder, and the cloaca, eliminating nitrogenous waste.

### **Slide 8: Nervous System and Reproduction in Frogs**  
Content:  
- The nervous system comprises the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, coordinating movement and responses.  
- Frogs possess well-developed sense organs, including eyes with a nictitating membrane and a tympanum for hearing.  
- The reproductive system involves external fertilization, with females laying thousands of eggs in water.
