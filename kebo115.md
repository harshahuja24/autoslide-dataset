# Main Title: Body Fluids and Circulation  

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Circulatory System**  
Content:  
- The circulatory system transports nutrients, gases, hormones, and waste products throughout the body.  
- Simple organisms rely on diffusion, while complex organisms use specialized fluids like blood and lymph.  
- Blood is the primary transport medium in higher animals, while lymph assists in immune functions and fluid balance.

### **Slide 2: Composition of Blood**  
Content:  
- Blood consists of plasma (55%) and formed elements (45%), including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.  
- Plasma contains water, proteins like albumins and globulins, minerals, and clotting factors.  
- RBCs transport oxygen, WBCs defend against infections, and platelets help in clotting.

### **Slide 3: Blood Groups and Transfusions**  
Content:  
- The ABO blood group system is based on the presence of antigen A and B on RBCs.  
- Rh factor determines whether a person is Rh-positive or Rh-negative, important for blood transfusions.  
- Incompatibility between maternal and fetal blood types can cause erythroblastosis fetalis.

### **Slide 4: Coagulation of Blood**  
Content:  
- Blood clotting prevents excessive blood loss by forming a fibrin mesh at injury sites.  
- Platelets release clotting factors that convert prothrombin to thrombin, which activates fibrin formation.  
- Calcium ions play a crucial role in the clotting process, ensuring rapid wound healing.

### **Slide 5: Human Circulatory System**  
Content:  
- The circulatory system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood.  
- The heart has four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, separated by valves.  
- Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, while veins return deoxygenated blood.  

---  

### **Slide 6: Cardiac Cycle and Heart Function**  
Content:  
- The cardiac cycle consists of atrial systole, ventricular systole, and joint diastole phases.  
- The sinoatrial node (SA node) initiates electrical impulses, making the heart myogenic.  
- The heart pumps approximately 5 liters of blood per minute, adapting to body needs.

### **Slide 7: Double Circulation in Humans**  
Content:  
- Double circulation consists of pulmonary circulation (heart to lungs) and systemic circulation (heart to body).  
- Pulmonary circulation oxygenates blood, while systemic circulation delivers oxygen and nutrients.  
- This separation prevents the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, ensuring efficient transport.

### **Slide 8: Circulatory Disorders and Health Risks**  
Content:  
- Hypertension (high blood pressure) can lead to heart disease and organ damage.  
- Atherosclerosis occurs due to plaque buildup in arteries, restricting blood flow to the heart.  
- Angina and heart failure are serious conditions affecting cardiac function, requiring medical attention.
