# Main Title: Morphology of Flowering Plants  

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Morphology of Flowering Plants**  
Content:  
- Flowering plants exhibit diverse external structures, including roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits.  
- Morphology helps classify plants and understand adaptations to different environments.  
- Standard botanical terminology is used to describe variations in plant structures for scientific study.

### **Slide 2: Root System and Its Types**  
Content:  
- The root is the underground part that anchors the plant and absorbs water and nutrients.  
- Taproots arise from the radicle and form a main root with lateral branches, as seen in dicots.  
- Fibrous and adventitious roots develop from the stem base, commonly found in monocots like wheat.

### **Slide 3: Functions and Modifications of Roots**  
Content:  
- Roots store food in plants like carrots and beets, providing essential nutrients for survival.  
- Some roots, like in banyan trees, provide additional support and are known as prop roots.  
- Respiratory roots, or pneumatophores, help plants like mangroves absorb oxygen in waterlogged conditions.

### **Slide 4: The Stem and Its Functions**  
Content:  
- The stem supports leaves, flowers, and fruits, enabling efficient nutrient and water transport.  
- It originates from the plumule of the embryo and contains nodes, internodes, and buds.  
- Modified stems store food (potato), provide support (tendrils), and aid reproduction (stolons).

### **Slide 5: Leaves and Their Adaptations**  
Content:  
- Leaves are the main sites of photosynthesis and gas exchange, with structures like petioles and lamina.  
- They show variations like simple (mango) and compound (neem) based on leaf blade division.  
- Leaf modifications include spines in cacti for water conservation and tendrils for climbing.

### **Slide 6: Inflorescence and Flower Structure**  
Content:  
- Inflorescence refers to the arrangement of flowers on a plantâ€™s axis, classified as racemose or cymose.  
- A complete flower has sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels, essential for reproduction.  
- The ovary position determines flower types: hypogynous (superior ovary), perigynous, or epigynous (inferior ovary).  

---

### **Slide 7: Fruits and Their Types**  
Content:  
- Fruits develop from fertilized ovaries and aid in seed protection and dispersal.  
- Simple fruits develop from single ovaries, while aggregate fruits arise from multiple ovaries in one flower.  
- Parthenocarpic fruits, like bananas, develop without fertilization, lacking seeds.

### **Slide 8: Seeds and Their Structure**  
Content:  
- Seeds contain an embryo, stored food, and a protective coat for germination.  
- Dicot seeds (pea) have two cotyledons, while monocot seeds (maize) contain a single cotyledon.  
- The hilum marks seed attachment, while the micropyle allows water absorption for germination.
