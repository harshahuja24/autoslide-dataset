# Main Title: Systems of Particles and Rotational Motion  

---

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Rotational Motion**  
Content:  
- Rotational motion involves the movement of a rigid body about a fixed axis, where every particle moves in a circular path.  
- A rigid body is an idealization where the distances between particles remain constant, even under external forces.  
- Examples of rotational motion include ceiling fans, wheels, and spinning tops, where the axis of rotation may be fixed or moving.  

---

### **Slide 2: Centre of Mass**  
Content:  
- The centre of mass (CM) of a system of particles is the point where the entire mass of the system can be assumed to be concentrated.  
- For a two-particle system, the CM is given by \( X = \frac{m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2}{m_1 + m_2} \).  
- The CM moves as if all external forces act directly on it, simplifying the analysis of complex systems.  

---

### **Slide 3: Motion of the Centre of Mass**  
Content:  
- The velocity of the CM is given by \( V = \frac{P}{M} \), where \( P \) is the total linear momentum of the system.  
- If the total external force on a system is zero, the CM moves with constant velocity.  
- The CM concept is crucial in analyzing both translational and rotational motion of rigid bodies.

### **Slide 4: Angular Velocity and Linear Velocity**  
Content:  
- Angular velocity (\( \omega \)) is a vector quantity that describes the rate of rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis.  
- The linear velocity (\( v \)) of a particle in a rotating body is related to angular velocity by \( v = \omega r \), where \( r \) is the distance from the axis.  
- For a rigid body, all particles have the same angular velocity but different linear velocities depending on their distance from the axis.  

---

### **Slide 5: Torque and Angular Momentum**  
Content:  
- Torque (\( \tau \)) is the rotational analogue of force and is defined as \( \tau = r \times F \), where \( r \) is the position vector and \( F \) is the force.  
- Angular momentum (\( L \)) of a particle is given by \( L = r \times p \), where \( p \) is the linear momentum.  
- For a system of particles, the total angular momentum is the vector sum of individual angular momenta.  

---

### **Slide 6: Equilibrium of a Rigid Body**  
Content:  
- A rigid body is in mechanical equilibrium if both the total external force and the total external torque acting on it are zero.  
- Translational equilibrium requires \( \sum F = 0 \), while rotational equilibrium requires \( \sum \tau = 0 \).  
- Examples of equilibrium include a balanced see-saw and a stationary ladder leaning against a wall.  

---

### **Slide 7: Moment of Inertia**  
Content:  
- Moment of inertia (\( I \)) is the rotational analogue of mass and is defined as \( I = \sum m_i r_i^2 \), where \( r_i \) is the distance from the axis.  
- The kinetic energy of a rotating body is given by \( K = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 \).  
- The moment of inertia depends on the mass distribution and the axis of rotation.  

---

### **Slide 8: Conservation of Angular Momentum**  
Content:  
- If the total external torque on a system is zero, the total angular momentum of the system is conserved.  
- This principle is applied in situations like spinning ice skaters and rotating planets.  
- Conservation of angular momentum explains why a spinning top remains upright and why a bicycle wheel stabilizes when rotating.
