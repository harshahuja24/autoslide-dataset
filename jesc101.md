# Main Title: Chemical Reactions and Equations  

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Chemical Reactions**  
Content:  
- Chemical reactions involve the transformation of substances into new products with different properties  
- Common indicators of chemical reactions include changes in color, temperature, gas evolution, and state  
- Examples of chemical reactions in daily life include rusting, cooking, and digestion  

---

### **Slide 2: Writing Chemical Equations**  
Content:  
- Chemical equations represent reactions using symbols and formulae of reactants and products  
- Word equations describe reactions in words, while balanced equations ensure the conservation of mass  
- Balancing equations involves adjusting coefficients to equalize atoms on both sides

### **Slide 3: Types of Chemical Reactions**  
Content:  
- Combination reactions involve two or more substances combining to form a single product  
- Decomposition reactions involve a single substance breaking down into simpler substances  
- Displacement reactions occur when a more reactive element replaces a less reactive one in a compound  

---

### **Slide 4: Combination and Decomposition Reactions**  
Content:  
- Combination reactions are exothermic, releasing heat, e.g., burning of coal or formation of water  
- Decomposition reactions require energy (heat, light, or electricity) to break down compounds  
- Examples include the decomposition of ferrous sulphate or calcium carbonate

### **Slide 5: Displacement and Double Displacement Reactions**  
Content:  
- Displacement reactions involve one element replacing another in a compound, e.g., iron displacing copper  
- Double displacement reactions involve the exchange of ions between two compounds, forming precipitates  
- Examples include the reaction between sodium sulphate and barium chloride

### **Slide 6: Oxidation and Reduction (Redox Reactions)**  
Content:  
- Oxidation involves the gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen, while reduction involves the loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen  
- Redox reactions involve both oxidation and reduction occurring simultaneously  
- Examples include the oxidation of copper and the reduction of copper oxide by hydrogen  

---

### **Slide 7: Effects of Oxidation in Daily Life**  
Content:  
- Corrosion is the oxidation of metals, e.g., rusting of iron or tarnishing of silver  
- Rancidity is the oxidation of fats and oils, leading to unpleasant smells and tastes  
- Antioxidants and airtight containers are used to prevent rancidity in food

### **Slide 8: Balancing Chemical Equations**  
Content:  
- Balancing equations ensures the law of conservation of mass is followed  
- Steps include counting atoms, adjusting coefficients, and verifying the balance  
- Example: Balancing the equation for the reaction between iron and water to form iron oxide and hydrogen
