# Main Title: Units and Measurement  

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Units and Measurement**  
Content:  
- Measurement of physical quantities involves comparison with a standard unit.  
- A system of units includes both fundamental (base) units and derived units.  
- The International System of Units (SI) is the globally accepted system for scientific measurements.

### **Slide 2: The International System of Units (SI)**  
Content:  
- SI is based on seven base units: metre (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (current), kelvin (temperature), mole (amount of substance), and candela (luminous intensity).  
- Derived units are combinations of base units, such as newton (force) and joule (energy).  
- SI units are decimal-based, making conversions straightforward.

### **Slide 3: Significant Figures**  
Content:  
- Significant figures indicate the precision of a measurement.  
- Rules for determining significant figures:  
  - All non-zero digits are significant.  
  - Zeros between non-zero digits are significant.  
  - Trailing zeros in a number with a decimal point are significant.  
- Scientific notation is used to avoid ambiguity in significant figures.

### **Slide 4: Dimensions of Physical Quantities**  
Content:  
- Dimensions describe the nature of physical quantities in terms of base quantities (length, mass, time, etc.).  
- Dimensional formulae express how base quantities are combined to form derived quantities.  
- Example: The dimensional formula for force is \([M L T^{-2}]\).

### **Slide 5: Dimensional Analysis**  
Content:  
- Dimensional analysis checks the consistency of equations by comparing dimensions on both sides.  
- It helps derive relationships between physical quantities.  
- Example: Deriving the time period of a pendulum using dimensional analysis.

### **Slide 6: Applications of Dimensional Analysis**  
Content:  
- Dimensional analysis is used to verify the correctness of equations.  
- It helps in deriving relationships between physical quantities.  
- Limitations: It cannot determine dimensionless constants or exact relationships.

### **Slide 7: Rounding Off and Arithmetic Operations**  
Content:  
- Rounding off ensures the correct number of significant figures in calculations.  
- Rules for arithmetic operations:  
  - In multiplication/division, the result has the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement.  
  - In addition/subtraction, the result has the same number of decimal places as the least precise measurement.

### **Slide 8: Importance of Units and Measurement**  
Content:  
- Accurate measurement and consistent units are essential for scientific experiments and calculations.  
- Dimensional analysis ensures the correctness of physical equations.  
- Understanding units and measurements forms the foundation of physics.
