# Main Title: Metals and Non-Metals  

### **Slide 1: Physical Properties of Metals**  
Content:  
- Metals are lustrous, malleable, ductile, and good conductors of heat and electricity  
- Most metals are solid at room temperature, except mercury, which is liquid  
- Metals like gold and silver are highly malleable and ductile

### **Slide 2: Physical Properties of Non-Metals**  
Content:  
- Non-metals are generally brittle, dull, and poor conductors of heat and electricity  
- Non-metals can be solids, liquids, or gases at room temperature  
- Examples include carbon, sulphur, and oxygen

### **Slide 3: Chemical Properties of Metals**  
Content:  
- Metals react with oxygen to form metal oxides, which are usually basic  
- Metals react with water to produce metal hydroxides and hydrogen gas  
- Metals react with acids to form salts and hydrogen gas  

---

### **Slide 4: Reactivity Series of Metals**  
Content:  
- The reactivity series arranges metals in order of their reactivity with oxygen, water, and acids  
- Highly reactive metals like potassium and sodium are at the top, while less reactive metals like gold and silver are at the bottom  
- The reactivity series helps predict displacement reactions

### **Slide 5: Extraction of Metals**  
Content:  
- Metals are extracted from their ores through processes like roasting, calcination, and electrolysis  
- Metals low in the reactivity series are extracted by heating their oxides  
- Metals high in the reactivity series are extracted by electrolysis of their molten salts

### **Slide 6: Corrosion and Its Prevention**  
Content:  
- Corrosion is the degradation of metals due to reactions with oxygen and moisture  
- Common examples include rusting of iron and tarnishing of silver  
- Corrosion can be prevented by painting, galvanizing, or alloying

### **Slide 7: Alloys and Their Uses**  
Content:  
- Alloys are mixtures of metals or metals with non-metals, designed to improve properties  
- Examples include stainless steel (iron, chromium, nickel) and brass (copper, zinc)  
- Alloys are used in construction, jewelry, and electrical applications  

---

### **Slide 8: Ionic Compounds and Their Properties**  
Content:  
- Ionic compounds are formed by the transfer of electrons from metals to non-metals  
- They have high melting and boiling points, are soluble in water, and conduct electricity in molten or aqueous states  
- Examples include sodium chloride (NaCl) and magnesium oxide (MgO)
