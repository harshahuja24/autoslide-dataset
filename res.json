        "input": "The Periodic Table is arguably the most important concept in chemistry, both in principle and in practice. It is the \neveryday support for students, it suggests new avenues \nof research to professionals, and it provides a succinct \norganization of the whole of chemistry. It is a remarkable \ndemonstration of the fact that the chemical elements are \nnot a random cluster of entities but instead display trends \nand lie together in families. An awareness of the Periodic \nTable is essential to anyone who wishes to disentangle \nthe world and see how it is built up from the fundamental \nbuilding blocks of the chemistry, the chemical elements. Glenn T. SeaborgUNIT 3CLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIESAfter studying this Unit, you will be able to •\tappreciate how the concept of grouping elements in accordance \nto their properties led to the \ndevelopment of Periodic Table.•\tunderstand  the Periodic Law; •\tunderstand\tthe\t\tsignificance\tof\tatomic number and electronic \nconfiguration as the basis for �periodic\tclassification;•\tname the elements with  Z \u003e100 according to IUPAC nomenclature; •\tclassify elements into s, p, d, f blocks and learn their main characteristics;•\trecognise the periodic trends in \nphysical and chemical properties \nof elements;•\tcompare the reactivity of elements \nand correlate it with their \noccurrence in nature;•\texplain the relationship  between \nionization enthalpy and metallic \ncharacter;•\tuse  scientific  vocabulary \nappropriately to communicate \nideas related to certain important \nproperties of atoms e.g., \natomic/ionic radii, ionization \nenthalpy, electron gain enthalpy, \nelectronegativity, valence of \nelements. In this Unit, we will study the historical development of the \nPeriodic Table as it stands today and the Modern Periodic �Law.\tWe\twill\talso\tlearn\thow\tthe\tperiodic\tclassification\tfollows as a logical consequence of the electronic configuration\tof\tatoms.\tFinally,\twe\tshall\texamine\tsome\tof\tthe periodic trends in the physical and chemical properties of the elements.3.1 WHY DO WE NEED TO CLASSIFY ELEMENTS ?We know by now that the elements are the basic units of all types of matter. In 1800, only 31 elements were known. By\t\t1865,\tthe\tnumber\tof\tidentified\telements\thad\tmore\tthan\tdoubled to 63. At present 114 elements are known. Of them, the recently discovered elements are man-made. \nEfforts to synthesise new elements are continuing. With �such\ta\tlarge\tnumber\tof\telements\tit\tis\tvery\tdifficult\tto\tstudy individually the chemistry of all these elements and their innumerable compounds individually. To ease out \nthis problem, scientists searched for a systematic way to \norganise their knowledge by classifying the elements. Not \nonly that it would rationalize known chemical facts about \nelements, but even predict new ones for undertaking \nfurther study. Unit 3.indd   749/9/2022   4:36:12 PM753.2 GENESIS OF PERIODIC CLASSIFICATIONClassification\tof\telements\tinto\tgroups\tand\tdevelopment of Periodic Law and Periodic Table are the consequences of systematising the knowledge gained by a number of \nscientists through their observations and \nexperiments. The German chemist, Johann �Dobereiner\tin\tearly\t1800’s\twas\tthe\tfirst\tto\tconsider the idea of trends among properties \nof elements. By 1829 he noted a similarity \namong the physical and chemical properties \nof several groups of three elements (Triads). In each case, he noticed that the middle  element  of each of the Triads had an atomic weight about half way between the atomic weights of the other two (Table 3.1). Also the properties \nof the middle element were in between those \nof the other two members. Since Dobereiner’s the periodic recurrence of properties. This \nalso did not attract much attention. The \nEnglish chemist, John Alexander Newlands \nin 1865 profounded the Law of Octaves. He arranged the elements in increasing order \nof their atomic weights and noted that every eighth element had properties similar to the �first\telement\t(Table\t3.2).\tThe\trelationship\twas\tjust like every eighth note that resembles the �first\tin\toctaves\tof\tmusic.\tNewlands’s\tLaw\tof\tOctaves seemed to be true only for elements \nup to calcium. Although his idea was not widely accepted at that time, he, for his work, \nwas later awarded Davy Medal in 1887 by the \nRoyal Society, London.The Periodic Law, as we know it today owes its development to the Russian chemist, \nDmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) and the \nGerman chemist, Lothar Meyer (1830-1895).

The next reported attempt to classify elements was made by a �French\tgeologist,\tA.E.B.\tde\tChancourtois\tin\t1862. He arranged the then known elements \nin order of increasing atomic weights and \nmade a cylindrical table of elements to display Working independently, both the chemists in \n1869 proposed that on arranging elements in  the increasing order of their atomic weights, \nsimilarities appear in physical and chemical \nproperties at regular intervals. Lothar Meyer \nplotted the physical properties such as \natomic volume, melting point and boiling \npoint against atomic weight and obtained Unit 3.indd   759/9/2022   4:36:12 PM76a periodically repeated pattern. Unlike Newlands, Lothar Meyer observed a change \nin length of that repeating pattern. By 1868, \nLothar Meyer had developed a table of the \nelements that closely resembles the Modern \nPeriodic Table. However, his work was not \npublished until after the work of Dmitri \nMendeleev, the scientist who is generally \ncredited with the development of the Modern \nPeriodic Table.While Dobereiner initiated the study of periodic relationship, it was Mendeleev who \nwas responsible for publishing the Periodic �Law\tfor\tthe\tfirst\ttime.\tIt\tstates\tas\tfollows\t:The properties of the elements are a periodic function of their atomic \nweights.Mendeleev arranged elements in horizontal \nrows and vertical columns of a table in order \nof their increasing atomic weights in such a \nway that the elements with similar properties \noccupied the same vertical column or group. \nMendeleev’s system of classifying elements \nwas more elaborate than that of Lothar �Meyer’s.\tHe\tfully\trecognized\tthe\tsignificance\tof periodicity and used broader range of physical and chemical properties to classify \nthe elements. In particular, Mendeleev relied \non the similarities in the empirical formulas \nand properties of the compounds formed by \nthe elements. He realized that some of the �elements\tdid\tnot\tfit\tin\twith\this\tscheme\tof\tclassification\tif\tthe\torder\tof\tatomic\tweight\twas strictly followed. He ignored the order of atomic weights, thinking that the atomic measurements might be incorrect, and placed \nthe elements with similar properties together. �For\texample,\tiodine\twith\tlower\tatomic\tweight\tthan that of tellurium (Group VI) was placed in\tGroup\tVII\talong\twith\tfluorine,\tchlorine,\tbromine because of similarities in properties �(Fig.\t3.1).\tAt\tthe\tsame\ttime,\tkeeping\this\tprimary aim of arranging the elements of similar properties in the same group, he \nproposed that some of the elements were \nstill undiscovered and, therefore, left several �gaps\tin\tthe\ttable.\tFor\texample,\tboth\tgallium\tand germanium were unknown at the time Mendeleev published his Periodic Table. He left the gap under aluminium and a gap \nunder silicon, and called these elements \nEka-Aluminium and Eka-Silicon. Mendeleev predicted not only the existence of gallium and germanium, but also described some of their \ngeneral physical properties.  These elements \nwere discovered later. Some of the properties \npredicted by Mendeleev for these elements \nand those found experimentally are listed in  Table 3.3. The boldness of Mendeleev’s quantitative predictions and their eventual success \nmade him and his Periodic Table famous. \nMendeleev’s Periodic Table published in 1905 �is\tshown\tin\tFig.\t3.1.Table 3.3 Mendeleev’s Predictions for the Elements Eka-aluminium (Gallium) and  Eka-silicon (Germanium)PropertyEka-aluminium (predicted)Gallium (found)Eka-silicon (predicted)Germanium (found)Atomic weight68707272.6Density/(g/cm3)5.95.945.55.36Melting point/KLow302.93High1231Formula of oxideE2O3Ga2O3EO2GeO2Formula of chlorideE Cl3GaCl3ECl4GeCl4Unit 3.indd   769/9/2022   4:36:12 PM77PERIODIC\tSYSTEM\tOF\tTHE\tELEMENTS\tIN\tGROUPS\tAND\tSERIESFig. 3.1  Mendeleev’s Periodic Table published earlierUnit 3.indd   779/9/2022   4:36:12 PM783.3 MODERN PERIODIC LAW AND THE PRESENT FORM OF THE PERIODIC TABLEWe must bear in mind that when Mendeleev developed his Periodic Table, chemists knew nothing about the internal structure of atom. However, the beginning of the 20th century witnessed profound developments \nin theories about sub-atomic particles. In 1913, the English physicist, Henry Moseley \nobserved regularities in the characteristic \nX-ray spectra of the elements. A plot of  (where \tis frequency of X-rays emitted) against atomic number (Z) gave a straight line and not the plot of  vs atomic mass. He thereby showed that the atomic number is a more fundamental property of an element \nthan its atomic mass. Mendeleev’s Periodic Law\twas,\ttherefore,\taccordingly\tmodified.\tThis\tis known as the Modern Periodic Law and can\tbe\tstated\tas\t:The physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic functions \nof their atomic numbers.The Periodic Law revealed important analogies among the 94 naturally occurring elements (neptunium and plutonium like \nactinium and protoactinium are also found \nin pitch blende – an ore of uranium). It \nstimulated renewed interest in Inorganic \nChemistry and has carried into the present \nwith the creation of artificially produced \nshort-lived elements.You may recall that the atomic number is equal to the nuclear charge (i.e., number of protons) or the number of electrons in \na neutral atom. It is then easy to visualize �the\tsignificance\tof\tquantum\tnumbers\tand\telectronic\tconfigurations\tin\tperiodicity\tof\telements. In fact, it is now recognized that the Periodic Law is essentially the consequence \nof the periodic variation in electronic �configurations,\twhich\tindeed\tdetermine\tthe\tphysical and chemical properties of elements and their compounds.Numerous forms of Periodic Table have been devised from time to time. Some forms emphasise chemical reactions and valence, whereas others stress the electronic �configuration\tof\telements.\tA\tmodern\tversion,\tthe so-called “long form” of the Periodic Table\tof\tthe\telements\t(Fig.\t3.2),\tis\tthe\tmost\tconvenient and widely used. The horizontal \nrows (which Mendeleev called series) are called periods and the vertical columns, groups. Elements having similar outer \nelectronic configurations in their atoms \nare arranged in vertical columns, referred \nto as groups or families. According to the recommendation of International Union of \nPure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the \ngroups are numbered from 1 to 18 replacing \nthe older notation of groups IA …  VIIA, VIII, \nIB …  VIIB and 0.There are altogether seven periods. The period number corresponds to the highest principal quantum number (n) of the elements in\tthe\tperiod.\tThe\tfirst\tperiod\tcontains\t2\telements. The subsequent periods consists of 8, 8, 18, 18 and 32 elements, respectively. The \nseventh period is incomplete and like the sixth \nperiod would have a theoretical maximum \n(on the basis of quantum numbers) of 32 \nelements. In this form of the Periodic Table, \n14 elements of both sixth and seventh periods \n(lanthanoids and actinoids, respectively) are \nplaced in separate panels at the bottom*.3.4 NOMENCLATURE OF ELEMENTS WITH ATOMIC NUMBERS \u003e 100The naming of the new elements had been traditionally the privilege of the discoverer \n(or discoverers) and the suggested name was �ratified\tby\tthe\tIUPAC.\tIn\trecent\tyears\tthis\thas\tled to some controversy. The new elements \nwith very high atomic numbers are so unstable that only minute quantities, sometimes only * Glenn T. Seaborgs work in the middle of the 20th century starting with the discovery of plutonium in 1940, followed by those of all the transuranium elements from 94 to 102 led to reconﬁguration of the periodic table placing the actinoids below the lanthanoids. In 1951, Seaborg was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work. Element 106 has been named \nSeaborgium (Sg) in his honour.Unit 3.indd   789/9/2022   4:36:13 PM79Fig. 3.2  Long form of the Periodic Table of the Elements with their atomic numbers and ground state outer electronic configurations. The groups are numbered 1-18 in accordance with the 1984 IUPAC recommendations. This notation replaces the old numbering scheme of  IA–VIIA, VIII, IB–VIIB and 0 for the elements.

Their synthesis and characterisation, therefore, \nrequire highly sophisticated costly equipment \nand laboratory. Such work is carried out with \ncompetitive spirit only in some laboratories \nin the world. Scientists, before collecting the \nreliable data on the new element, at times �get\ttempted\tto\tclaim\tfor\tits\tdiscovery.\tFor\texample, both American and Soviet scientists claimed credit for discovering element 104. The Americans named it Rutherfordium \nwhereas Soviets named it Kurchatovium. To \navoid such problems, the IUPAC has made \nrecommendation that until a new element’s �discovery\tis\tproved,\tand\tits\tname\tis\tofficially\trecognised, a systematic nomenclature be \nderived directly from the atomic number of the element using the numerical roots for \n0 and numbers 1-9. These are shown in  Table 3.4. The roots are put together in order of digits which make up the atomic number and “ium” is added at the end. The IUPAC names \nfor elements with Z above 100 are shown in  Table 3.5.Table 3.5  Nomenclature of Elements with Atomic Number Above 100AtomicNumberName according toIUPAC nomenclatureSymbolIUPACOfficial NameIUPACSymbol101102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n117\n118Unnilunium\nUnnilbium\nUnniltrium\nUnnilquadium\nUnnilpentium\nUnnilhexium\nUnnilseptium\nUnniloctium\nUnnilennium\nUnunnillium\nUnununnium\nUnunbium\nUnuntrium\nUnunquadium\nUnunpentium\nUnunhexium\nUnunseptium\nUnunoctiumUnuUnbUntUnqUnpUnhUnsUnoUneUunUuuUubUutUuqUupUuhUusUuoMendelevium\nNobelium\nLawrencium\nRutherfordium\nDubnium\nSeaborgium\nBohrium\nHassium\nMeitnerium\nDarmstadtium\nRontgenium\nCopernicium\nNihonium�Flerovium\nMoscovium\nLivermorium\nTennessine\nOganessonMdNoLr\nRfDbSgBhHsMtDsRgCn NhFlMcLvTsOgTable 3.4 Notation for IUPAC Nomenclature of ElementsDigitNameAbbreviation01\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9nilunbitriquadpenthexseptoctennnubtqphsoeUnit 3.indd   809/9/2022   4:36:13 PM81Thus, the new element first gets a temporary name, with symbol consisting of three letters.

Hence, \nthe symbol and the name respectively \nare Ubn and unbinilium.3.5 ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS OF ELEMENTS AND THE PERIODIC TABLEIn the preceding unit we have learnt that an electron in an atom is characterised by a set \nof four quantum numbers, and the principal \nquantum number (n\t)\tdefines\tthe\tmain\tenergy\tlevel known as shell. We have also studied about\tthe\tfilling\tof\telectrons\tinto\tdifferent\tsubshells, also referred to as orbitals (s, p, \nd, f) in an atom. The distribution of electrons into orbitals of an atom is called its electronic configuration. An element’s location in the �Periodic\tTable\treflects\tthe\tquantum\tnumbers\tof\tthe\tlast\torbital\tfilled.\tIn\tthis\tsection\twe\twill observe a direct connection between the �electronic\tconfigurations\tof\tthe\telements\tand\tthe long form of the Periodic Table.(a)  Electronic Configurations in PeriodsThe period indicates the value of n for the outermost or valence shell. In other words, successive period in the Periodic Table is �associated\twith\tthe\tfilling\tof\tthe\tnext\thigher\tprincipal energy level (n = 1, n = 2, etc.). It can be readily seen that the number of elements in each period is twice the number of atomic \norbitals available in the energy level that is �being\tfilled.\tThe\tfirst\tperiod\t(n = 1) starts with the\tfilling\tof\tthe\tlowest\tlevel\t(1s) and therefore has two elements — hydrogen (ls1) and helium (ls2)\twhen\tthe\tfirst\tshell\t(K) is completed. The second period (n = 2) starts with lithium and the third electron enters the 2s orbital. The next \nelement, beryllium has four electrons and has �the\telectronic\tconfiguration\t1s22s2. Starting from the next element boron, the 2p orbitals �are\tfilled\twith\telectrons\twhen\tthe\tL shell is completed at neon (2s22p6). Thus there are  8 elements in the second period. The third \nperiod (n = 3) begins at sodium, and the added electron enters a 3s\torbital.\tSuccessive\tfilling\tof 3s and 3p orbitals gives rise to the third period of 8 elements from sodium to argon. The \nfourth period (n = 4) starts at potassium, and �the\tadded\telectrons\tfill\tup\tthe\t4s orbital. Now you may note that before the 4p\torbital\tis\tfilled,\tfilling\tup\tof\t3d orbitals becomes energetically favourable and we come across the so called 3d transition series of elements. This starts from \nscandium (Z = 21) which has the electronic configuration\t3d14s2. The 3d\torbitals\tare\tfilled\tat zinc (Z=30)\twith\telectronic\tconfiguration\t 3d104s2. The fourth period ends at krypton with\tthe\tfilling\tup\tof\tthe\t4p orbitals. Altogether we have 18 elements in this fourth period. The fifth\tperiod\t(n = 5) beginning with rubidium is similar to the fourth period and contains \nthe 4d transition series starting at yttrium  (Z = 39). This period ends at xenon with the �filling\tup\tof\tthe\t5p orbitals. The sixth period  (n = 6) contains 32 elements and successive electrons enter 6s, 4f, 5d and 6p orbitals, in �the\torder\t—\tfilling\tup\tof\tthe\t4f orbitals begins with cerium (Z = 58) and ends at lutetium  (Z = 71) to give the 4f-inner transition series \nwhich is called the lanthanoid series. The \nseventh period (n = 7) is similar to the sixth �period\twith\tthe\tsuccessive\tfilling\tup\tof\tthe\t7s, 5f, 6d and 7p orbitals and includes most of the man-made radioactive elements. This \nperiod will end at the element with atomic \nnumber 118 which would belong to the noble gas family.\tFilling\tup\tof\tthe\t5f orbitals after Unit 3.indd   819/9/2022   4:36:13 PM82actinium (Z = 89) gives the 5f-inner transition series known as the actinoid series. The 4f- and 5f-inner transition series of elements \nare placed separately in the Periodic Table \nto maintain its structure and to preserve the �principle\tof\tclassification\tby\tkeeping\telements\twith similar properties in a single column.Problem 3.2How would you justify the presence of 18 elements in the 5th period of the Periodic Table?SolutionWhen n = 5, l = 0, 1, 2, 3. The order in which the energy of the available orbitals 4d, 5s and 5p increases is 5s \n\u003c 4d \u003c 5p. The total number of orbitals available are 9. The maximum number \nof electrons that can be accommodated \nis 18; and therefore 18 elements are there in the 5th period.(b) Groupwise Electronic ConfigurationsElements in the same vertical column or group have similar valence shell electronic �configurations,\tthe\tsame\tnumber\tof\telectrons\tin the outer orbitals, and similar properties. �For\texample,\tthe\tGroup\t1\telements\t(alkali\tmetals) all have ns1 valence shell electronic configuration\tas\tshown\tbelow.a theoretical foundation for the periodic classification.\tThe\telements\tin\ta\tvertical\tcolumn\tof the Periodic Table constitute a group or family and exhibit similar chemical behaviour. \nThis similarity arises because these elements \nhave the same number and same distribution \nof electrons in their outermost orbitals. We \ncan classify the elements into four blocks viz.,   \ns-block, p-block, d-block and f-block depending on the type of atomic orbitals that �are\tbeing\tfilled\twith\telectrons.\tThis\tis\tillustrated\tin\tFig.\t3.3.\tWe\tnotice\ttwo\texceptions\tto\tthis\tcategorisation. Strictly, helium belongs to the  s-block but its positioning in the p-block along with other group 18 elements is �justified\tbecause\tit\thas\ta\tcompletely\tfilled\tvalence shell (1s2) and as a result, exhibits properties characteristic of other noble gases. \nThe other exception is hydrogen. It has only \none s-electron and hence can be placed in  group 1 (alkali metals). It can also \ngain an electron to achieve a noble gas \narrangement and hence it can behave \nsimilar to a group 17 (halogen family) \nelements. Because it is a special case, we \nshall place hydrogen separately at the top of �the\tPeriodic\tTable\tas\tshown\tin\tFig.\t3.2\tand\t Fig.\t3.3.\tWe\twill\tbriefly\tdiscuss\tthe\tsalient\tfeatures of the four types of elements marked in the Periodic Table. More about these elements Thus it can be seen that the properties of an element have periodic dependence upon its atomic number and not on relative atomic mass.3.6 ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS AND TYPES OF ELEMENTS:  S-, P-, D-, F- BLOCKSThe aufbau (build up) principle and the electronic configuration of atoms provide will be discussed later.

Also shown is the broad division of elements into METALS (                       ), NON-METALS (            ) and METALLOIDS (      ).Unit 3.indd   8311/2/2022   4:28:19 PM84reactive metals with low ionization enthalpies. They lose the outermost electron(s) readily to \nform 1+ ion (in the case of alkali metals) or 2+ \nion (in the case of alkaline earth metals). The \nmetallic character and the reactivity increase \nas we go down the group. Because of high \nreactivity they are never found pure in nature. \nThe compounds of the s-block elements, with the exception of those of lithium and beryllium \nare predominantly ionic.3.6.2 The p-Block ElementsThe p-Block Elements comprise those belonging to Group 13 to 18 and these together with the s-Block Elements are \ncalled the Representative Elements or Main \nGroup Elements. The outermost electronic �configuration varies from ns2np1 to ns2np6 in each period. At the end of each period is \na noble gas element with a closed valence \nshell ns2np6 configuration. All the orbitals in the valence shell of the noble gases are �completely filled by electrons and it is very �difficult to alter this stable arrangement by \nthe addition or removal of electrons. The \nnoble gases thus exhibit very low chemical \nreactivity. Preceding the noble gas family \nare two chemically important groups of non-\nmetals. They are the halogens (Group 17) and \nthe chalcogens (Group 16). These two groups of elements have highly negative electron \ngain enthalpies and readily add one or two \nelectrons respectively to attain the stable �noble gas configuration. The non-metallic \ncharacter increases as we move from left to \nright across a period and metallic character \nincreases as we go down the group.3.6.3 The d-Block Elements (Transition   Elements)These are the elements of Group 3 to 12 in the centre of the Periodic Table. These are �characterised by the filling of inner d orbitals by electrons and are therefore referred to as  d-Block Elements. These elements have \nthe general outer electronic configuration  (n-1)d1-10ns0-2 except for Pd where its electronic configuration is 4d105s0.. They are all metals. They mostly form coloured ions, exhibit variable valence (oxidation states), paramagnetism and oftenly used as catalysts. However, Zn, Cd and Hg which have the electronic configuration, \n(n-1) d10ns2 do not show most of the properties of transition elements. In a way, transition \nmetals form a bridge between the chemically \nactive metals of s-block elements and the \nless active elements of Groups 13 and 14 and \nthus take their familiar name “Transition \nElements”.3.6.4 The f-Block Elements   (Inner-Transition Elements)The two rows of elements at the bottom of the Periodic Table, called the Lanthanoids,  \nCe(Z = 58) – Lu(Z = 71) and Actinoids,  Th(Z = 90) – Lr (Z = 103) are characterised by the outer electronic configuration (n-2)f1-14 (n-1)d0–1ns2. The last electron added to each element is filled in f- orbital. These two series of elements are hence called the Inner-\nTransition Elements (f-Block Elements). They are all metals. Within each series, the \nproperties of the elements are quite similar. \nThe chemistry of the early actinoids is \nmore complicated than the corresponding \nlanthanoids, due to the large number of \noxidation states possible for these actinoid \nelements. Actinoid elements are radioactive. \nMany of the actinoid elements have been made \nonly in nanogram quantities or even less by \nnuclear reactions and their chemistry is not \nfully studied. The elements after uranium are called Transuranium Elements.Problem 3.3The elements  Z = 117 and 120 have not yet been discovered. In which family/group would you place these elements and also give the electronic configuration in \neach case.SolutionWe see from Fig. 3.2, that element with Z = 117, would belong to the halogen family (Group 17) and the �electronic configuration would be [Rn] \n5f146d107s27p5.

The elements can be divided into Metals and Non-Metals. Metals comprise more than 78% of all known elements and appear on \nthe left side of the Periodic Table. Metals are usually solids at room temperature [mercury is an exception; gallium and caesium also \nhave very low melting points (303K and \n302K, respectively)]. Metals usually have high \nmelting and boiling points. They are good \nconductors of heat and electricity. They are �malleable\t(can\tbe\tflattened\tinto\tthin\tsheets\tby\thammering) and ductile (can be drawn into wires). In contrast, non-metals are located at \nthe top right hand side of the Periodic Table. In fact, in a horizontal row, the property of elements change from metallic on the left to \nnon-metallic on the right. Non-metals are \nusually solids or gases at room temperature \nwith low melting and boiling points (boron \nand carbon are exceptions). They are poor \nconductors of heat and electricity. Most non-\nmetallic solids are brittle and are neither \nmalleable nor ductile. The elements become \nmore metallic as we go down a group; the \nnon-metallic character increases as one goes \nfrom left to right across the Periodic Table. The change from metallic to non-metallic \ncharacter is not abrupt as shown by the thick zig-zag\tline\tin\tFig.\t3.3.\tThe\telements\t(e.g.,\tsilicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and \ntellurium) bordering this line and running \ndiagonally across the Periodic Table show properties that are characteristic of both metals and non-metals. These elements are \ncalled Semi-metals or Metalloids.Problem 3.4Considering the atomic number and position in the periodic table, arrange \nthe following elements in the increasing �order\tof\tmetallic\tcharacter\t:\tSi,\tBe,\tMg,\tNa, P.SolutionMetallic character increases down a group and decreases along a period as \nwe move from left to right. Hence the \norder of increasing metallic character �is:\tP\t\u003c\tSi\t\u003c\tBe\t\u003c\tMg\t\u003c\tNa.3.7 PERIODIC TRENDS IN PROPERTIES OF ELEMENTSThere are many observable patterns in the physical and chemical properties of elements as we descend in a group or move across a �period\tin\tthe\tPeriodic\tTable.\tFor\texample,\twithin a period, chemical reactivity tends to \nbe high in Group 1 metals, lower in elements \ntowards the middle of the table, and increases \nto a maximum in the Group 17 non-metals. \nLikewise within a group of representative metals (say alkali metals) reactivity increases \non moving down the group, whereas within a \ngroup of non-metals (say halogens), reactivity \ndecreases down the group. But why do the \nproperties of elements follow these trends? \nAnd how can we explain periodicity? To \nanswer these questions, we must look into the \ntheories of atomic structure and properties \nof the atom. In this section we shall discuss \nthe periodic trends in certain physical and \nchemical properties and try to explain them \nin terms of number of electrons and energy \nlevels.3.7.1 Trends in Physical PropertiesThere are numerous physical properties of elements such as melting and boiling points, heats of fusion and vaporization, energy \nof atomization, etc. which show periodic \nvariations. However, we shall discuss the \nperiodic trends with respect to atomic and \nionic radii, ionization enthalpy, electron gain \nenthalpy and electronegativity.(a) Atomic RadiusYou\tcan\tvery\twell\timagine\tthat\tfinding\tthe\tsize of an atom is a lot more complicated than measuring the radius of a ball. Do you know �why?\tFirstly,\tbecause\tthe\tsize\tof\tan\tatom\t (~ 1.2 Å i.e., 1.2 × 10–10 m in radius) is very Unit 3.indd   859/9/2022   4:36:14 PM86small. Secondly, since the electron cloud surrounding the atom does not have a sharp \nboundary, the determination of the atomic \nsize cannot be precise. In other words, there is no practical way by which the size of an \nindividual atom can be measured. However, \nan estimate of the atomic size can be made by \nknowing the distance between the atoms in \nthe combined state. One practical approach to \nestimate the size of an atom of a non-metallic \nelement is to measure the distance between \ntwo atoms when they are bound together \nby a single bond in a covalent molecule and \nfrom this value, the “Covalent Radius” of the element\tcan\tbe\tcalculated.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tbond distance in the chlorine molecule (Cl2) is 198 pm and half this distance (99 pm), is �taken\tas\tthe\tatomic\tradius\tof\tchlorine.\tFor\tmetals,\twe\tdefine\tthe\tterm\t“Metallic Radius” which is taken as half the internuclear \ndistance separating the metal cores in the metallic\tcrystal.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tdistance\tbetween two adjacent copper atoms in solid \ncopper is 256 pm; hence the metallic radius �of\tcopper\tis\tassigned\ta\tvalue\tof\t128\tpm.\tFor\tsimplicity, in this book, we use the term Atomic Radius to refer to both covalent or metallic radius depending on whether the \nelement is a non-metal or a metal. Atomic \nradii can be measured by X-ray or other spectroscopic methods. The atomic radii of a few elements are listed in Table 3.6. Two trends are obvious. We can explain these trends in terms of nuclear charge \nand energy level. The atomic size generally \ndecreases across a period as illustrated in  Fig.\t3.4(a)\tfor\tthe\telements\tof\tthe\tsecond\tperiod. It is because within the period the \nouter electrons are in the same valence shell \nand the effective nuclear charge increases as the atomic number increases resulting in \nthe increased attraction of electrons to the \nnucleus. Within a family or vertical column \nof the periodic table, the atomic radius increases regularly with atomic number as �illustrated\tin\tFig.\t3.4(b).\tFor\talkali\tmetals\tand halogens, as we descend the groups, \nthe principal quantum number (n) increases and the valence electrons are farther from \nthe nucleus. This happens because the inner �energy\tlevels\tare\tfilled\twith\telectrons,\twhich\tserve to shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus. Consequently the size of �the\tatom\tincreases\tas\treflected\tin\tthe\tatomic\tradii.Note that the atomic radii of noble gases are not considered here. Being monoatomic, \ntheir (non-bonded radii) values are very \nlarge. In fact radii of noble gases should be \ncompared not with the covalent radii but with \nthe van der Waals radii of other elements.Table 3.6(a)  Atomic Radii/pm Across the PeriodsAtom (Period II)LiBeBCNOFAtomic radius1521118877746664Atom (Period III)NaMgAlSiPSClAtomic radius18616014311711010499 Table 3.6(b)  Atomic Radii/pm Down a FamilyAtom  (Group I)Atomic  RadiusAtom  (Group 17)Atomic  RadiusLi152F64Na186Cl99K231Br114Rb244I133Cs262At140Unit 3.indd   869/9/2022   4:36:14 PM87(b) Ionic RadiusThe removal of an electron from an atom results in the formation of a cation, whereas \ngain of an electron leads to an anion. The \nionic radii can be estimated by measuring \nthe distances between cations and anions \nin ionic crystals. In general, the ionic radii \nof elements exhibit the same trend as the \natomic radii. A cation is smaller than its \nparent atom because it has fewer electrons \nwhile its nuclear charge remains the same. \nThe size of an anion will be larger than that of \nthe parent atom because the addition of one \nor more electrons would result in increased \nrepulsion among the electrons and a decrease �in\teffective\tnuclear\tcharge.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tionic\tradius\tof\tfluoride\tion\t(F–) is 136 pm whereas\tthe\tatomic\tradius\tof\tfluorine\tis\tonly\t64 pm. On the other hand, the atomic radius \nof sodium is 186 pm compared to the ionic \nradius of 95 pm for Na+.When\twe\tfind\tsome\tatoms\tand\tions\twhich\tcontain the same number of electrons, we call \nthem isoelectronic species*.\tFor\texample,\t O2–,\tF–, Na+ and Mg2+ have the same number of electrons (10). Their radii would be different \nbecause of their different nuclear charges. The Fig. 3.4 (a)  Variation of atomic radius with atomic number across the second periodFig. 3.4 (b) Variation of atomic radius with \natomic number for alkali metals and \nhalogenscation with the greater positive charge will \nhave a smaller radius because of the greater attraction of the electrons to the nucleus. \nAnion with the greater negative charge will \nhave the larger radius. In this case, the net \nrepulsion of the electrons will outweigh the \nnuclear charge and the ion will expand in size.Problem 3.5Which of the following species will have the largest and the smallest size?\nMg, Mg2+, Al, Al3+.SolutionAtomic radii decrease across a period. \nCations are smaller than their parent atoms. Among isoelectronic species, \nthe one with the larger positive nuclear \ncharge will have a smaller radius.Hence the largest species is Mg; the smallest one is Al3+.(c) Ionization EnthalpyA quantitative measure of the tendency of an element to lose electron is given by its Ionization Enthalpy. It represents the energy required to remove an electron from an \nisolated gaseous atom (X) in its ground state. *  Two or more species with same number of atoms, same number of valence electrons and same structure, regardless of the nature of elements involved.Unit 3.indd   879/9/2022   4:36:14 PM88In\tother\twords,\tthe\tfirst\tionization enthalpy for an element X is the enthalpy change  (∆i H) for the reaction depicted in equation 3.1.X(g) → X+(g) + e–           (3.1)The ionization enthalpy is expressed in units of kJ mol–1.\tWe\tcan\tdefine\tthe\tsecond\tionization enthalpy as the energy required to remove the second most loosely bound electron; it is the energy required to carry out \nthe reaction shown in equation 3.2.\nX+(g) → X2+(g) + e–           (3.2)Energy is always required to remove electrons from an atom and hence ionization \nenthalpies are always positive. The second \nionization enthalpy will be higher than the �first\tionization\tenthalpy\tbecause\tit\tis\tmore\tdifficult\tto\tremove\tan\telectron\tfrom\ta\tpositively\tcharged ion than from a neutral atom. In the \nsame way the third ionization enthalpy will be \nhigher than the second and so on. The term �“ionization\tenthalpy”,\tif\tnot\tqualified,\tis\ttaken\tas\tthe\tfirst\tionization\tenthalpy.The\tfirst\tionization\tenthalpies\tof\telements\thaving atomic numbers up to 60 are plotted �in\tFig.\t3.5.\tThe\tperiodicity\tof\tthe\tgraph\tis\tquite\tstriking.\tYou\twill\tfind\tmaxima\tat\tthe\tnoble gases which have closed electron shells �and\tvery\tstable\telectron\tconfigurations.\tOn\tthe other hand, minima occur at the alkali \nmetals and their low ionization enthalpies Fig. 3.5  Variation of first ionization enthalpies \n(∆iH) with atomic number for elements with Z = 1 to 60can be correlated with their high reactivity. \nIn addition, you will notice two trends the �first\tionization\tenthalpy\tgenerally\tincreases\tas we go across a period and decreases \nas we descend in a group. These trends are\tillustrated\tin\tFigs.\t3.6(a)\tand\t3.6(b)\trespectively for the elements of the second �period\tand\tthe\tfirst\tgroup\tof\tthe\tperiodic\ttable. You will appreciate that the ionization \nenthalpy and atomic radius are closely related properties. To understand these trends, we �have\tto\tconsider\ttwo\tfactors\t:\t(i)\tthe\tattraction\tof electrons towards the nucleus, and (ii) the \nrepulsion of electrons from each other. The effective nuclear charge experienced by a Fig. 3.6(a) First ionization enthalpies (∆iH) of elements of the second period as a  function of atomic number (Z) and Fig. 3.6(b) ∆iH of alkali metals as a function of Z. 3.6 (a)3.6 (b)Unit 3.indd   889/9/2022   4:36:14 PM89valence electron in an atom will be less than the actual charge on the nucleus because of \n“shielding” or “screening” of the valence \nelectron from the nucleus by the intervening �core\telectrons.\tFor\texample,\tthe\t2s electron in lithium is shielded from the nucleus by \nthe inner core of 1s electrons. As a result, the valence electron experiences a net positive \ncharge which is  less than the actual charge \nof +3. In general, shielding is effective when \nthe orbitals in the inner shells are completely �filled.\tThis\tsituation\toccurs\tin\tthe\tcase\tof\talkali metals which have single outermost \nns-electron preceded by a noble gas electronic configuration.When\twe\tmove\tfrom\tlithium\tto\tfluorine\tacross the second period, successive electrons are added to orbitals in the same principal \nquantum level and the shielding of the nuclear charge by the inner core of electrons does \nnot increase very much to compensate for \nthe increased attraction of the electron to the \nnucleus. Thus, across a period, increasing \nnuclear charge outweighs the shielding. \nConsequently, the outermost electrons are \nheld more and more tightly and the ionization \nenthalpy increases across a period. As we go \ndown a group, the outermost electron being \nincreasingly farther from the nucleus, there is \nan increased shielding of the nuclear charge \nby the electrons in the inner levels. In this \ncase, increase in shielding outweighs the \nincreasing nuclear charge and the removal of \nthe outermost electron requires less energy \ndown a group.From\tFig.\t3.6(a),\tyou\twill\talso\tnotice\tthat\tthe\tfirst\tionization\tenthalpy\tof\tboron\t(Z = 5) is slightly less than that of beryllium (Z = 4) even though the former has a greater nuclear charge. When we consider the same principal \nquantum level, an s-electron is attracted to the nucleus more than a p-electron. In beryllium, the electron removed during the ionization is \nan s-electron whereas the electron removed during ionization of boron is a p-electron. The penetration of a 2s-electron to the nucleus is \nmore than that of a 2p-electron; hence the 2p \nelectron of boron is more shielded from the \nnucleus by the inner core of electrons than the 2s electrons of beryllium. Therefore, it is easier to remove the 2p-electron from boron \ncompared to the removal of a 2s- electron from beryllium.\tThus,\tboron\thas\ta\tsmaller\tfirst\tionization enthalpy than beryllium. Another \n“anomaly” is the smaller first ionization enthalpy of oxygen compared to nitrogen. This \narises because in the nitrogen atom, three \n2p-electrons reside in different atomic orbitals (Hund’s rule) whereas in the oxygen atom, \ntwo of the four 2p-electrons must occupy the \nsame 2p-orbital resulting in an increased \nelectron-electron repulsion. Consequently, \nit is easier to remove the fourth 2p-electron \nfrom oxygen than it is, to remove one of the \nthree 2p-electrons from nitrogen.Problem 3.6 The\tfirst\tionization\tenthalpy\t(∆i H ) values of the third period elements, Na, Mg and Si are respectively 496, 737 and 786 kJ  mol–1.\tPredict\twhether\tthe\tfirst\t∆i H value for Al will be more close to 575 or 760 kJ  mol–1 ? Justify your answer.Solution It will be more close to 575 kJ mol–1. The value for Al should be lower than \nthat of Mg because of effective shielding \nof 3p electrons from the nucleus by  3s-electrons.(d) Electron Gain Enthalpy When an electron is added to a neutral gaseous atom (X) to convert it into a negative \nion, the enthalpy change accompanying the \nprocess is defined as the Electron Gain \nEnthalpy (∆egH). Electron gain enthalpy provides a measure of the ease with which \nan atom adds an electron to form anion as \nrepresented by equation 3.3.X(g) + e–  →  X–(g)            (3.3)Depending on the element, the process of adding an electron to the atom can be either\tendothermic\tor\texothermic.\tFor\tmany\telements energy is released when an electron \nis added to the atom and the electron gain �enthalpy\tis\tnegative.\tFor\texample,\tgroup\t17 elements (the halogens) have very high Unit 3.indd   899/9/2022   4:36:15 PM90negative electron gain enthalpies because they can attain stable noble gas electronic �configurations\tby\tpicking\tup\tan\telectron.\tOn the other hand, noble gases have large positive electron gain enthalpies because the electron has to enter the next higher principal quantum level leading to a very unstable �electronic\tconfiguration.\tIt\tmay\tbe\tnoted\tthat\telectron gain enthalpies have large negative \nvalues toward the upper right of the periodic \ntable preceding the noble gases.The variation in electron gain enthalpies of elements is less systematic than for ionization \nenthalpies. As a general rule, electron gain \nenthalpy becomes more negative with increase in the atomic number across a period. The \neffective nuclear charge increases from left to \nright across a period and consequently it will \nbe easier to add an electron to a smaller atom \nsince the added electron on an average would \nbe closer to the positively charged nucleus. We \nshould also expect electron gain enthalpy to \nbecome less negative as we go down a group \nbecause the size of the atom increases and \nthe added electron would be farther from the \nnucleus. This is generally the case (Table \n3.7). However, electron gain enthalpy of O or �F\tis\tless\tnegative\tthan\tthat\tof\tthe\tsucceeding\telement. This is because when an electron is added\tto\tO\tor\tF,\tthe\tadded\telectron\tgoes\tto\tthe smaller n = 2 quantum level and suffers significant\trepulsion\tfrom\tthe\tother\telectrons\tpresent\tin\tthis\tlevel.\tFor\tthe\tn = 3 quantum level (S or Cl), the added electron occupies \na larger region of space and the electron-electron repulsion is much less.Problem 3.7Which of the following will have the most negative electron gain enthalpy and \nwhich the least negative?�P,\tS,\tCl,\tF.Explain your answer.SolutionElectron gain enthalpy generally \nbecomes more negative across a \nperiod as we move from left to right. Within a group, electron gain enthalpy \nbecomes less negative down a group. \nHowever, adding an electron to the \n2p-orbital leads to greater repulsion than adding an electron to the larger  3p-orbital. Hence the element with most negative electron gain enthalpy is \nchlorine; the one with the least negative \nelectron gain enthalpy is phosphorus.(e) ElectronegativityA qualitative measure of the ability of an atom in a chemical compound to attract shared \nelectrons to itself is called electronegativity. Unlike ionization enthalpy and electron gain \nenthalpy, it is not a measureable quantity. \nHowever, a number of numerical scales of \nelectronegativity of elements viz., Pauling \nscale, Mulliken-Jaffe scale, Allred-Rochow \nscale have been developed. The one which \nis the most widely used is the Pauling scale. \nLinus Pauling, an American scientist, in 1922 �assigned\tarbitrarily\ta\tvalue\tof\t4.0\tto\tfluorine,\tthe element considered to have the greatest * In many books, the negative of the enthalpy change for the process depicted in equation 3.3 is deﬁned as the ELECTRON AFFINITY (Ae ) of the atom under consideration. If energy is released when an electron is added to an atom, the electron afﬁnity is taken as positive, contrary to thermodynamic convention. If energy has to be supplied to add an electron to an \natom, then the electron afﬁnity of the atom is assigned a negative sign. However, electron afﬁnity is deﬁned as absolute \nzero and, therefore at any other temperature (T) heat capacities of the reactants and the products have to be taken into \naccount in ∆egH = Ae  5/2 RT.

Approximate values for the electronegativity of a few \nelements are given in Table 3.8(a)The electronegativity of any given element is not constant; it varies depending on the \nelement to which it is bound. Though it is \nnot a measurable quantity, it does provide a \nmeans of predicting the nature of force that \nholds a pair of atoms together – a relationship \nthat you will explore later.Electronegativity generally increases across a period from \nleft to right (say from lithium to �fluorine)\tand\tdecrease\tdown\ta\tgroup\t(say\tfrom\tfluorine\tto\tastatine)\tin the periodic table. How can \nthese trends be explained? \nCan the electronegativity be \nrelated to atomic radii, which tend to decrease across each \nperiod from left to right, but \nincrease down each group ? The \nattraction between the outer \n(or valence) electrons and the \nnucleus increases as the atomic \nradius decreases in a period. The \nelectronegativity also increases. On the same account electronegativity values \ndecrease with the increase in atomic radii \ndown a group. The trend is similar to that of \nionization enthalpy.Knowing the relationship between electronegativity and atomic radius, can \nyou now visualise the relationship between \nelectronegativity and non-metallic properties? \nNon-metallic  elements have strong tendency Fig. 3.7  The periodic trends of elements in the periodic tableTable 3.8(a)  Electronegativity Values (on Pauling scale) Across the PeriodsAtom (Period II)LiBeBCNOFElectronegativity1.01.52.02.53.03.54.0Atom (Period III)NaMgAlSiPSClElectronegativity0.91.21.51.82.12.53.0Table 3.8(b)  Electronegativity Values (on Pauling scale) Down a FamilyAtom  (Group I)Electronegativity ValueAtom  (Group 17)Electronegativity ValueLi1.0F4.0Na0.9Cl3.0K0.8Br2.8Rb0.8I2.5Cs0.7At2.2Unit 3.indd   919/9/2022   4:36:15 PM92to gain electrons. Therefore, electronegativity is directly related to that non-metallic properties \nof elements. It can be further extended to say \nthat the electronegativity is inversely related \nto the metallic properties of elements. Thus, \nthe increase in electronegativities across \na period is accompanied by an increase \nin non-metallic properties (or decrease in \nmetallic properties) of elements. Similarly, the \ndecrease in electronegativity down a group is \naccompanied by a decrease in non-metallic \nproperties (or increase in metallic properties) \nof elements.All these periodic trends are summarised in\tFigure\t3.7.3.7.2 Periodic Trends in Chemical    PropertiesMost of the trends in chemical properties of elements, such as diagonal relationships, inert \npair effect, effects of lanthanoid contraction \netc. will be dealt with along the discussion \nof each group in later units. In this section \nwe shall study the periodicity of the valence \nstate shown by elements and the anomalous \nproperties of the second period elements (from �lithium\tto\tfluorine).(a) Periodicity of Valence or Oxidation       StatesThe valence is the most characteristic property of the elements and can be understood in terms\tof\ttheir\telectronic\tconfigurations.\t\tThe\tvalence of representative elements is usually (though not necessarily) equal to the number \nof electrons in the outermost orbitals and/or \nequal to eight minus the number of outermost \nelectrons as shown below. Nowadays the term oxidation state is frequently used for valence. Consider the �two\toxygen\tcontaining\tcompounds:\tOF2 and Na2O. The order of electronegativity of the three elements involved in these compounds �is\tF\t\u003e\tO\t\u003e\tNa.\tEach\tof\tthe\tatoms\tof\tfluorine,\twith\touter\telectronic\tconfiguration\t2s22p5, shares\tone\telectron\twith\toxygen\tin\tthe\tOF2 molecule. Being highest electronegative \nelement, fluorine is given oxidation state �–1.\tSince\tthere\tare\ttwo\tfluorine\tatoms\tin\tthis molecule, oxygen with outer electronic �configuration\t2s22p4 shares two electrons with fluorine atoms and thereby exhibits \noxidation state +2. In Na2O, oxygen being more electronegative accepts two electrons, \none from each of the two sodium atoms and, \nthus, shows oxidation state –2. On the other �hand\tsodium\twith\telectronic\tconfiguration\t3s1 loses one electron to oxygen and is given oxidation state +1. Thus, the oxidation state \nof an element in a particular compound can �be\tdefined\tas\tthe\tcharge\tacquired\tby\tits\tatom\ton the basis of electronegative consideration from other atoms in the molecule.Problem 3.8Using the Periodic Table, predict the formulas of compounds which might \nbe formed by the following pairs of \nelements; (a) silicon and bromine  (b) aluminium and sulphur.Solution(a) Silicon is group 14 element with \na valence of 4; bromine belongs to \nthe halogen family with a valence of 1. Hence the formula of the \ncompound formed would be SiBr4.(b) Aluminium belongs to group \n13 with a valence of 3; sulphur belongs to group 16 elements with \na valence of 2. Hence, the formula \nof the compound formed would be Al2S3.Some periodic trends observed in the valence of elements (hydrides and oxides) are shown in Table 3.9. Other such periodic \ntrends which occur in the chemical behaviour \nof the elements are discussed elsewhere in Group12131415161718Number of valence electron12345678alence12343,52,61,70,8Unit 3.indd   929/9/2022   4:36:15 PM93this book. There are many elements which exhibit variable valence. This is particularly \ncharacteristic of transition elements and \nactinoids, which we shall study later.(b) Anomalous Properties of Second        Period ElementsThe\tfirst\telement\tof\teach\tof\tthe\tgroups\t1\t(lithium) and 2 (beryllium) and groups 13-17 (boron\tto\tfluorine)\tdiffers\tin\tmany\trespects\tfrom the other members of their respective group.\tFor\texample,\tlithium\tunlike\tother\talkali metals, and beryllium unlike other \nalkaline earth metals, form compounds with \npronounced covalent character; the other \nmembers of these groups predominantly form ionic compounds.

What are the reasons for the different chemical\tbehaviour\tof\tthe\tfirst\tmember\tof\ta group of elements in the s- and p-blocks compared to that of the subsequent members \nin the same group?

As a consequence of this, the maximum covalency of the first member of each group is 4 (e.g., boron can only form BF4\u001f\u001e\u001d, whereas the other members of the groups can expand their valence shell to accommodate more than \nfour pairs of electrons e.g., aluminium AlF63\u001f\u001e\u001d forms).\tFurthermore,\tthe\tfirst\tmember of p-block elements displays greater ability to form pπ – pπ  multiple bonds to itself (e.g., C = C, C ≡ C,   N = N, N ≡\tΝ) and to other second period elements (e.g., C = O, C = N, C ≡ N,  N = O) compared to subsequent members of the same group.Unit 3.indd   939/9/2022   4:36:15 PM94Problem 3.9Are the oxidation state and covalency of Al in [AlCl(H2O)5]2+ same ?SolutionNo. The oxidation state of Al is +3 and \nthe covalency is 6.3.7.3 Periodic Trends and Chemical   ReactivityWe have observed the periodic trends in certain fundamental properties such as atomic and ionic radii, ionization enthalpy, \nelectron gain enthalpy and valence. We \nknow by now that the periodicity is related to �electronic\tconfiguration.\tThat\tis,\tall\tchemical\tand physical properties are a manifestation of the\telectronic\tconfiguration\tof\telements.\tWe\tshall now try to explore relationships between \nthese fundamental properties of elements with \ntheir chemical reactivity.The atomic and ionic radii, as we know, generally decrease in a period from left to right. As a consequence, the ionization enthalpies \ngenerally increase (with some exceptions as \noutlined in section 3.7.1(a)) and electron gain \nenthalpies become more negative across a \nperiod. In other words, the ionization enthalpy \nof the extreme left element in a period is the \nleast and the electron gain enthalpy of the \nelement on the extreme right is the highest �negative\t(note\t:\tnoble\tgases\thaving\tcompletely\tfilled shells have rather positive electron \ngain enthalpy values). This results into high chemical reactivity at the two extremes and \nthe lowest in the centre. Thus, the maximum \nchemical reactivity at the extreme left (among \nalkali metals) is exhibited by the loss of an \nelectron leading to the formation of a cation \nand at the extreme right (among halogens) \nshown by the gain of an electron forming \nan anion. This property can be related with \nthe reducing and oxidizing behaviour of the \nelements which you will learn later. However, here it can be directly related to the metallic and non-metallic character of elements. Thus, \nthe metallic character of an element, which \nis highest at the extremely left decreases and \nthe non-metallic character increases while \nmoving from left to right across the period. \nThe chemical reactivity of an element can be \nbest shown by its reactions with oxygen and \nhalogens. Here, we shall consider the reaction \nof the elements with oxygen only. Elements \non two extremes of a period easily combine \nwith oxygen to form oxides. The normal oxide \nformed by the element on extreme left is the \nmost basic (e.g., Na2O), whereas that formed by the element on extreme right is the most \nacidic (e.g., Cl2O7). Oxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric (e.g., Al2O3, As2O3) or neutral (e.g., CO, NO, N2O). Amphoteric oxides behave as acidic with bases and as basic with \nacids, whereas neutral oxides have no acidic \nor basic properties.Problem 3.10Show by a chemical reaction with water that Na2O is a basic oxide and Cl2O7 is an acidic oxide.SolutionNa2O with water forms a strong base whereas Cl2O7 forms strong acid.Na2O + H2O → 2NaOHCl2O7 + H2O → 2HClO4Their basic or acidic nature can be qualitatively tested with litmus paper.Among transition metals (3d series), the change in atomic radii is much smaller as compared to those of representative elements \nacross the period. The change in atomic radii \nis still smaller among inner-transition metals  (4f series). The ionization enthalpies are intermediate between those of s- and p-blocks. \nAs a consequence, they are less electropositive \nthan group 1 and 2 metals.Unit 3.indd   949/9/2022   4:36:15 PM95In a group, the increase in atomic and ionic radii with increase in atomic number generally results in a gradual decrease in \nionization enthalpies and a regular decrease \n(with exception in some third period elements \nas shown in section 3.7.1(d)) in electron gain enthalpies in the case of main group elements. Thus, the metallic character increases down the group and non-metallic \ncharacter decreases. This trend can be related \nwith their reducing and oxidizing property \nwhich you will learn later. In the case of \ntransition elements, however, a reverse trend \nis observed. This can be explained in terms of \natomic size and ionization enthalpy.SUMMARYIn this Unit, you have studied the development of the Periodic Law and the Periodic Table. Mendeleev’s Periodic Table was based on atomic masses. Modern Periodic Table arranges the elements in the order of their atomic numbers in seven horizontal rows (periods) and eighteen vertical columns (groups or families). Atomic numbers in a period are consecutive, whereas in a group they increase in a pattern. Elements of the same group have similar \nvalence shell\telectronic\tconfiguration\tand,\ttherefore,\texhibit\tsimilar\tchemical\tproperties.\tHowever, the elements of the same period have incrementally increasing number of electrons �from\tleft\tto\tright,\tand,\ttherefore,\thave\tdifferent\tvalencies.\tFour\ttypes\tof\telements\tcan\tbe\trecognized\tin\tthe\tperiodic\ttable\ton\tthe\tbasis\tof\ttheir\telectronic\tconfigurations.\tThese\tare\ts-block, p-block, d-block and f-block elements. Hydrogen with one electron in the 1s orbital occupies a unique position in the periodic table. Metals comprise more than seventy eight per cent of the known elements. Non-metals, which are located at the top of the periodic table, are less than twenty in number. Elements which lie at the border line between metals and non-metals (e.g., Si, Ge, As) are called metalloids or semi-metals. Metallic character \nincreases with increasing atomic number in a group whereas decreases from left to right \nin a period. The physical and chemical properties of elements vary periodically with their \natomic numbers. Periodic trends are observed in atomic sizes, ionization enthalpies, electron gain enthalpies, electronegativity and valence. The atomic radii decrease while going from left to right in a period and increase with atomic number in a group. Ionization enthalpies generally increase across a period and decrease down a group. Electronegativity also shows \na similar trend. Electron gain enthalpies, in general, become more negative across a period \nand less negative down a group. There is some periodicity in valence, for example, among \nrepresentative elements, the valence is either equal to the number of electrons in the \noutermost orbitals or eight minus this number. Chemical reactivity is highest at the two \nextremes of a period and is lowest in the centre. The reactivity on the left extreme of a period \nis because of the ease of electron loss (or low ionization enthalpy). Highly reactive elements \ndo not occur in nature in free state; they usually occur in the combined form. Oxides formed \nof the elements on the left are basic and of the elements on the right are acidic in nature. \nOxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric or neutral.Unit 3.indd   959/9/2022   4:36:15 PM96EXERCISES3.1 What is the basic theme of organisation in the periodic table?3.2 Which important property did Mendeleev use to classify the elements in his periodic table and did he stick to that?3.3 What is the basic difference in approach between the Mendeleev’s Periodic Law and \nthe Modern Periodic Law?3.4 On the basis of quantum numbers, justify that the sixth period of the periodic table \nshould have 32 elements.3.5 In terms of period and group where would you locate the element with Z =114?3.6 Write the atomic number of the element present in the third period and seventeenth group of the periodic table.3.7 Which element do you think would have been named by (i) Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (ii) Seaborg’s group?3.8 Why do elements in the same group have similar physical and chemical properties?3.9 What does atomic radius and ionic radius really mean to you?3.10 How do atomic radius vary in a period and in a group?

In the case of sodium and \nchlorine, this can happen by the transfer of \nan electron from sodium to chlorine thereby �giving\tthe\tNa+ and Cl– ions. In the case of other molecules like Cl2,\tH2, F2, etc., the bond is formed by the sharing of a pair of electrons \nbetween the atoms. In the process each atom \nattains a stable outer octet of electrons.Lewis Symbols: In the formation of a molecule, only the outer shell electrons take \npart in chemical combination and they are \nknown as valence electrons.\tThe\tinner\tshell\telectrons are well protected and are generally �not\tinvolved\tin\tthe\tcombination\tprocess. G.N.\tLewis,\tan\tAmerican\tchemist\tintroduced\tsimple\tnotations\tto\trepresent\tvalence\telectrons\tin\tan\tatom.\tThese\tnotations\tare\tcalled\tLewis symbols.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tLewis\tsymbols\tfor\tthe elements of second period are as under:Significance of Lewis Symbols :\tThe\tnumber of dots around the symbol represents the\tnumber\tof\tvalence\telectrons.\tThis\tnumber\tof\tvalence\telectrons\thelps\tto\tcalculate\tthe\tcommon or group valence of the element.

In the process both chlorine atoms attain the outer shell octet of �the\tnearest\tnoble\tgas\t(i.e.,\targon).\tThe dots represent electrons. Such structures are referred to as Lewis dot \nstructures.The\tLewis\tdot\tstructures\tcan\tbe\twritten\tfor\tother molecules also, in which the combining atoms\tmay\tbe\tidentical\tor\tdifferent.\tThe\timportant conditions being that:•\tEach\tbond\tis\tformed\tas\ta\tresult\tof\tsharing\tof an electron pair between the atoms.•\tEach\tcombining\tatom\tcontributes\tat\tleast\tone electron to the shared pair.•\tThe\tcombining\tatoms\tattain\tthe\touter-shell\tnoble\tgas\tconfigurations\tas\ta\tresult\tof the sharing of electrons.•\tThus\tin\twater\tand\tcarbon\ttetrachloride\tmolecules,\tformation\tof\tcovalent\tbonds\tcan be represented as:   or Cl – ClCovalent bond between two Cl atomsThus, when two atoms share one electron pair they are said to be joined by \na single covalent bond. In many compounds we\thave\tmultiple bonds\tbetween\tatoms.\tThe\tformation\tof\tmultiple\tbonds\tenvisages\tsharing\tof more than one electron pair between two \natoms.

Isoelectronic molecules and ions have identical bond orders; for example, F2 and O2 2– have bond order 1. N2, CO and NO+ have bond order 3.A general correlation useful for understanding the stablities of molecules  is that: with increase in bond order, \nbond enthalpy increases and bond length \ndecreases. 4.3.5 Resonance StructuresIt\tis\toften\tobserved\tthat\ta\tsingle\tLewis\tstructure\tis inadequate for the representation of a molecule\tin\tconformity\twith\tits\texperimentally\tdetermined\tparameters.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tozone, O3 molecule can be equally represented by the structures I and II shown below:In\tboth\tstructures\twe\thave\ta\tO–O\tsingle\tbond\tand\ta\tO=O\tdouble\tbond.\tThe\tnormal\t O–O\tand\tO=O\tbond\tlengths\tare\t148\tpm\tand\t121\tpm\trespectively.\tExperimentally\tdetermined\toxygen-oxygen\tbond\tlengths\tin\tthe O3\tmolecule\tare\tsame\t(128\tpm).\tThus\tthe\toxygen-oxygen\tbonds\tin\tthe\tO3 molecule are intermediate between a double and a single bond.\tObviously,\tthis\tcannot\tbe\trepresented\tby\teither\tof\tthe\ttwo\tLewis\tstructures\tshown\tabove.\tThe\tconcept\tof\tresonance\twas\tintroduced\tto\tdeal\twith\tthe\ttype\tof\tdifficulty\texperienced\tin the depiction of accurate structures of molecules like O3. According to the concept of resonance, whenever a single Lewis \nstructure cannot describe a molecule \naccurately, a number of structures with \nsimilar energy, positions of nuclei, bonding \nand non-bonding pairs of electrons are \ntaken as the canonical structures of the \nhybrid which describes the molecule \naccurately.\tThus\tfor\tO3, the two structures shown\tabove\tconstitute\tthe\tcanonical\tstructures or resonance structures and \ntheir hybrid i.e., the III structure represents \nthe structure of O3\tmore\taccurately.\tThis\tis\talso called resonance hybrid.\tResonance\tis\trepresented by a double headed arrow.Fig. 4.3 Resonance in the O3 molecule(structures I and II represent the two canonical forms while the structure III is the resonance hybrid)Unit 4.indd   1099/12/2022   9:36:11 AM110Some\tof\tthe\tother\texamples\tof\tresonance\tstructures\tare\tprovided\tby\tthe\tcarbonate ion and the carbon dioxide molecule.Problem 4.3 Explain\tthe\tstructure\tof\tCO32– ion in terms of resonance.SolutionThe\tsingle\tLewis\tstructure\tbased\ton\tthe presence of two single bonds and one double bond between carbon and\toxygen\tatoms\tis\tinadequate\tto\trepresent the molecule accurately as it \nrepresents unequal bonds.

Consider the hydrogen molecule consisting �of\ttwo\tatoms\tA\tand\tB.\tEach\thydrogen\tatom\tin the ground state has one electron in 1s �orbital.\tThe\tatomic\torbitals\tof\tthese\tatoms\tmay\tbe\trepresented\tby\tthe\twave\tfunctions\tψA and ψB. Mathematically, the formation of molecular orbitals may be described by the \nlinear combination of atomic orbitals that can \ntake place by addition and by subtraction of �wave\tfunctions\tof\tindividual\tatomic\torbitals\tas shown below :ψMO\t=\tψA + ψBTherefore,\tthe\ttwo\tmolecular\torbitals\t σ and σ* are formed as : σ   =  ψA + ψB σ*\t=\t ψA – ψBThe\tmolecular\torbital\tσ formed by the addition of atomic orbitals is called the bonding molecular orbital while the molecular orbital σ* formed by the subtraction of atomic orbital is called antibonding molecular orbital as depicted\tin\tFig.\t4.19.Fig.4.19 Formation of bonding (σ) and antibonding (σ*) molecular orbitals by the linear  combination of atomic orbitals ψA and ψB centered on two atoms A and B respectively.Qualitatively,\tthe\tformation\tof\tmolecular\torbitals can be understood in terms of the �constructive\tor\tdestructive\tinterference\tof\tthe\telectron\twaves\tof\tthe\tcombining\tatoms.\tIn\tthe\tformation of bonding molecular orbital, the �two\telectron\twaves\tof\tthe\tbonding\tatoms\treinforce\teach\tother\tdue\tto\tconstructive\tinterference while in the formation of σ*\t=\tψA – ψBψAψBσ  = ψA + ψBUnit 4.indd   1269/12/2022   9:36:17 AM127antibonding molecular orbital, the electron waves\tcancel\teach\tother\tdue\tto\tdestructive\tinterference. As a result, the electron density in \na bonding molecular orbital is located between \nthe nuclei of the bonded atoms because of �which\tthe\trepulsion\tbetween\tthe\tnuclei\tis\tvery\tless while in case of an antibonding molecular orbital, most of the electron density is located \naway from the space between the nuclei. �Infact,\tthere\tis\ta\tnodal\tplane\t(on\twhich\tthe\telectron\tdensity\tis\tzero)\tbetween\tthe\tnuclei\tand hence the repulsion between the nuclei is �high.\tElectrons\tplaced\tin\ta\tbonding\tmolecular\torbital tend to hold the nuclei together and �stabilise\ta\tmolecule.\tTherefore,\ta\tbonding\tmolecular orbital always possesses lower \nenergy than either of the atomic orbitals that �have\tcombined\tto\tform\tit.\tIn\tcontrast,\tthe\telectrons placed in the antibonding molecular �orbital\tdestabilise\tthe\tmolecule.\tThis\tis\tbecause the mutual repulsion of the electrons \nin this orbital is more than the attraction between the electrons and the nuclei, which \ncauses a net increase in energy.It may be noted that the energy of the antibonding\torbital\tis\traised\tabove\tthe\tenergy of the parent atomic orbitals that have\tcombined\tand\tthe\tenergy\tof\tthe\tbonding\torbital has been lowered than the parent orbitals.\tThe\ttotal\tenergy\tof\ttwo\tmolecular\torbitals,\thowever,\tremains\tthe\tsame\tas\tthat\tof two original atomic orbitals. 4.7.2 Conditions for the Combination of Atomic OrbitalsThe\tlinear\tcombination\tof\tatomic\torbitals\tto\tform molecular orbitals takes place only if the following\tconditions\tare\tsatisfied:1. The combining atomic orbitals must have the same or nearly the same energy. �This\tmeans\tthat\t1s orbital can combine with another 1s orbital but not with 2s orbital because the energy of 2s orbital is appreciably higher than that of 1s\torbital.\tThis\tis\tnot\ttrue\tif\tthe\tatoms\tare\tvery\tdifferent.2. The combining atomic orbitals must have the same symmetry about the molecular axis.\tBy\tconvention\tz-axis\tis\ttaken\tas\tthe\tmolecular\taxis.\tIt\tis\timportant\tto\tnote\tthat\tatomic\torbitals\thaving\tsame\tor\tnearly\tthe same energy will not combine if they do not\thave\tthe\tsame\tsymmetry.\tFor\texample,\t2pz orbital of one atom can combine with 2pz orbital of the other atom but not with the \n2px or 2py orbitals because of their different symmetries. 3. The combining atomic orbitals  must overlap to the maximum extent. Greater the\textent\tof\toverlap,\tthe\tgreater\twill\tbe\tthe\telectron-density\tbetween\tthe\tnuclei\tof\ta\tmolecular orbital.4.7.3 Types of Molecular OrbitalsMolecular orbitals of diatomic molecules are designated as σ\t(sigma),\tπ\t(pi),\tδ (delta),\tetc.In this nomenclature, the sigma () molecular orbitals are symmetrical around the bond-axis while pi () molecular orbitals are not symmetrical.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tlinear\tcombination of 1s orbitals centered on two nuclei produces two molecular orbitals which �are\tsymmetrical\taround\tthe\tbond-axis.\tSuch\tmolecular orbitals are of the σ type and are designated as σ1s and σ*1s\t[Fig.\t4.20(a),\tpage\t124].\tIf internuclear axis is taken to be in the z-direction, it can be seen that a linear \ncombination of 2pz- orbitals of two atoms also produces two sigma molecular orbitals \ndesignated as 2pz and *2pz.
