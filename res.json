    "input": "The Periodic Table is arguably the most important concept in chemistry, both in principle and in practice. It is the \neveryday support for students, it suggests new avenues \nof research to professionals, and it provides a succinct \norganization of the whole of chemistry. It is a remarkable \ndemonstration of the fact that the chemical elements are \nnot a random cluster of entities but instead display trends \nand lie together in families. An awareness of the Periodic \nTable is essential to anyone who wishes to disentangle \nthe world and see how it is built up from the fundamental \nbuilding blocks of the chemistry, the chemical elements. Glenn T. SeaborgUNIT 3CLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIESAfter studying this Unit, you will be able to •\tappreciate how the concept of grouping elements in accordance \nto their properties led to the \ndevelopment of Periodic Table.•\tunderstand  the Periodic Law; •\tunderstand\tthe\t\tsignificance\tof\tatomic number and electronic \nconfiguration as the basis for �periodic\tclassification;•\tname the elements with  Z \u003e100 according to IUPAC nomenclature; •\tclassify elements into s, p, d, f blocks and learn their main characteristics;•\trecognise the periodic trends in \nphysical and chemical properties \nof elements;•\tcompare the reactivity of elements \nand correlate it with their \noccurrence in nature;•\texplain the relationship  between \nionization enthalpy and metallic \ncharacter;•\tuse  scientific  vocabulary \nappropriately to communicate \nideas related to certain important \nproperties of atoms e.g., \natomic/ionic radii, ionization \nenthalpy, electron gain enthalpy, \nelectronegativity, valence of \nelements. In this Unit, we will study the historical development of the \nPeriodic Table as it stands today and the Modern Periodic �Law.\tWe\twill\talso\tlearn\thow\tthe\tperiodic\tclassification\tfollows as a logical consequence of the electronic configuration\tof\tatoms.\tFinally,\twe\tshall\texamine\tsome\tof\tthe periodic trends in the physical and chemical properties of the elements.3.1 WHY DO WE NEED TO CLASSIFY ELEMENTS ?We know by now that the elements are the basic units of all types of matter. In 1800, only 31 elements were known. By\t\t1865,\tthe\tnumber\tof\tidentified\telements\thad\tmore\tthan\tdoubled to 63. At present 114 elements are known. Of them, the recently discovered elements are man-made. \nEfforts to synthesise new elements are continuing. With �such\ta\tlarge\tnumber\tof\telements\tit\tis\tvery\tdifficult\tto\tstudy individually the chemistry of all these elements and their innumerable compounds individually. To ease out \nthis problem, scientists searched for a systematic way to \norganise their knowledge by classifying the elements. Not \nonly that it would rationalize known chemical facts about \nelements, but even predict new ones for undertaking \nfurther study. Unit 3.indd   749/9/2022   4:36:12 PM753.2 GENESIS OF PERIODIC CLASSIFICATIONClassification\tof\telements\tinto\tgroups\tand\tdevelopment of Periodic Law and Periodic Table are the consequences of systematising the knowledge gained by a number of \nscientists through their observations and \nexperiments. The German chemist, Johann �Dobereiner\tin\tearly\t1800’s\twas\tthe\tfirst\tto\tconsider the idea of trends among properties \nof elements. By 1829 he noted a similarity \namong the physical and chemical properties \nof several groups of three elements (Triads). In each case, he noticed that the middle  element  of each of the Triads had an atomic weight about half way between the atomic weights of the other two (Table 3.1). Also the properties \nof the middle element were in between those \nof the other two members. Since Dobereiner’s the periodic recurrence of properties. This \nalso did not attract much attention. The \nEnglish chemist, John Alexander Newlands \nin 1865 profounded the Law of Octaves. He arranged the elements in increasing order \nof their atomic weights and noted that every eighth element had properties similar to the �first\telement\t(Table\t3.2).\tThe\trelationship\twas\tjust like every eighth note that resembles the �first\tin\toctaves\tof\tmusic.\tNewlands’s\tLaw\tof\tOctaves seemed to be true only for elements \nup to calcium. Although his idea was not widely accepted at that time, he, for his work, \nwas later awarded Davy Medal in 1887 by the \nRoyal Society, London.The Periodic Law, as we know it today owes its development to the Russian chemist, \nDmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) and the \nGerman chemist, Lothar Meyer (1830-1895).

The next reported attempt to classify elements was made by a �French\tgeologist,\tA.E.B.\tde\tChancourtois\tin\t1862. He arranged the then known elements \nin order of increasing atomic weights and \nmade a cylindrical table of elements to display Working independently, both the chemists in \n1869 proposed that on arranging elements in  the increasing order of their atomic weights, \nsimilarities appear in physical and chemical \nproperties at regular intervals. Lothar Meyer \nplotted the physical properties such as \natomic volume, melting point and boiling \npoint against atomic weight and obtained Unit 3.indd   759/9/2022   4:36:12 PM76a periodically repeated pattern. Unlike Newlands, Lothar Meyer observed a change \nin length of that repeating pattern. By 1868, \nLothar Meyer had developed a table of the \nelements that closely resembles the Modern \nPeriodic Table. However, his work was not \npublished until after the work of Dmitri \nMendeleev, the scientist who is generally \ncredited with the development of the Modern \nPeriodic Table.While Dobereiner initiated the study of periodic relationship, it was Mendeleev who \nwas responsible for publishing the Periodic �Law\tfor\tthe\tfirst\ttime.\tIt\tstates\tas\tfollows\t:The properties of the elements are a periodic function of their atomic \nweights.Mendeleev arranged elements in horizontal \nrows and vertical columns of a table in order \nof their increasing atomic weights in such a \nway that the elements with similar properties \noccupied the same vertical column or group. \nMendeleev’s system of classifying elements \nwas more elaborate than that of Lothar �Meyer’s.\tHe\tfully\trecognized\tthe\tsignificance\tof periodicity and used broader range of physical and chemical properties to classify \nthe elements. In particular, Mendeleev relied \non the similarities in the empirical formulas \nand properties of the compounds formed by \nthe elements. He realized that some of the �elements\tdid\tnot\tfit\tin\twith\this\tscheme\tof\tclassification\tif\tthe\torder\tof\tatomic\tweight\twas strictly followed. He ignored the order of atomic weights, thinking that the atomic measurements might be incorrect, and placed \nthe elements with similar properties together. �For\texample,\tiodine\twith\tlower\tatomic\tweight\tthan that of tellurium (Group VI) was placed in\tGroup\tVII\talong\twith\tfluorine,\tchlorine,\tbromine because of similarities in properties �(Fig.\t3.1).\tAt\tthe\tsame\ttime,\tkeeping\this\tprimary aim of arranging the elements of similar properties in the same group, he \nproposed that some of the elements were \nstill undiscovered and, therefore, left several �gaps\tin\tthe\ttable.\tFor\texample,\tboth\tgallium\tand germanium were unknown at the time Mendeleev published his Periodic Table. He left the gap under aluminium and a gap \nunder silicon, and called these elements \nEka-Aluminium and Eka-Silicon. Mendeleev predicted not only the existence of gallium and germanium, but also described some of their \ngeneral physical properties.  These elements \nwere discovered later. Some of the properties \npredicted by Mendeleev for these elements \nand those found experimentally are listed in  Table 3.3. The boldness of Mendeleev’s quantitative predictions and their eventual success \nmade him and his Periodic Table famous. \nMendeleev’s Periodic Table published in 1905 �is\tshown\tin\tFig.\t3.1.Table 3.3 Mendeleev’s Predictions for the Elements Eka-aluminium (Gallium) and  Eka-silicon (Germanium)PropertyEka-aluminium (predicted)Gallium (found)Eka-silicon (predicted)Germanium (found)Atomic weight68707272.6Density/(g/cm3)5.95.945.55.36Melting point/KLow302.93High1231Formula of oxideE2O3Ga2O3EO2GeO2Formula of chlorideE Cl3GaCl3ECl4GeCl4Unit 3.indd   769/9/2022   4:36:12 PM77PERIODIC\tSYSTEM\tOF\tTHE\tELEMENTS\tIN\tGROUPS\tAND\tSERIESFig. 3.1  Mendeleev’s Periodic Table published earlierUnit 3.indd   779/9/2022   4:36:12 PM783.3 MODERN PERIODIC LAW AND THE PRESENT FORM OF THE PERIODIC TABLEWe must bear in mind that when Mendeleev developed his Periodic Table, chemists knew nothing about the internal structure of atom. However, the beginning of the 20th century witnessed profound developments \nin theories about sub-atomic particles. In 1913, the English physicist, Henry Moseley \nobserved regularities in the characteristic \nX-ray spectra of the elements. A plot of  (where \tis frequency of X-rays emitted) against atomic number (Z) gave a straight line and not the plot of  vs atomic mass. He thereby showed that the atomic number is a more fundamental property of an element \nthan its atomic mass. Mendeleev’s Periodic Law\twas,\ttherefore,\taccordingly\tmodified.\tThis\tis known as the Modern Periodic Law and can\tbe\tstated\tas\t:The physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic functions \nof their atomic numbers.The Periodic Law revealed important analogies among the 94 naturally occurring elements (neptunium and plutonium like \nactinium and protoactinium are also found \nin pitch blende – an ore of uranium). It \nstimulated renewed interest in Inorganic \nChemistry and has carried into the present \nwith the creation of artificially produced \nshort-lived elements.You may recall that the atomic number is equal to the nuclear charge (i.e., number of protons) or the number of electrons in \na neutral atom. It is then easy to visualize �the\tsignificance\tof\tquantum\tnumbers\tand\telectronic\tconfigurations\tin\tperiodicity\tof\telements. In fact, it is now recognized that the Periodic Law is essentially the consequence \nof the periodic variation in electronic �configurations,\twhich\tindeed\tdetermine\tthe\tphysical and chemical properties of elements and their compounds.Numerous forms of Periodic Table have been devised from time to time. Some forms emphasise chemical reactions and valence, whereas others stress the electronic �configuration\tof\telements.\tA\tmodern\tversion,\tthe so-called “long form” of the Periodic Table\tof\tthe\telements\t(Fig.\t3.2),\tis\tthe\tmost\tconvenient and widely used. The horizontal \nrows (which Mendeleev called series) are called periods and the vertical columns, groups. Elements having similar outer \nelectronic configurations in their atoms \nare arranged in vertical columns, referred \nto as groups or families. According to the recommendation of International Union of \nPure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the \ngroups are numbered from 1 to 18 replacing \nthe older notation of groups IA …  VIIA, VIII, \nIB …  VIIB and 0.There are altogether seven periods. The period number corresponds to the highest principal quantum number (n) of the elements in\tthe\tperiod.\tThe\tfirst\tperiod\tcontains\t2\telements. The subsequent periods consists of 8, 8, 18, 18 and 32 elements, respectively. The \nseventh period is incomplete and like the sixth \nperiod would have a theoretical maximum \n(on the basis of quantum numbers) of 32 \nelements. In this form of the Periodic Table, \n14 elements of both sixth and seventh periods \n(lanthanoids and actinoids, respectively) are \nplaced in separate panels at the bottom*.3.4 NOMENCLATURE OF ELEMENTS WITH ATOMIC NUMBERS \u003e 100The naming of the new elements had been traditionally the privilege of the discoverer \n(or discoverers) and the suggested name was �ratified\tby\tthe\tIUPAC.\tIn\trecent\tyears\tthis\thas\tled to some controversy. The new elements \nwith very high atomic numbers are so unstable that only minute quantities, sometimes only * Glenn T. Seaborgs work in the middle of the 20th century starting with the discovery of plutonium in 1940, followed by those of all the transuranium elements from 94 to 102 led to reconﬁguration of the periodic table placing the actinoids below the lanthanoids. In 1951, Seaborg was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work. Element 106 has been named \nSeaborgium (Sg) in his honour.Unit 3.indd   789/9/2022   4:36:13 PM79Fig. 3.2  Long form of the Periodic Table of the Elements with their atomic numbers and ground state outer electronic configurations. The groups are numbered 1-18 in accordance with the 1984 IUPAC recommendations. This notation replaces the old numbering scheme of  IA–VIIA, VIII, IB–VIIB and 0 for the elements.

Their synthesis and characterisation, therefore, \nrequire highly sophisticated costly equipment \nand laboratory. Such work is carried out with \ncompetitive spirit only in some laboratories \nin the world. Scientists, before collecting the \nreliable data on the new element, at times �get\ttempted\tto\tclaim\tfor\tits\tdiscovery.\tFor\texample, both American and Soviet scientists claimed credit for discovering element 104. The Americans named it Rutherfordium \nwhereas Soviets named it Kurchatovium. To \navoid such problems, the IUPAC has made \nrecommendation that until a new element’s �discovery\tis\tproved,\tand\tits\tname\tis\tofficially\trecognised, a systematic nomenclature be \nderived directly from the atomic number of the element using the numerical roots for \n0 and numbers 1-9. These are shown in  Table 3.4. The roots are put together in order of digits which make up the atomic number and “ium” is added at the end. The IUPAC names \nfor elements with Z above 100 are shown in  Table 3.5.Table 3.5  Nomenclature of Elements with Atomic Number Above 100AtomicNumberName according toIUPAC nomenclatureSymbolIUPACOfficial NameIUPACSymbol101102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n117\n118Unnilunium\nUnnilbium\nUnniltrium\nUnnilquadium\nUnnilpentium\nUnnilhexium\nUnnilseptium\nUnniloctium\nUnnilennium\nUnunnillium\nUnununnium\nUnunbium\nUnuntrium\nUnunquadium\nUnunpentium\nUnunhexium\nUnunseptium\nUnunoctiumUnuUnbUntUnqUnpUnhUnsUnoUneUunUuuUubUutUuqUupUuhUusUuoMendelevium\nNobelium\nLawrencium\nRutherfordium\nDubnium\nSeaborgium\nBohrium\nHassium\nMeitnerium\nDarmstadtium\nRontgenium\nCopernicium\nNihonium�Flerovium\nMoscovium\nLivermorium\nTennessine\nOganessonMdNoLr\nRfDbSgBhHsMtDsRgCn NhFlMcLvTsOgTable 3.4 Notation for IUPAC Nomenclature of ElementsDigitNameAbbreviation01\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9nilunbitriquadpenthexseptoctennnubtqphsoeUnit 3.indd   809/9/2022   4:36:13 PM81Thus, the new element first gets a temporary name, with symbol consisting of three letters.

Hence, \nthe symbol and the name respectively \nare Ubn and unbinilium.3.5 ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS OF ELEMENTS AND THE PERIODIC TABLEIn the preceding unit we have learnt that an electron in an atom is characterised by a set \nof four quantum numbers, and the principal \nquantum number (n\t)\tdefines\tthe\tmain\tenergy\tlevel known as shell. We have also studied about\tthe\tfilling\tof\telectrons\tinto\tdifferent\tsubshells, also referred to as orbitals (s, p, \nd, f) in an atom. The distribution of electrons into orbitals of an atom is called its electronic configuration. An element’s location in the �Periodic\tTable\treflects\tthe\tquantum\tnumbers\tof\tthe\tlast\torbital\tfilled.\tIn\tthis\tsection\twe\twill observe a direct connection between the �electronic\tconfigurations\tof\tthe\telements\tand\tthe long form of the Periodic Table.(a)  Electronic Configurations in PeriodsThe period indicates the value of n for the outermost or valence shell. In other words, successive period in the Periodic Table is �associated\twith\tthe\tfilling\tof\tthe\tnext\thigher\tprincipal energy level (n = 1, n = 2, etc.). It can be readily seen that the number of elements in each period is twice the number of atomic \norbitals available in the energy level that is �being\tfilled.\tThe\tfirst\tperiod\t(n = 1) starts with the\tfilling\tof\tthe\tlowest\tlevel\t(1s) and therefore has two elements — hydrogen (ls1) and helium (ls2)\twhen\tthe\tfirst\tshell\t(K) is completed. The second period (n = 2) starts with lithium and the third electron enters the 2s orbital. The next \nelement, beryllium has four electrons and has �the\telectronic\tconfiguration\t1s22s2. Starting from the next element boron, the 2p orbitals �are\tfilled\twith\telectrons\twhen\tthe\tL shell is completed at neon (2s22p6). Thus there are  8 elements in the second period. The third \nperiod (n = 3) begins at sodium, and the added electron enters a 3s\torbital.\tSuccessive\tfilling\tof 3s and 3p orbitals gives rise to the third period of 8 elements from sodium to argon. The \nfourth period (n = 4) starts at potassium, and �the\tadded\telectrons\tfill\tup\tthe\t4s orbital. Now you may note that before the 4p\torbital\tis\tfilled,\tfilling\tup\tof\t3d orbitals becomes energetically favourable and we come across the so called 3d transition series of elements. This starts from \nscandium (Z = 21) which has the electronic configuration\t3d14s2. The 3d\torbitals\tare\tfilled\tat zinc (Z=30)\twith\telectronic\tconfiguration\t 3d104s2. The fourth period ends at krypton with\tthe\tfilling\tup\tof\tthe\t4p orbitals. Altogether we have 18 elements in this fourth period. The fifth\tperiod\t(n = 5) beginning with rubidium is similar to the fourth period and contains \nthe 4d transition series starting at yttrium  (Z = 39). This period ends at xenon with the �filling\tup\tof\tthe\t5p orbitals. The sixth period  (n = 6) contains 32 elements and successive electrons enter 6s, 4f, 5d and 6p orbitals, in �the\torder\t—\tfilling\tup\tof\tthe\t4f orbitals begins with cerium (Z = 58) and ends at lutetium  (Z = 71) to give the 4f-inner transition series \nwhich is called the lanthanoid series. The \nseventh period (n = 7) is similar to the sixth �period\twith\tthe\tsuccessive\tfilling\tup\tof\tthe\t7s, 5f, 6d and 7p orbitals and includes most of the man-made radioactive elements. This \nperiod will end at the element with atomic \nnumber 118 which would belong to the noble gas family.\tFilling\tup\tof\tthe\t5f orbitals after Unit 3.indd   819/9/2022   4:36:13 PM82actinium (Z = 89) gives the 5f-inner transition series known as the actinoid series. The 4f- and 5f-inner transition series of elements \nare placed separately in the Periodic Table \nto maintain its structure and to preserve the �principle\tof\tclassification\tby\tkeeping\telements\twith similar properties in a single column.Problem 3.2How would you justify the presence of 18 elements in the 5th period of the Periodic Table?SolutionWhen n = 5, l = 0, 1, 2, 3. The order in which the energy of the available orbitals 4d, 5s and 5p increases is 5s \n\u003c 4d \u003c 5p. The total number of orbitals available are 9. The maximum number \nof electrons that can be accommodated \nis 18; and therefore 18 elements are there in the 5th period.(b) Groupwise Electronic ConfigurationsElements in the same vertical column or group have similar valence shell electronic �configurations,\tthe\tsame\tnumber\tof\telectrons\tin the outer orbitals, and similar properties. �For\texample,\tthe\tGroup\t1\telements\t(alkali\tmetals) all have ns1 valence shell electronic configuration\tas\tshown\tbelow.a theoretical foundation for the periodic classification.\tThe\telements\tin\ta\tvertical\tcolumn\tof the Periodic Table constitute a group or family and exhibit similar chemical behaviour. \nThis similarity arises because these elements \nhave the same number and same distribution \nof electrons in their outermost orbitals. We \ncan classify the elements into four blocks viz.,   \ns-block, p-block, d-block and f-block depending on the type of atomic orbitals that �are\tbeing\tfilled\twith\telectrons.\tThis\tis\tillustrated\tin\tFig.\t3.3.\tWe\tnotice\ttwo\texceptions\tto\tthis\tcategorisation. Strictly, helium belongs to the  s-block but its positioning in the p-block along with other group 18 elements is �justified\tbecause\tit\thas\ta\tcompletely\tfilled\tvalence shell (1s2) and as a result, exhibits properties characteristic of other noble gases. \nThe other exception is hydrogen. It has only \none s-electron and hence can be placed in  group 1 (alkali metals). It can also \ngain an electron to achieve a noble gas \narrangement and hence it can behave \nsimilar to a group 17 (halogen family) \nelements. Because it is a special case, we \nshall place hydrogen separately at the top of �the\tPeriodic\tTable\tas\tshown\tin\tFig.\t3.2\tand\t Fig.\t3.3.\tWe\twill\tbriefly\tdiscuss\tthe\tsalient\tfeatures of the four types of elements marked in the Periodic Table. More about these elements Thus it can be seen that the properties of an element have periodic dependence upon its atomic number and not on relative atomic mass.3.6 ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS AND TYPES OF ELEMENTS:  S-, P-, D-, F- BLOCKSThe aufbau (build up) principle and the electronic configuration of atoms provide will be discussed later.

Also shown is the broad division of elements into METALS (                       ), NON-METALS (            ) and METALLOIDS (      ).Unit 3.indd   8311/2/2022   4:28:19 PM84reactive metals with low ionization enthalpies. They lose the outermost electron(s) readily to \nform 1+ ion (in the case of alkali metals) or 2+ \nion (in the case of alkaline earth metals). The \nmetallic character and the reactivity increase \nas we go down the group. Because of high \nreactivity they are never found pure in nature. \nThe compounds of the s-block elements, with the exception of those of lithium and beryllium \nare predominantly ionic.3.6.2 The p-Block ElementsThe p-Block Elements comprise those belonging to Group 13 to 18 and these together with the s-Block Elements are \ncalled the Representative Elements or Main \nGroup Elements. The outermost electronic �configuration varies from ns2np1 to ns2np6 in each period. At the end of each period is \na noble gas element with a closed valence \nshell ns2np6 configuration. All the orbitals in the valence shell of the noble gases are �completely filled by electrons and it is very �difficult to alter this stable arrangement by \nthe addition or removal of electrons. The \nnoble gases thus exhibit very low chemical \nreactivity. Preceding the noble gas family \nare two chemically important groups of non-\nmetals. They are the halogens (Group 17) and \nthe chalcogens (Group 16). These two groups of elements have highly negative electron \ngain enthalpies and readily add one or two \nelectrons respectively to attain the stable �noble gas configuration. The non-metallic \ncharacter increases as we move from left to \nright across a period and metallic character \nincreases as we go down the group.3.6.3 The d-Block Elements (Transition   Elements)These are the elements of Group 3 to 12 in the centre of the Periodic Table. These are �characterised by the filling of inner d orbitals by electrons and are therefore referred to as  d-Block Elements. These elements have \nthe general outer electronic configuration  (n-1)d1-10ns0-2 except for Pd where its electronic configuration is 4d105s0.. They are all metals. They mostly form coloured ions, exhibit variable valence (oxidation states), paramagnetism and oftenly used as catalysts. However, Zn, Cd and Hg which have the electronic configuration, \n(n-1) d10ns2 do not show most of the properties of transition elements. In a way, transition \nmetals form a bridge between the chemically \nactive metals of s-block elements and the \nless active elements of Groups 13 and 14 and \nthus take their familiar name “Transition \nElements”.3.6.4 The f-Block Elements   (Inner-Transition Elements)The two rows of elements at the bottom of the Periodic Table, called the Lanthanoids,  \nCe(Z = 58) – Lu(Z = 71) and Actinoids,  Th(Z = 90) – Lr (Z = 103) are characterised by the outer electronic configuration (n-2)f1-14 (n-1)d0–1ns2. The last electron added to each element is filled in f- orbital. These two series of elements are hence called the Inner-\nTransition Elements (f-Block Elements). They are all metals. Within each series, the \nproperties of the elements are quite similar. \nThe chemistry of the early actinoids is \nmore complicated than the corresponding \nlanthanoids, due to the large number of \noxidation states possible for these actinoid \nelements. Actinoid elements are radioactive. \nMany of the actinoid elements have been made \nonly in nanogram quantities or even less by \nnuclear reactions and their chemistry is not \nfully studied. The elements after uranium are called Transuranium Elements.Problem 3.3The elements  Z = 117 and 120 have not yet been discovered. In which family/group would you place these elements and also give the electronic configuration in \neach case.SolutionWe see from Fig. 3.2, that element with Z = 117, would belong to the halogen family (Group 17) and the �electronic configuration would be [Rn] \n5f146d107s27p5.

The elements can be divided into Metals and Non-Metals. Metals comprise more than 78% of all known elements and appear on \nthe left side of the Periodic Table. Metals are usually solids at room temperature [mercury is an exception; gallium and caesium also \nhave very low melting points (303K and \n302K, respectively)]. Metals usually have high \nmelting and boiling points. They are good \nconductors of heat and electricity. They are �malleable\t(can\tbe\tflattened\tinto\tthin\tsheets\tby\thammering) and ductile (can be drawn into wires). In contrast, non-metals are located at \nthe top right hand side of the Periodic Table. In fact, in a horizontal row, the property of elements change from metallic on the left to \nnon-metallic on the right. Non-metals are \nusually solids or gases at room temperature \nwith low melting and boiling points (boron \nand carbon are exceptions). They are poor \nconductors of heat and electricity. Most non-\nmetallic solids are brittle and are neither \nmalleable nor ductile. The elements become \nmore metallic as we go down a group; the \nnon-metallic character increases as one goes \nfrom left to right across the Periodic Table. The change from metallic to non-metallic \ncharacter is not abrupt as shown by the thick zig-zag\tline\tin\tFig.\t3.3.\tThe\telements\t(e.g.,\tsilicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and \ntellurium) bordering this line and running \ndiagonally across the Periodic Table show properties that are characteristic of both metals and non-metals. These elements are \ncalled Semi-metals or Metalloids.Problem 3.4Considering the atomic number and position in the periodic table, arrange \nthe following elements in the increasing �order\tof\tmetallic\tcharacter\t:\tSi,\tBe,\tMg,\tNa, P.SolutionMetallic character increases down a group and decreases along a period as \nwe move from left to right. Hence the \norder of increasing metallic character �is:\tP\t\u003c\tSi\t\u003c\tBe\t\u003c\tMg\t\u003c\tNa.3.7 PERIODIC TRENDS IN PROPERTIES OF ELEMENTSThere are many observable patterns in the physical and chemical properties of elements as we descend in a group or move across a �period\tin\tthe\tPeriodic\tTable.\tFor\texample,\twithin a period, chemical reactivity tends to \nbe high in Group 1 metals, lower in elements \ntowards the middle of the table, and increases \nto a maximum in the Group 17 non-metals. \nLikewise within a group of representative metals (say alkali metals) reactivity increases \non moving down the group, whereas within a \ngroup of non-metals (say halogens), reactivity \ndecreases down the group. But why do the \nproperties of elements follow these trends? \nAnd how can we explain periodicity? To \nanswer these questions, we must look into the \ntheories of atomic structure and properties \nof the atom. In this section we shall discuss \nthe periodic trends in certain physical and \nchemical properties and try to explain them \nin terms of number of electrons and energy \nlevels.3.7.1 Trends in Physical PropertiesThere are numerous physical properties of elements such as melting and boiling points, heats of fusion and vaporization, energy \nof atomization, etc. which show periodic \nvariations. However, we shall discuss the \nperiodic trends with respect to atomic and \nionic radii, ionization enthalpy, electron gain \nenthalpy and electronegativity.(a) Atomic RadiusYou\tcan\tvery\twell\timagine\tthat\tfinding\tthe\tsize of an atom is a lot more complicated than measuring the radius of a ball. Do you know �why?\tFirstly,\tbecause\tthe\tsize\tof\tan\tatom\t (~ 1.2 Å i.e., 1.2 × 10–10 m in radius) is very Unit 3.indd   859/9/2022   4:36:14 PM86small. Secondly, since the electron cloud surrounding the atom does not have a sharp \nboundary, the determination of the atomic \nsize cannot be precise. In other words, there is no practical way by which the size of an \nindividual atom can be measured. However, \nan estimate of the atomic size can be made by \nknowing the distance between the atoms in \nthe combined state. One practical approach to \nestimate the size of an atom of a non-metallic \nelement is to measure the distance between \ntwo atoms when they are bound together \nby a single bond in a covalent molecule and \nfrom this value, the “Covalent Radius” of the element\tcan\tbe\tcalculated.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tbond distance in the chlorine molecule (Cl2) is 198 pm and half this distance (99 pm), is �taken\tas\tthe\tatomic\tradius\tof\tchlorine.\tFor\tmetals,\twe\tdefine\tthe\tterm\t“Metallic Radius” which is taken as half the internuclear \ndistance separating the metal cores in the metallic\tcrystal.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tdistance\tbetween two adjacent copper atoms in solid \ncopper is 256 pm; hence the metallic radius �of\tcopper\tis\tassigned\ta\tvalue\tof\t128\tpm.\tFor\tsimplicity, in this book, we use the term Atomic Radius to refer to both covalent or metallic radius depending on whether the \nelement is a non-metal or a metal. Atomic \nradii can be measured by X-ray or other spectroscopic methods. The atomic radii of a few elements are listed in Table 3.6. Two trends are obvious. We can explain these trends in terms of nuclear charge \nand energy level. The atomic size generally \ndecreases across a period as illustrated in  Fig.\t3.4(a)\tfor\tthe\telements\tof\tthe\tsecond\tperiod. It is because within the period the \nouter electrons are in the same valence shell \nand the effective nuclear charge increases as the atomic number increases resulting in \nthe increased attraction of electrons to the \nnucleus. Within a family or vertical column \nof the periodic table, the atomic radius increases regularly with atomic number as �illustrated\tin\tFig.\t3.4(b).\tFor\talkali\tmetals\tand halogens, as we descend the groups, \nthe principal quantum number (n) increases and the valence electrons are farther from \nthe nucleus. This happens because the inner �energy\tlevels\tare\tfilled\twith\telectrons,\twhich\tserve to shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus. Consequently the size of �the\tatom\tincreases\tas\treflected\tin\tthe\tatomic\tradii.Note that the atomic radii of noble gases are not considered here. Being monoatomic, \ntheir (non-bonded radii) values are very \nlarge. In fact radii of noble gases should be \ncompared not with the covalent radii but with \nthe van der Waals radii of other elements.Table 3.6(a)  Atomic Radii/pm Across the PeriodsAtom (Period II)LiBeBCNOFAtomic radius1521118877746664Atom (Period III)NaMgAlSiPSClAtomic radius18616014311711010499 Table 3.6(b)  Atomic Radii/pm Down a FamilyAtom  (Group I)Atomic  RadiusAtom  (Group 17)Atomic  RadiusLi152F64Na186Cl99K231Br114Rb244I133Cs262At140Unit 3.indd   869/9/2022   4:36:14 PM87(b) Ionic RadiusThe removal of an electron from an atom results in the formation of a cation, whereas \ngain of an electron leads to an anion. The \nionic radii can be estimated by measuring \nthe distances between cations and anions \nin ionic crystals. In general, the ionic radii \nof elements exhibit the same trend as the \natomic radii. A cation is smaller than its \nparent atom because it has fewer electrons \nwhile its nuclear charge remains the same. \nThe size of an anion will be larger than that of \nthe parent atom because the addition of one \nor more electrons would result in increased \nrepulsion among the electrons and a decrease �in\teffective\tnuclear\tcharge.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tionic\tradius\tof\tfluoride\tion\t(F–) is 136 pm whereas\tthe\tatomic\tradius\tof\tfluorine\tis\tonly\t64 pm. On the other hand, the atomic radius \nof sodium is 186 pm compared to the ionic \nradius of 95 pm for Na+.When\twe\tfind\tsome\tatoms\tand\tions\twhich\tcontain the same number of electrons, we call \nthem isoelectronic species*.\tFor\texample,\t O2–,\tF–, Na+ and Mg2+ have the same number of electrons (10). Their radii would be different \nbecause of their different nuclear charges. The Fig. 3.4 (a)  Variation of atomic radius with atomic number across the second periodFig. 3.4 (b) Variation of atomic radius with \natomic number for alkali metals and \nhalogenscation with the greater positive charge will \nhave a smaller radius because of the greater attraction of the electrons to the nucleus. \nAnion with the greater negative charge will \nhave the larger radius. In this case, the net \nrepulsion of the electrons will outweigh the \nnuclear charge and the ion will expand in size.Problem 3.5Which of the following species will have the largest and the smallest size?\nMg, Mg2+, Al, Al3+.SolutionAtomic radii decrease across a period. \nCations are smaller than their parent atoms. Among isoelectronic species, \nthe one with the larger positive nuclear \ncharge will have a smaller radius.Hence the largest species is Mg; the smallest one is Al3+.(c) Ionization EnthalpyA quantitative measure of the tendency of an element to lose electron is given by its Ionization Enthalpy. It represents the energy required to remove an electron from an \nisolated gaseous atom (X) in its ground state. *  Two or more species with same number of atoms, same number of valence electrons and same structure, regardless of the nature of elements involved.Unit 3.indd   879/9/2022   4:36:14 PM88In\tother\twords,\tthe\tfirst\tionization enthalpy for an element X is the enthalpy change  (∆i H) for the reaction depicted in equation 3.1.X(g) → X+(g) + e–           (3.1)The ionization enthalpy is expressed in units of kJ mol–1.\tWe\tcan\tdefine\tthe\tsecond\tionization enthalpy as the energy required to remove the second most loosely bound electron; it is the energy required to carry out \nthe reaction shown in equation 3.2.\nX+(g) → X2+(g) + e–           (3.2)Energy is always required to remove electrons from an atom and hence ionization \nenthalpies are always positive. The second \nionization enthalpy will be higher than the �first\tionization\tenthalpy\tbecause\tit\tis\tmore\tdifficult\tto\tremove\tan\telectron\tfrom\ta\tpositively\tcharged ion than from a neutral atom. In the \nsame way the third ionization enthalpy will be \nhigher than the second and so on. The term �“ionization\tenthalpy”,\tif\tnot\tqualified,\tis\ttaken\tas\tthe\tfirst\tionization\tenthalpy.The\tfirst\tionization\tenthalpies\tof\telements\thaving atomic numbers up to 60 are plotted �in\tFig.\t3.5.\tThe\tperiodicity\tof\tthe\tgraph\tis\tquite\tstriking.\tYou\twill\tfind\tmaxima\tat\tthe\tnoble gases which have closed electron shells �and\tvery\tstable\telectron\tconfigurations.\tOn\tthe other hand, minima occur at the alkali \nmetals and their low ionization enthalpies Fig. 3.5  Variation of first ionization enthalpies \n(∆iH) with atomic number for elements with Z = 1 to 60can be correlated with their high reactivity. \nIn addition, you will notice two trends the �first\tionization\tenthalpy\tgenerally\tincreases\tas we go across a period and decreases \nas we descend in a group. These trends are\tillustrated\tin\tFigs.\t3.6(a)\tand\t3.6(b)\trespectively for the elements of the second �period\tand\tthe\tfirst\tgroup\tof\tthe\tperiodic\ttable. You will appreciate that the ionization \nenthalpy and atomic radius are closely related properties. To understand these trends, we �have\tto\tconsider\ttwo\tfactors\t:\t(i)\tthe\tattraction\tof electrons towards the nucleus, and (ii) the \nrepulsion of electrons from each other. The effective nuclear charge experienced by a Fig. 3.6(a) First ionization enthalpies (∆iH) of elements of the second period as a  function of atomic number (Z) and Fig. 3.6(b) ∆iH of alkali metals as a function of Z. 3.6 (a)3.6 (b)Unit 3.indd   889/9/2022   4:36:14 PM89valence electron in an atom will be less than the actual charge on the nucleus because of \n“shielding” or “screening” of the valence \nelectron from the nucleus by the intervening �core\telectrons.\tFor\texample,\tthe\t2s electron in lithium is shielded from the nucleus by \nthe inner core of 1s electrons. As a result, the valence electron experiences a net positive \ncharge which is  less than the actual charge \nof +3. In general, shielding is effective when \nthe orbitals in the inner shells are completely �filled.\tThis\tsituation\toccurs\tin\tthe\tcase\tof\talkali metals which have single outermost \nns-electron preceded by a noble gas electronic configuration.When\twe\tmove\tfrom\tlithium\tto\tfluorine\tacross the second period, successive electrons are added to orbitals in the same principal \nquantum level and the shielding of the nuclear charge by the inner core of electrons does \nnot increase very much to compensate for \nthe increased attraction of the electron to the \nnucleus. Thus, across a period, increasing \nnuclear charge outweighs the shielding. \nConsequently, the outermost electrons are \nheld more and more tightly and the ionization \nenthalpy increases across a period. As we go \ndown a group, the outermost electron being \nincreasingly farther from the nucleus, there is \nan increased shielding of the nuclear charge \nby the electrons in the inner levels. In this \ncase, increase in shielding outweighs the \nincreasing nuclear charge and the removal of \nthe outermost electron requires less energy \ndown a group.From\tFig.\t3.6(a),\tyou\twill\talso\tnotice\tthat\tthe\tfirst\tionization\tenthalpy\tof\tboron\t(Z = 5) is slightly less than that of beryllium (Z = 4) even though the former has a greater nuclear charge. When we consider the same principal \nquantum level, an s-electron is attracted to the nucleus more than a p-electron. In beryllium, the electron removed during the ionization is \nan s-electron whereas the electron removed during ionization of boron is a p-electron. The penetration of a 2s-electron to the nucleus is \nmore than that of a 2p-electron; hence the 2p \nelectron of boron is more shielded from the \nnucleus by the inner core of electrons than the 2s electrons of beryllium. Therefore, it is easier to remove the 2p-electron from boron \ncompared to the removal of a 2s- electron from beryllium.\tThus,\tboron\thas\ta\tsmaller\tfirst\tionization enthalpy than beryllium. Another \n“anomaly” is the smaller first ionization enthalpy of oxygen compared to nitrogen. This \narises because in the nitrogen atom, three \n2p-electrons reside in different atomic orbitals (Hund’s rule) whereas in the oxygen atom, \ntwo of the four 2p-electrons must occupy the \nsame 2p-orbital resulting in an increased \nelectron-electron repulsion. Consequently, \nit is easier to remove the fourth 2p-electron \nfrom oxygen than it is, to remove one of the \nthree 2p-electrons from nitrogen.Problem 3.6 The\tfirst\tionization\tenthalpy\t(∆i H ) values of the third period elements, Na, Mg and Si are respectively 496, 737 and 786 kJ  mol–1.\tPredict\twhether\tthe\tfirst\t∆i H value for Al will be more close to 575 or 760 kJ  mol–1 ? Justify your answer.Solution It will be more close to 575 kJ mol–1. The value for Al should be lower than \nthat of Mg because of effective shielding \nof 3p electrons from the nucleus by  3s-electrons.(d) Electron Gain Enthalpy When an electron is added to a neutral gaseous atom (X) to convert it into a negative \nion, the enthalpy change accompanying the \nprocess is defined as the Electron Gain \nEnthalpy (∆egH). Electron gain enthalpy provides a measure of the ease with which \nan atom adds an electron to form anion as \nrepresented by equation 3.3.X(g) + e–  →  X–(g)            (3.3)Depending on the element, the process of adding an electron to the atom can be either\tendothermic\tor\texothermic.\tFor\tmany\telements energy is released when an electron \nis added to the atom and the electron gain �enthalpy\tis\tnegative.\tFor\texample,\tgroup\t17 elements (the halogens) have very high Unit 3.indd   899/9/2022   4:36:15 PM90negative electron gain enthalpies because they can attain stable noble gas electronic �configurations\tby\tpicking\tup\tan\telectron.\tOn the other hand, noble gases have large positive electron gain enthalpies because the electron has to enter the next higher principal quantum level leading to a very unstable �electronic\tconfiguration.\tIt\tmay\tbe\tnoted\tthat\telectron gain enthalpies have large negative \nvalues toward the upper right of the periodic \ntable preceding the noble gases.The variation in electron gain enthalpies of elements is less systematic than for ionization \nenthalpies. As a general rule, electron gain \nenthalpy becomes more negative with increase in the atomic number across a period. The \neffective nuclear charge increases from left to \nright across a period and consequently it will \nbe easier to add an electron to a smaller atom \nsince the added electron on an average would \nbe closer to the positively charged nucleus. We \nshould also expect electron gain enthalpy to \nbecome less negative as we go down a group \nbecause the size of the atom increases and \nthe added electron would be farther from the \nnucleus. This is generally the case (Table \n3.7). However, electron gain enthalpy of O or �F\tis\tless\tnegative\tthan\tthat\tof\tthe\tsucceeding\telement. This is because when an electron is added\tto\tO\tor\tF,\tthe\tadded\telectron\tgoes\tto\tthe smaller n = 2 quantum level and suffers significant\trepulsion\tfrom\tthe\tother\telectrons\tpresent\tin\tthis\tlevel.\tFor\tthe\tn = 3 quantum level (S or Cl), the added electron occupies \na larger region of space and the electron-electron repulsion is much less.Problem 3.7Which of the following will have the most negative electron gain enthalpy and \nwhich the least negative?�P,\tS,\tCl,\tF.Explain your answer.SolutionElectron gain enthalpy generally \nbecomes more negative across a \nperiod as we move from left to right. Within a group, electron gain enthalpy \nbecomes less negative down a group. \nHowever, adding an electron to the \n2p-orbital leads to greater repulsion than adding an electron to the larger  3p-orbital. Hence the element with most negative electron gain enthalpy is \nchlorine; the one with the least negative \nelectron gain enthalpy is phosphorus.(e) ElectronegativityA qualitative measure of the ability of an atom in a chemical compound to attract shared \nelectrons to itself is called electronegativity. Unlike ionization enthalpy and electron gain \nenthalpy, it is not a measureable quantity. \nHowever, a number of numerical scales of \nelectronegativity of elements viz., Pauling \nscale, Mulliken-Jaffe scale, Allred-Rochow \nscale have been developed. The one which \nis the most widely used is the Pauling scale. \nLinus Pauling, an American scientist, in 1922 �assigned\tarbitrarily\ta\tvalue\tof\t4.0\tto\tfluorine,\tthe element considered to have the greatest * In many books, the negative of the enthalpy change for the process depicted in equation 3.3 is deﬁned as the ELECTRON AFFINITY (Ae ) of the atom under consideration. If energy is released when an electron is added to an atom, the electron afﬁnity is taken as positive, contrary to thermodynamic convention. If energy has to be supplied to add an electron to an \natom, then the electron afﬁnity of the atom is assigned a negative sign. However, electron afﬁnity is deﬁned as absolute \nzero and, therefore at any other temperature (T) heat capacities of the reactants and the products have to be taken into \naccount in ∆egH = Ae  5/2 RT.

Approximate values for the electronegativity of a few \nelements are given in Table 3.8(a)The electronegativity of any given element is not constant; it varies depending on the \nelement to which it is bound. Though it is \nnot a measurable quantity, it does provide a \nmeans of predicting the nature of force that \nholds a pair of atoms together – a relationship \nthat you will explore later.Electronegativity generally increases across a period from \nleft to right (say from lithium to �fluorine)\tand\tdecrease\tdown\ta\tgroup\t(say\tfrom\tfluorine\tto\tastatine)\tin the periodic table. How can \nthese trends be explained? \nCan the electronegativity be \nrelated to atomic radii, which tend to decrease across each \nperiod from left to right, but \nincrease down each group ? The \nattraction between the outer \n(or valence) electrons and the \nnucleus increases as the atomic \nradius decreases in a period. The \nelectronegativity also increases. On the same account electronegativity values \ndecrease with the increase in atomic radii \ndown a group. The trend is similar to that of \nionization enthalpy.Knowing the relationship between electronegativity and atomic radius, can \nyou now visualise the relationship between \nelectronegativity and non-metallic properties? \nNon-metallic  elements have strong tendency Fig. 3.7  The periodic trends of elements in the periodic tableTable 3.8(a)  Electronegativity Values (on Pauling scale) Across the PeriodsAtom (Period II)LiBeBCNOFElectronegativity1.01.52.02.53.03.54.0Atom (Period III)NaMgAlSiPSClElectronegativity0.91.21.51.82.12.53.0Table 3.8(b)  Electronegativity Values (on Pauling scale) Down a FamilyAtom  (Group I)Electronegativity ValueAtom  (Group 17)Electronegativity ValueLi1.0F4.0Na0.9Cl3.0K0.8Br2.8Rb0.8I2.5Cs0.7At2.2Unit 3.indd   919/9/2022   4:36:15 PM92to gain electrons. Therefore, electronegativity is directly related to that non-metallic properties \nof elements. It can be further extended to say \nthat the electronegativity is inversely related \nto the metallic properties of elements. Thus, \nthe increase in electronegativities across \na period is accompanied by an increase \nin non-metallic properties (or decrease in \nmetallic properties) of elements. Similarly, the \ndecrease in electronegativity down a group is \naccompanied by a decrease in non-metallic \nproperties (or increase in metallic properties) \nof elements.All these periodic trends are summarised in\tFigure\t3.7.3.7.2 Periodic Trends in Chemical    PropertiesMost of the trends in chemical properties of elements, such as diagonal relationships, inert \npair effect, effects of lanthanoid contraction \netc. will be dealt with along the discussion \nof each group in later units. In this section \nwe shall study the periodicity of the valence \nstate shown by elements and the anomalous \nproperties of the second period elements (from �lithium\tto\tfluorine).(a) Periodicity of Valence or Oxidation       StatesThe valence is the most characteristic property of the elements and can be understood in terms\tof\ttheir\telectronic\tconfigurations.\t\tThe\tvalence of representative elements is usually (though not necessarily) equal to the number \nof electrons in the outermost orbitals and/or \nequal to eight minus the number of outermost \nelectrons as shown below. Nowadays the term oxidation state is frequently used for valence. Consider the �two\toxygen\tcontaining\tcompounds:\tOF2 and Na2O. The order of electronegativity of the three elements involved in these compounds �is\tF\t\u003e\tO\t\u003e\tNa.\tEach\tof\tthe\tatoms\tof\tfluorine,\twith\touter\telectronic\tconfiguration\t2s22p5, shares\tone\telectron\twith\toxygen\tin\tthe\tOF2 molecule. Being highest electronegative \nelement, fluorine is given oxidation state �–1.\tSince\tthere\tare\ttwo\tfluorine\tatoms\tin\tthis molecule, oxygen with outer electronic �configuration\t2s22p4 shares two electrons with fluorine atoms and thereby exhibits \noxidation state +2. In Na2O, oxygen being more electronegative accepts two electrons, \none from each of the two sodium atoms and, \nthus, shows oxidation state –2. On the other �hand\tsodium\twith\telectronic\tconfiguration\t3s1 loses one electron to oxygen and is given oxidation state +1. Thus, the oxidation state \nof an element in a particular compound can �be\tdefined\tas\tthe\tcharge\tacquired\tby\tits\tatom\ton the basis of electronegative consideration from other atoms in the molecule.Problem 3.8Using the Periodic Table, predict the formulas of compounds which might \nbe formed by the following pairs of \nelements; (a) silicon and bromine  (b) aluminium and sulphur.Solution(a) Silicon is group 14 element with \na valence of 4; bromine belongs to \nthe halogen family with a valence of 1. Hence the formula of the \ncompound formed would be SiBr4.(b) Aluminium belongs to group \n13 with a valence of 3; sulphur belongs to group 16 elements with \na valence of 2. Hence, the formula \nof the compound formed would be Al2S3.Some periodic trends observed in the valence of elements (hydrides and oxides) are shown in Table 3.9. Other such periodic \ntrends which occur in the chemical behaviour \nof the elements are discussed elsewhere in Group12131415161718Number of valence electron12345678alence12343,52,61,70,8Unit 3.indd   929/9/2022   4:36:15 PM93this book. There are many elements which exhibit variable valence. This is particularly \ncharacteristic of transition elements and \nactinoids, which we shall study later.(b) Anomalous Properties of Second        Period ElementsThe\tfirst\telement\tof\teach\tof\tthe\tgroups\t1\t(lithium) and 2 (beryllium) and groups 13-17 (boron\tto\tfluorine)\tdiffers\tin\tmany\trespects\tfrom the other members of their respective group.\tFor\texample,\tlithium\tunlike\tother\talkali metals, and beryllium unlike other \nalkaline earth metals, form compounds with \npronounced covalent character; the other \nmembers of these groups predominantly form ionic compounds.

What are the reasons for the different chemical\tbehaviour\tof\tthe\tfirst\tmember\tof\ta group of elements in the s- and p-blocks compared to that of the subsequent members \nin the same group?

As a consequence of this, the maximum covalency of the first member of each group is 4 (e.g., boron can only form BF4\u001f\u001e\u001d, whereas the other members of the groups can expand their valence shell to accommodate more than \nfour pairs of electrons e.g., aluminium AlF63\u001f\u001e\u001d forms).\tFurthermore,\tthe\tfirst\tmember of p-block elements displays greater ability to form pπ – pπ  multiple bonds to itself (e.g., C = C, C ≡ C,   N = N, N ≡\tΝ) and to other second period elements (e.g., C = O, C = N, C ≡ N,  N = O) compared to subsequent members of the same group.Unit 3.indd   939/9/2022   4:36:15 PM94Problem 3.9Are the oxidation state and covalency of Al in [AlCl(H2O)5]2+ same ?SolutionNo. The oxidation state of Al is +3 and \nthe covalency is 6.3.7.3 Periodic Trends and Chemical   ReactivityWe have observed the periodic trends in certain fundamental properties such as atomic and ionic radii, ionization enthalpy, \nelectron gain enthalpy and valence. We \nknow by now that the periodicity is related to �electronic\tconfiguration.\tThat\tis,\tall\tchemical\tand physical properties are a manifestation of the\telectronic\tconfiguration\tof\telements.\tWe\tshall now try to explore relationships between \nthese fundamental properties of elements with \ntheir chemical reactivity.The atomic and ionic radii, as we know, generally decrease in a period from left to right. As a consequence, the ionization enthalpies \ngenerally increase (with some exceptions as \noutlined in section 3.7.1(a)) and electron gain \nenthalpies become more negative across a \nperiod. In other words, the ionization enthalpy \nof the extreme left element in a period is the \nleast and the electron gain enthalpy of the \nelement on the extreme right is the highest �negative\t(note\t:\tnoble\tgases\thaving\tcompletely\tfilled shells have rather positive electron \ngain enthalpy values). This results into high chemical reactivity at the two extremes and \nthe lowest in the centre. Thus, the maximum \nchemical reactivity at the extreme left (among \nalkali metals) is exhibited by the loss of an \nelectron leading to the formation of a cation \nand at the extreme right (among halogens) \nshown by the gain of an electron forming \nan anion. This property can be related with \nthe reducing and oxidizing behaviour of the \nelements which you will learn later. However, here it can be directly related to the metallic and non-metallic character of elements. Thus, \nthe metallic character of an element, which \nis highest at the extremely left decreases and \nthe non-metallic character increases while \nmoving from left to right across the period. \nThe chemical reactivity of an element can be \nbest shown by its reactions with oxygen and \nhalogens. Here, we shall consider the reaction \nof the elements with oxygen only. Elements \non two extremes of a period easily combine \nwith oxygen to form oxides. The normal oxide \nformed by the element on extreme left is the \nmost basic (e.g., Na2O), whereas that formed by the element on extreme right is the most \nacidic (e.g., Cl2O7). Oxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric (e.g., Al2O3, As2O3) or neutral (e.g., CO, NO, N2O). Amphoteric oxides behave as acidic with bases and as basic with \nacids, whereas neutral oxides have no acidic \nor basic properties.Problem 3.10Show by a chemical reaction with water that Na2O is a basic oxide and Cl2O7 is an acidic oxide.SolutionNa2O with water forms a strong base whereas Cl2O7 forms strong acid.Na2O + H2O → 2NaOHCl2O7 + H2O → 2HClO4Their basic or acidic nature can be qualitatively tested with litmus paper.Among transition metals (3d series), the change in atomic radii is much smaller as compared to those of representative elements \nacross the period. The change in atomic radii \nis still smaller among inner-transition metals  (4f series). The ionization enthalpies are intermediate between those of s- and p-blocks. \nAs a consequence, they are less electropositive \nthan group 1 and 2 metals.Unit 3.indd   949/9/2022   4:36:15 PM95In a group, the increase in atomic and ionic radii with increase in atomic number generally results in a gradual decrease in \nionization enthalpies and a regular decrease \n(with exception in some third period elements \nas shown in section 3.7.1(d)) in electron gain enthalpies in the case of main group elements. Thus, the metallic character increases down the group and non-metallic \ncharacter decreases. This trend can be related \nwith their reducing and oxidizing property \nwhich you will learn later. In the case of \ntransition elements, however, a reverse trend \nis observed. This can be explained in terms of \natomic size and ionization enthalpy.SUMMARYIn this Unit, you have studied the development of the Periodic Law and the Periodic Table. Mendeleev’s Periodic Table was based on atomic masses. Modern Periodic Table arranges the elements in the order of their atomic numbers in seven horizontal rows (periods) and eighteen vertical columns (groups or families). Atomic numbers in a period are consecutive, whereas in a group they increase in a pattern. Elements of the same group have similar \nvalence shell\telectronic\tconfiguration\tand,\ttherefore,\texhibit\tsimilar\tchemical\tproperties.\tHowever, the elements of the same period have incrementally increasing number of electrons �from\tleft\tto\tright,\tand,\ttherefore,\thave\tdifferent\tvalencies.\tFour\ttypes\tof\telements\tcan\tbe\trecognized\tin\tthe\tperiodic\ttable\ton\tthe\tbasis\tof\ttheir\telectronic\tconfigurations.\tThese\tare\ts-block, p-block, d-block and f-block elements. Hydrogen with one electron in the 1s orbital occupies a unique position in the periodic table. Metals comprise more than seventy eight per cent of the known elements. Non-metals, which are located at the top of the periodic table, are less than twenty in number. Elements which lie at the border line between metals and non-metals (e.g., Si, Ge, As) are called metalloids or semi-metals. Metallic character \nincreases with increasing atomic number in a group whereas decreases from left to right \nin a period. The physical and chemical properties of elements vary periodically with their \natomic numbers. Periodic trends are observed in atomic sizes, ionization enthalpies, electron gain enthalpies, electronegativity and valence. The atomic radii decrease while going from left to right in a period and increase with atomic number in a group. Ionization enthalpies generally increase across a period and decrease down a group. Electronegativity also shows \na similar trend. Electron gain enthalpies, in general, become more negative across a period \nand less negative down a group. There is some periodicity in valence, for example, among \nrepresentative elements, the valence is either equal to the number of electrons in the \noutermost orbitals or eight minus this number. Chemical reactivity is highest at the two \nextremes of a period and is lowest in the centre. The reactivity on the left extreme of a period \nis because of the ease of electron loss (or low ionization enthalpy). Highly reactive elements \ndo not occur in nature in free state; they usually occur in the combined form. Oxides formed \nof the elements on the left are basic and of the elements on the right are acidic in nature. \nOxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric or neutral.Unit 3.indd   959/9/2022   4:36:15 PM96EXERCISES3.1 What is the basic theme of organisation in the periodic table?3.2 Which important property did Mendeleev use to classify the elements in his periodic table and did he stick to that?3.3 What is the basic difference in approach between the Mendeleev’s Periodic Law and \nthe Modern Periodic Law?3.4 On the basis of quantum numbers, justify that the sixth period of the periodic table \nshould have 32 elements.3.5 In terms of period and group where would you locate the element with Z =114?3.6 Write the atomic number of the element present in the third period and seventeenth group of the periodic table.3.7 Which element do you think would have been named by (i) Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (ii) Seaborg’s group?3.8 Why do elements in the same group have similar physical and chemical properties?3.9 What does atomic radius and ionic radius really mean to you?3.10 How do atomic radius vary in a period and in a group?

In the case of sodium and \nchlorine, this can happen by the transfer of \nan electron from sodium to chlorine thereby �giving\tthe\tNa+ and Cl– ions. In the case of other molecules like Cl2,\tH2, F2, etc., the bond is formed by the sharing of a pair of electrons \nbetween the atoms. In the process each atom \nattains a stable outer octet of electrons.Lewis Symbols: In the formation of a molecule, only the outer shell electrons take \npart in chemical combination and they are \nknown as valence electrons.\tThe\tinner\tshell\telectrons are well protected and are generally �not\tinvolved\tin\tthe\tcombination\tprocess.

In the process both chlorine atoms attain the outer shell octet of �the\tnearest\tnoble\tgas\t(i.e.,\targon).\tThe dots represent electrons.

Isoelectronic molecules and ions have identical bond orders; for example, F2 and O2 2– have bond order 1. N2, CO and NO+ have bond order 3.A general correlation useful for understanding the stablities of molecules  is that: with increase in bond order, \nbond enthalpy increases and bond length \ndecreases. 4.3.5 Resonance StructuresIt\tis\toften\tobserved\tthat\ta\tsingle\tLewis\tstructure\tis inadequate for the representation of a molecule\tin\tconformity\twith\tits\texperimentally\tdetermined\tparameters.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tozone, O3 molecule can be equally represented by the structures I and II shown below:In\tboth\tstructures\twe\thave\ta\tO–O\tsingle\tbond\tand\ta\tO=O\tdouble\tbond.\tThe\tnormal\t O–O\tand\tO=O\tbond\tlengths\tare\t148\tpm\tand\t121\tpm\trespectively.\tExperimentally\tdetermined\toxygen-oxygen\tbond\tlengths\tin\tthe O3\tmolecule\tare\tsame\t(128\tpm).\tThus\tthe\toxygen-oxygen\tbonds\tin\tthe\tO3 molecule are intermediate between a double and a single bond.\tObviously,\tthis\tcannot\tbe\trepresented\tby\teither\tof\tthe\ttwo\tLewis\tstructures\tshown\tabove.\tThe\tconcept\tof\tresonance\twas\tintroduced\tto\tdeal\twith\tthe\ttype\tof\tdifficulty\texperienced\tin the depiction of accurate structures of molecules like O3. According to the concept of resonance, whenever a single Lewis \nstructure cannot describe a molecule \naccurately, a number of structures with \nsimilar energy, positions of nuclei, bonding \nand non-bonding pairs of electrons are \ntaken as the canonical structures of the \nhybrid which describes the molecule \naccurately.\tThus\tfor\tO3, the two structures shown\tabove\tconstitute\tthe\tcanonical\tstructures or resonance structures and \ntheir hybrid i.e., the III structure represents \nthe structure of O3\tmore\taccurately.\tThis\tis\talso called resonance hybrid.\tResonance\tis\trepresented by a double headed arrow.Fig. 4.3 Resonance in the O3 molecule(structures I and II represent the two canonical forms while the structure III is the resonance hybrid)Unit 4.indd   1099/12/2022   9:36:11 AM110Some\tof\tthe\tother\texamples\tof\tresonance\tstructures\tare\tprovided\tby\tthe\tcarbonate ion and the carbon dioxide molecule.Problem 4.3 Explain\tthe\tstructure\tof\tCO32– ion in terms of resonance.SolutionThe\tsingle\tLewis\tstructure\tbased\ton\tthe presence of two single bonds and one double bond between carbon and\toxygen\tatoms\tis\tinadequate\tto\trepresent the molecule accurately as it \nrepresents unequal bonds.

Consider the hydrogen molecule consisting �of\ttwo\tatoms\tA\tand\tB.\tEach\thydrogen\tatom\tin the ground state has one electron in 1s �orbital.\tThe\tatomic\torbitals\tof\tthese\tatoms\tmay\tbe\trepresented\tby\tthe\twave\tfunctions\tψA and ψB. Mathematically, the formation of molecular orbitals may be described by the \nlinear combination of atomic orbitals that can \ntake place by addition and by subtraction of �wave\tfunctions\tof\tindividual\tatomic\torbitals\tas shown below :ψMO\t=\tψA + ψBTherefore,\tthe\ttwo\tmolecular\torbitals\t σ and σ* are formed as : σ   =  ψA + ψB σ*\t=\t ψA – ψBThe\tmolecular\torbital\tσ formed by the addition of atomic orbitals is called the bonding molecular orbital while the molecular orbital σ* formed by the subtraction of atomic orbital is called antibonding molecular orbital as depicted\tin\tFig.\t4.19.Fig.4.19 Formation of bonding (σ) and antibonding (σ*) molecular orbitals by the linear  combination of atomic orbitals ψA and ψB centered on two atoms A and B respectively.Qualitatively,\tthe\tformation\tof\tmolecular\torbitals can be understood in terms of the �constructive\tor\tdestructive\tinterference\tof\tthe\telectron\twaves\tof\tthe\tcombining\tatoms.\tIn\tthe\tformation of bonding molecular orbital, the �two\telectron\twaves\tof\tthe\tbonding\tatoms\treinforce\teach\tother\tdue\tto\tconstructive\tinterference while in the formation of σ*\t=\tψA – ψBψAψBσ  = ψA + ψBUnit 4.indd   1269/12/2022   9:36:17 AM127antibonding molecular orbital, the electron waves\tcancel\teach\tother\tdue\tto\tdestructive\tinterference. As a result, the electron density in \na bonding molecular orbital is located between \nthe nuclei of the bonded atoms because of �which\tthe\trepulsion\tbetween\tthe\tnuclei\tis\tvery\tless while in case of an antibonding molecular orbital, most of the electron density is located \naway from the space between the nuclei. �Infact,\tthere\tis\ta\tnodal\tplane\t(on\twhich\tthe\telectron\tdensity\tis\tzero)\tbetween\tthe\tnuclei\tand hence the repulsion between the nuclei is �high.\tElectrons\tplaced\tin\ta\tbonding\tmolecular\torbital tend to hold the nuclei together and �stabilise\ta\tmolecule.\tTherefore,\ta\tbonding\tmolecular orbital always possesses lower \nenergy than either of the atomic orbitals that �have\tcombined\tto\tform\tit.\tIn\tcontrast,\tthe\telectrons placed in the antibonding molecular �orbital\tdestabilise\tthe\tmolecule.\tThis\tis\tbecause the mutual repulsion of the electrons \nin this orbital is more than the attraction between the electrons and the nuclei, which \ncauses a net increase in energy.It may be noted that the energy of the antibonding\torbital\tis\traised\tabove\tthe\tenergy of the parent atomic orbitals that have\tcombined\tand\tthe\tenergy\tof\tthe\tbonding\torbital has been lowered than the parent orbitals.\tThe\ttotal\tenergy\tof\ttwo\tmolecular\torbitals,\thowever,\tremains\tthe\tsame\tas\tthat\tof two original atomic orbitals. 4.7.2 Conditions for the Combination of Atomic OrbitalsThe\tlinear\tcombination\tof\tatomic\torbitals\tto\tform molecular orbitals takes place only if the following\tconditions\tare\tsatisfied:1. The combining atomic orbitals must have the same or nearly the same energy. �This\tmeans\tthat\t1s orbital can combine with another 1s orbital but not with 2s orbital because the energy of 2s orbital is appreciably higher than that of 1s\torbital.\tThis\tis\tnot\ttrue\tif\tthe\tatoms\tare\tvery\tdifferent.2. The combining atomic orbitals must have the same symmetry about the molecular axis.\tBy\tconvention\tz-axis\tis\ttaken\tas\tthe\tmolecular\taxis.\tIt\tis\timportant\tto\tnote\tthat\tatomic\torbitals\thaving\tsame\tor\tnearly\tthe same energy will not combine if they do not\thave\tthe\tsame\tsymmetry.\tFor\texample,\t2pz orbital of one atom can combine with 2pz orbital of the other atom but not with the \n2px or 2py orbitals because of their different symmetries. 3. The combining atomic orbitals  must overlap to the maximum extent. Greater the\textent\tof\toverlap,\tthe\tgreater\twill\tbe\tthe\telectron-density\tbetween\tthe\tnuclei\tof\ta\tmolecular orbital.4.7.3 Types of Molecular OrbitalsMolecular orbitals of diatomic molecules are designated as σ\t(sigma),\tπ\t(pi),\tδ (delta),\tetc.In this nomenclature, the sigma () molecular orbitals are symmetrical around the bond-axis while pi () molecular orbitals are not symmetrical.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tlinear\tcombination of 1s orbitals centered on two nuclei produces two molecular orbitals which �are\tsymmetrical\taround\tthe\tbond-axis.\tSuch\tmolecular orbitals are of the σ type and are designated as σ1s and σ*1s\t[Fig.\t4.20(a),\tpage\t124].\tIf internuclear axis is taken to be in the z-direction, it can be seen that a linear \ncombination of 2pz- orbitals of two atoms also produces two sigma molecular orbitals \ndesignated as 2pz and *2pz. [Fig.\t4.20(b)]Molecular orbitals obtained from 2px and 2py orbitals are not symmetrical around the bond\taxis\tbecause\tof\tthe\tpresence\tof\tpositive\tlobes\tabove\tand\tnegative\tlobes\tbelow\tthe\tmolecular\tplane.\tSuch\tmolecular\torbitals,\tare labelled as π and\t=π*\t[Fig.\t4.20(c)].\tA\tπ bonding MO has larger electron density above\tand\tbelow\tthe\tinter-nuclear\taxis.\tThe\tπ* antibonding MO has a node between the nuclei.4.7.4 Energy Level Diagram for Molecular OrbitalsWe\thave\tseen\tthat\t1s atomic orbitals on two atoms form two molecular orbitals designated as σ1s and σ*1s.

    "input": "THERMODYNAMICSIt is the only physical theory of universal content concerning which I am convinced that, within the framework of the \napplicability of its basic concepts, it will never be overthrown.Albert EinsteinChemical energy stored by molecules can be released as heat during chemical reactions when a fuel like methane, \ncooking gas or coal burns in air. The chemical energy may \nalso be used to do mechanical work when a fuel burns \nin an engine or to provide electrical energy through a \ngalvanic cell like dry cell. Thus, various forms of energy \nare interrelated and under certain conditions, these may \nbe transformed from one form into  another. The study \nof these energy transformations forms the subject matter \nof thermodynamics. The laws of thermodynamics deal \nwith energy changes of macroscopic systems involving \na large number of molecules rather than microscopic \nsystems containing a few molecules. Thermodynamics is \nnot concerned about how and at what rate these energy \ntransformations are carried out, but is based on initial and �final states of a system undergoing the change. Laws of \nthermodynamics apply only when a system is in equilibrium \nor moves from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium \nstate. Macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature \ndo not change with time for a system in equilibrium state. \nIn this unit, we would like to answer some of the important \nquestions through thermodynamics, like:How do we determine the energy changes involved in a chemical reaction/process? Will it occur or not?What drives a chemical reaction/process?\nTo what extent do the chemical reactions proceed? UNIT 5After studying this Unit, you will be able to• explain the terms : system and surroundings;• discriminate between close, open \nand isolated systems;• explain internal energy, work and \nheat;• state first law of thermodynamics \nand express it mathematically;• calculate energy changes as \nwork and heat contributions in chemical systems;• explain state functions: U, H. • correlate  ∆U and ∆H;• measure experimentally ∆U and ∆H;• define standard states for ∆H;• calculate enthalpy changes for \nvarious types of reactions; • state and apply Hess’s law of constant heat summation;• differentiate between extensive \nand intensive properties;• define spontaneous and non-\nspontaneous processes;• explain entropy as a thermodynamic state function \nand apply it for spontaneity;• explain Gibbs energy change (∆G); and• establish relationship between �∆G and spontaneity, ∆G and equilibrium constant.Unit 5.indd   1369/12/2022   11:53:33 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         1375.1  THERMODYNAMIC TERMSWe are interested in chemical reactions and the energy changes accompanying them. For \nthis we need to know certain thermodynamic \nterms. These are discussed below. 5.1.1 The System and the SurroundingsA system in thermodynamics refers to that part of universe in which observations are made and remaining universe constitutes the surroundings. The surroundings include everything other than the system. System \nand the surroundings together constitute the \nuniverse. The universe = The system + The surroundingsHowever, the entire universe other than the system is not affected by the changes taking place in the system. Therefore, for all \npractical purposes, the surroundings are that \nportion of the remaining universe which can \ninteract with the system. Usually, the region \nof space in the neighbourhood of the system \nconstitutes its surroundings.For example, if we are studying the reaction between two substances A and B \nkept in a beaker, the beaker containing the \nreaction mixture is the system and the room \nwhere the beaker is kept is the surroundings \n(Fig. 5.1). Fig. 5.1 System and the surroundingsthe system from the surroundings is called \nboundary. This is designed to allow us to \ncontrol and keep track of all movements of \nmatter and energy in or out of the system.  5.1.2 Types of the SystemWe, further classify the systems according to the movements of matter and energy in or out of the system.1. Open SystemIn an open system, there is exchange of energy and matter between system and surroundings \n[Fig. 5.2 (a)]. The presence of reactants in an open beaker is an example of an open system*. Here the boundary is an imaginary surface \nenclosing the beaker and reactants.2. Closed SystemIn a closed system, there is no exchange of matter, but exchange of energy is possible between system and the surroundings  [Fig. 5.2 (b)]. The presence of reactants in a \nclosed vessel made of conducting material \ne.g., copper or steel is an example of a closed \nsystem.Fig. 5.2  Open, closed and isolated systems.Note that the system may be defined by physical boundaries, like beaker or test �tube, or the system may simply be defined \nby a set of Cartesian coordinates specifying \na particular volume in space. It is necessary \nto think of the system as separated from the \nsurroundings by some sort of wall which may \nbe real or imaginary. The wall that separates *  We could have chosen only the reactants as system then walls of the beakers will act as boundary.Unit 5.indd   1379/12/2022   11:53:34 AM1383. Isolated SystemIn an isolated system, there is no exchange of energy or matter between the system and \nthe surroundings [Fig. 5.2 (c)]. The presence �of reactants in a thermos flask or any other closed insulated vessel is an example of an \nisolated system. 5.1.3 The State of the SystemThe system must be described in order to make any useful calculations by specifying \nquantitatively each of the properties such as \nits pressure (p), volume (V), and temperature (T ) as well as the composition of the system. We need to describe the system by specifying \nit before and after the change. You would \nrecall from your Physics course that the \nstate of a system in mechanics is completely �specified at a given instant of time, by the \nposition and velocity of each mass point of \nthe system. In thermodynamics, a different \nand much simpler concept of the state of a \nsystem is introduced. It does not need detailed \nknowledge of motion of each particle  because, \nwe deal with average measurable properties of \nthe system. We specify the state of the system \nby state functions or state variables.The state of a thermodynamic system is described by its measurable or macroscopic  \n(bulk) properties. We can describe the state \nof a gas by quoting its pressure (p), volume \n(V), temperature (T ), amount (n) etc. Variables like p, V, T are called state variables or state functions because their values depend only \non the state of the system and not on how it �is reached. In order to completely define the �state of a system it is not necessary to define \nall the properties of the system; as only a \ncertain number of properties can be varied \nindependently. This number depends on the \nnature of the system. Once these minimum �number of macroscopic properties are fixed, �others automatically have definite values.The state of the surroundings can never be completely specified; fortunately it is not necessary to do so.5.1.4 The Internal Energy as a State FunctionWhen we talk about our chemical system losing or gaining energy, we need to introduce a quantity which represents the total energy of the system. It may be chemical, electrical, \nmechanical or any other type of energy you \nmay think of, the sum of all these is the energy \nof the system. In thermodynamics, we call it  \nthe internal energy, U of the system, which \nmay change, when•\theat passes into or out of the system,•\twork is done on or by the system,•\tmatter enters or leaves the system. These systems are classified accordingly as you have already studied in section 5.1.2.(a) Work Let us first examine a change in internal energy by doing work. We take a system containing some quantity of water in a thermos flask \nor in an insulated beaker. This would not \nallow exchange of heat between the system \nand surroundings through its boundary and \nwe call this type of system as adiabatic. The manner in which the state of such a system \nmay be changed will be called adiabatic \nprocess. Adiabatic process is a process in \nwhich there is no transfer of heat between \nthe system and surroundings. Here, the wall \nseparating the system and the surroundings is called the adiabatic wall (Fig. 5.3). Fig. 5.3 An adiabatic system which does not \npermit the transfer of heat through its \nboundary.Let us bring the change in the internal energy of the system by doing some work on it. Let us call the  initial state of the system \nas state A and its temperature as  TA. Let the internal energy of the system in state A \nbe called UA. We can change the state of the system in two different ways.Unit 5.indd   1389/12/2022   11:53:36 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         139One way: We do some mechanical work, say 1 kJ, by rotating a set of small paddles and �thereby churning water. Let the new state \nbe called B state and its temperature, as \nTB. It is found that TB \u003e TA and the change in temperature, ∆T = TB–TA. Let the internal energy of the system in state B be UB and the change in internal energy, ∆U =UB– UA.Second way: We now do an equal amount (i.e., 1kJ) electrical work with the help of an \nimmersion rod  and note down the temperature �change. We find that the change in temperature \nis same as in the earlier case, say, TB – TA.In fact, the experiments in the above manner were done by J. P. Joule between \n1840–50 and he was able to show that a \ngiven amount of work done on the system, \nno matter how it was done (irrespective of \npath) produced the same change of state, as \nmeasured by the change in the temperature \nof the system. So, it seems appropriate to define a quantity, the internal energy U, whose value \nis characteristic of the state of a system, \nwhereby the adiabatic work, wad required to bring about a change of state is equal to the \ndifference between the value of U in one state and that in another state, ∆U i.e.,∆U =U2 –U1= wadTherefore, internal energy, U, of the system is a state function. By conventions of IUPAC in chemical thermodynamics. The positive sign expresses that wad  is positive when work is done on the system and the internal energy of system \nincreases. Similarly, if the work is done by the system, wad will be negative because internal energy of the system decreases.Can you name some other familiar state functions? Some of other familiar state \nfunctions are V, p, and  T. For example, if we bring a change in temperature of the system \nfrom 25°C to 35°C, the change in temperature \nis 35°C–25°C = +10°C, whether we go straight \nup to 35°C or we cool the system for a few �degrees, then take the system to the final \ntemperature. Thus, T is a state function and \nthe change in temperature is independent of the route taken. Volume of water in a pond, for \nexample, is a state function, because change \nin volume of its water is independent of the �route by which water is filled in the pond, either by rain or by tubewell or by both. (b) HeatWe can also change the internal energy of a system by transfer of heat from the surroundings to the system or vice-versa \nwithout expenditure of work. This exchange \nof energy, which is a result of temperature \ndifference is called heat, q. Let us consider \nbringing about the same change in temperature �(the same initial and final states as before \nin section 5.1.4 (a) by transfer of heat \nthrough thermally conducting walls instead \nof adiabatic walls (Fig. 5.4). We take water at temperature, TA in a container having thermally conducting walls, say made up of copper and enclose it in a \nhuge heat reservoir at temperature, TB. The heat absorbed by the system (water), q can be measured in terms of temperature difference, \nTB – TA. In this case change in internal energy, ∆U = q, when no work is done at constant volume.By conventions of IUPAC in chemical thermodynamics. The  q is positive, when heat \nis transferred from the surroundings to the \nsystem and the internal energy of the system \nincreases and q is negative when heat is \ntransferred from system to the surroundings \nresulting in decrease of the internal energy of the system. * Earlier negative sign was assigned when the work is done on the system and positive sign when the work is done by the system. This is still followed in physics books, although IUPAC has recommended the use of new sign convention.Fig. 5.4 A system which allows heat transfer \nthrough its boundary.Unit 5.indd   1399/12/2022   11:53:37 AM140(c) The general caseLet us consider the general case in which a change of state is brought about both by  doing work and by transfer of heat. We write \nchange in internal energy for this case as:      ∆U = q  + w           (5.1)For a given change in state, q and w can vary depending on how the change is carried out. However, q +w = ∆U will depend only on initial and final state. It will be independent \nof the way the change is carried out. If there \nis no transfer of energy as heat or as work \n(isolated system) i.e., if w = 0 and q = 0, then  ∆ U = 0. \nThe equation 5.1 i.e., ∆U = q + w is mathematical statement of the first law of \nthermodynamics, which states that The energy of an isolated system is \nconstant. It is commonly stated as the law of conservation \nof energy i.e., energy can neither be created \nnor be destroyed.Note: There is considerable difference between the character of the thermodynamic property energy and that of a mechanical property such \nas volume. We can specify an unambiguous \n(absolute) value for volume of a system in a \nparticular state, but not the absolute value of \nthe internal energy. However, we can measure \nonly the changes in the internal energy, ∆U \nof the system. Problem 5.1Express the change in internal energy of a system when(i) No heat is absorbed by the system \nfrom the surroundings, but work \n(w) is done on the system. What \ntype of wall does the system have ?(ii) No work is done on the system, but q  amount of heat is taken out from the system and given to the \nsurroundings. What type of wall \ndoes the system have?(iii) w amount of work is done by the \nsystem and q amount of heat is supplied to the system. What type \nof system would it be?Solution (i)  ∆ U = w ad, wall is adiabatic(ii) ∆ U = – q, thermally conducting walls (iii) ∆ U = q – w, closed system.5.2 APPLICATIONSMany chemical reactions involve the generation of gases capable of doing mechanical work or \nthe generation of heat. It is important for us \nto quantify these changes and relate them to the changes in the internal energy. Let us \nsee how!5.2.1 WorkFirst of all, let us concentrate on the nature of work a system can do. We will consider only mechanical work i.e., pressure-volume work.For understanding pressure-volume work, let us consider a cylinder which contains one mole of an ideal gas fitted with a frictionless piston. Total volume of the gas \nis Vi and pressure of the gas inside is p. If external pressure is pex which is greater  than p, piston is moved inward till the pressure Fig. 5.5 (a) Work done on an ideal gas in a \ncylinder when it is compressed by a constant external pressure, pex (in single step) is equal to the shaded \narea.Unit 5.indd   1409/12/2022   11:53:37 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         141inside becomes equal to pex. Let this change be achieved in a single step and the final volume be Vf . During this compression, suppose piston moves a distance, l and is cross-sectional area of the piston is A  [Fig. 5.5(a)].\nthen, volume change = l × A = ∆V = (Vf  – Vi )We also know, pressure = Therefore, force on the piston = pex . AIf  w is the work done on the system by \nmovement of the piston thenw = force × distance = pex . A .l    = pex . (–∆V) = – pex ∆V = – pex (Vf – Vi )       (5.2)The negative sign of this expression is required to obtain conventional sign for w, which will be positive. It indicates that in case \nof compression work is done on the system. \nHere (Vf – Vi ) will be negative and negative multiplied by negative will be positive. Hence \nthe sign obtained for the work will be positive.If the pressure is not constant at every stage of compression, but changes in number �of finite steps, work done on the gas will be \nsummed over all the steps and will be equal �to – Σ р ∆V [Fig. 5.5 (b)] If the pressure is not constant but changes during the process such that it is always infinitesimally greater than the \npressure of the gas, then, at each stage of \ncompression, the volume decreases by an �infinitesimal amount, dV. In such a case we can calculate the work done on the gas by the  relation w\u001f\u001e\u001dpdVexVVif                                 (5.3)Here, pex at each stage is equal to (pin + dp) in case of compression [Fig. 5.5(c)]. In an expansion process under similar conditions, \nthe external pressure is always less than the \npressure of the system i.e., pex = (pin– dp). In general case we can write, pex = (pin +  dp). Such processes are called reversible processes.A process or change is said to be reversible, if a change is brought out in such a way that the process could, at any moment, �be reversed by an infinitesimal change. �A reversible process proceeds infinitely �slowly by a series of equilibrium states \nsuch that system and the surroundings are �always in near equilibrium with each other. Fig. 5.5 (c) pV-plot when pressure is not constant and changes in infinite steps (reversible conditions) during compression from initial volume, Vi to final volume, Vf . Work done on the gas is represented \nby the shaded area. Fig. 5.5 (b) pV-plot when pressure is not constant \nand changes in finite steps during compression from initial volume, Vi to final volume, Vf . Work done on the gas is represented by the shaded area. Unit 5.indd   1419/12/2022   11:53:37 AM142Processes other than reversible processes are known as irreversible processes.In chemistry, we face problems that can be solved if we relate the work term to the \ninternal pressure of the system. We can \nrelate work to internal pressure of the system \nunder reversible conditions by writing equation 5.3 as follows:wrevexVVVVpdVpdpdVifi\nf\u001f\u001e\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001c()inSince dp × dV is very small we can writewrevVVdi\nf\u001f\u001e\u001dpVin                                (5.4)Now, the pressure of the gas (pin which we can write as p now) can be expressed in terms of its volume through gas equation. For n mol of an ideal gas i.e., pV =nRT\u001f\u001epTVnRTherefore, at constant temperature (isothermal process),  wrev\u001f\u001e\u001f\u001e\u001dnnRRTdVVTVVfiVVifln= – 2.303 nRT log VVfi         (5.5)Free expansion: Expansion of a gas in vacuum (pex = 0) is called free expansion. No work is done during free expansion of an \nideal gas whether the process is reversible or \nirreversible (equation 5.2 and 5.3).Now, we  can write equation 5.1 in number of ways depending on the type of processes.Let us substitute w = – pex∆V (eq. 5.2) in equation 5.1, and we get   \u001f\u001fUqpVex\u001e\u001dIf a process is carried out at constant volume \n(∆V = 0), then ∆U = qVthe subscript V in qV denotes that heat is supplied at constant volume.Isothermal and free expansion of an \nideal gasFor isothermal (T = constant) expansion of an ideal gas into vacuum; w = 0 since pex = 0. Also, Joule determined experimentally that  q = 0; therefore, ∆U = 0Equation 5.1, can be expressed for isothermal irreversible and reversible changes as follows: \n1. For isothermal irreversible change q = – w = pex (Vf – Vi ) 2. For isothermal reversible change  q = – w = nRT ln       =  2.303 nRT log VVfi For adiabatic change, q = 0,  ∆U = wadProblem 5.2Two litres of an ideal gas at a pressure of 10 atm expands isothermally at 25 °C into a \nvacuum until its total volume is 10 litres. \nHow much heat is absorbed and how \nmuch work is done in the expansion ?SolutionWe have  q = – w =  pex (10 – 2) = 0(8) = 0No work is done; no heat is absorbed.Problem 5.3Consider the same expansion, but this time against a constant external \npressure of 1 atm.SolutionWe have  q = – w =  pex (8) = 8 litre-atmProblem 5.4Consider the expansion given in problem 5.2, for 1 mol of an ideal gas conducted \nreversibly.SolutionWe have q = – w =  2.303 nRT logVVfs   = 2.303 × 1 × 0.8206 × 298 × log 102  Unit 5.indd   1429/12/2022   11:53:38 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         143Remember ∆H = qp, heat absorbed by the  system at constant pressure. ∆H is negative for exothermic reactions which evolve heat during the reaction and ∆H is positive for endothermic reactions �which absorb heat from the surroundings. At constant volume (∆V = 0), ∆U = qV, therefore equation 5.8 becomes ∆H = ∆U = qVThe difference between  ∆H and ∆U is not usually significant for systems consisting \nof only solids and / or liquids. Solids and �liquids do not suffer any significant volume \nchanges upon heating. The difference, �however, becomes significant when gases are �involved. Let us consider a reaction involving \ngases. If VA is the total volume of the gaseous reactants, VB is the total volume of the gaseous products, nA is the number of moles of gaseous reactants and nB is the number of moles of gaseous products, all at constant pressure \nand temperature, then using the ideal gas law, we write,  pVA = nARTand  pVB = nBRTThus,  pVB – pVA = nBRT – nART = (nB–nA)RT or p (VB – VA) = (nB – nA) RTor       p ∆V = ∆ngRT (5.9)Here, ∆ng refers to the number of moles of gaseous products minus the number of moles of gaseous reactants.Substituting the value of p∆V from equation 5.9 in equation 5.8, we get ∆H = ∆U + ∆ngRT (5.10)The equation 5.10 is useful for calculating ∆H from ∆U and vice versa. Problem 5.5If water vapour is assumed to be a perfect gas, molar enthalpy change for \nvapourisation of 1 mol of water at 1bar \nand 100°C is 41kJ mol–1. Calculate the internal energy change, when= 2.303 x 0.8206 x 298 x log 5= 2.303 x 0.8206 x 298 x 0.6990�= 393.66 L atm5.2.2 Enthalpy, H(a) A Useful New State FunctionWe know that the heat absorbed at constant volume is equal to change in the internal energy i.e., ∆U = qV. But most of chemical reactions are carried out not at constant �volume, but in flasks or test tubes under \nconstant atmospheric pressure. We need to �define another state function which may be \nsuitable under these conditions. We may write equation (5.1) as ∆U = qp – p∆V at constant pressure, where qp  is heat absorbed by the system and –p∆V represent expansion work done by the system.Let us represent the initial state by  subscript 1 and final state by 2We can rewrite the above equation as U2–U1 = qp – p (V2 – V1)On rearranging, we get\nqp = (U2 + pV2) – (U1 + pV1) (5.6)Now we can define another thermodynamic function, the enthalpy H [Greek word enthalpien, to warm or heat content] as :H = U + pV    (5.7)  so, equation (5.6) becomesqp= H2 – H1 = ∆HAlthough q is a path dependent function, H is a state function because it depends on U, p and V, all of which are state functions. Therefore, ∆H is independent of path. Hence, qp is also independent of path.For finite changes at constant pressure, we can write equation 5.7 as∆H = ∆U + ∆pVSince p is constant, we can write �∆H = ∆U + p∆V (5.8)It is important to note that when heat is absorbed by the system at constant pressure, we are actually measuring changes in the enthalpy.Unit 5.indd   1439/12/2022   11:53:38 AM1441 mol of water is vapourised at 1 bar pressure and 100°C.Solution(i)  The change H2O (l) → H2O (g)∆H = ∆U + ∆ngRTor ∆U = ∆H – ∆ngRT, substituting the values, we get∆U = 41.00 kJ mol–1 – 1   × 8.3 J mol–1 K–1 × 373 K= 41.00 kJ mol-1 – 3.096 kJ mol-1= 37.904 kJ mol–1(c) Heat CapacityIn this sub-section, let us see how to measure heat transferred to a system. This heat \nappears as a rise in temperature of the system \nin case of heat absorbed by the system. The increase of temperature is proportional to the heat transferred qcoeffT\u001f\u001e\u001dThe magnitude of the coefficient depends on the size, composition and nature of the system. We can also write it as q = C ∆TThe coefficient, C is called the heat capacity. Thus, we can measure the heat supplied by monitoring the temperature rise, provided \nwe know the heat capacity. When C is large, a given amount of heat results in only a small temperature rise. Water \nhas a large heat capacity i.e., a lot of energy \nis needed to raise its temperature. C is directly proportional to amount of substance. The molar heat capacity of a substance, Cm=Cn\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a, is the heat capacity for one mole of the substance and is the quantity of heat needed to raise the \ntemperature of one mole by one degree �celsius (or one kelvin). Specific heat, also �called specific heat capacity is the quantity Fig. 5.6(a)  A gas at volume V and temperature TFig. 5.6 (b) Partition, each part having half the \nvolume of the gas(b) Extensive and Intensive PropertiesIn thermodynamics, a distinction is made   between extensive properties and intensive \nproperties. An extensive property is a property whose value depends on the quantity \nor size of matter present in the system. For \nexample, mass, volume, internal energy, \nenthalpy, heat capacity, etc. are extensive \nproperties.Those properties which do not depend on the quantity or size of matter present \nare known as intensive properties. For example temperature, density, pressure etc. \nare intensive properties. A molar property, χm, is the value of an extensive property χ of the system for 1 mol of the substance. If n is the amount of matter, \u001f\u001fm\u001en is independent of the amount of matter. Other examples are molar volume, Vm and molar heat capacity, Cm. Let us understand the distinction between extensive and intensive properties by \nconsidering a gas enclosed in a container of \nvolume V and at temperature T [Fig. 5.6(a)]. Let us make a partition such that volume \nis halved, each part [Fig. 5.6 (b)] now has one half of the original volume, V2, but the temperature will still remain the same i.e., T. It is clear that volume is an extensive property and temperature is an intensive property.

For finding out the \nheat, q, required to raise the temperatures of a sample, we multiply the specific heat \nof the substance, c, by the mass m, and \ntemperatures change, ∆T  as     qcmTCT\u001f\u001e\u001e\u001f\u001d\u001d                   (5.11)(d) The Relationship between Cp and CV   for an Ideal Gas At constant volume, the heat capacity, C is  \ndenoted by CV  and at constant pressure, this is denoted by Cp .

Knowing \nthe heat capacity of the liquid in which \ncalorimeter is immersed and the heat capacity \nof calorimeter, it is possible to determine the \nheat evolved in the process by measuring \ntemperature changes. Measurements are \nmade under two different conditions: i)   at constant volume,  qV ii)  at constant pressure,  qp(a) ∆U MeasurementsFor chemical reactions, heat absorbed at constant volume, is measured in a bomb \ncalorimeter (Fig. 5.7). Here, a steel vessel (the \nbomb) is immersed in a water bath. The whole \ndevice is called calorimeter. The steel vessel is \nimmersed in water bath to ensure that no heat \nis lost to the surroundings. A combustible  Fig. 5.7  Bomb calorimetersubstance is burnt in pure dioxygen supplied in the steel bomb. Heat evolved during the reaction is transferred to the water around the \nbomb and its temperature is monitored. Since \nthe bomb calorimeter is sealed, its volume \ndoes not change i.e., the energy changes \nassociated with reactions are measured at \nconstant volume. Under these conditions, no \nwork is done as the reaction is carried out \nat constant volume in the bomb calorimeter. \nEven for reactions involving gases, there is no \nwork done as ∆V = 0. Temperature change of \nthe calorimeter produced by the completed \nreaction is then converted to qV, by using the known heat capacity of the calorimeter with \nthe help of equation 5.11. Unit 5.indd   1459/12/2022   11:53:39 AM146(B) ∆H MeasurementsMeasurement of heat change at constant pressure (generally under atmospheric pressure) \ncan be done in a calorimeter shown in Fig. 5.8. \nWe know that ∆Η = qp (at constant p) and, therefore, heat absorbed or evolved, qp at constant pressure is also called the heat of \nreaction or enthalpy of reaction, ∆rH. In an exothermic reaction, heat is evolved, and system loses heat to the surroundings. Therefore, qp will be negative and ∆rH will also be negative. Similarly in an endothermic \nreaction, heat is absorbed, qp is positive and ∆rH will be positive.

The enthalpy change of a chemical reaction, is given by the symbol ∆rH∆rH = (sum of enthalpies of products) – (sum                                   of enthalpies of reactants)\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001daiproductsireactantsiiHbH (5.14)Here symbol ∑��������������������i and bi are the stoichiometric Unit 5.indd   1469/12/2022   11:53:40 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         147coefficients of the products and reactants respectively in the balanced chemical \nequation. For example, for the reactionCH4 (g)  +  2O2 (g)   →   CO2 (g)  + 2H2O (l)=−∑∑riProductsireactantsiiHaHbH∆       = [Hm (CO2, g) + 2Hm  (H2O, l)]– [Hm (CH4, g)+ 2Hm (O2, g)]where Hm is the molar enthalpy.Enthalpy change is a very useful quantity.  Knowledge of this quantity is required when one needs to plan the heating or cooling \nrequired to maintain an industrial chemical \nreaction at constant temperature. It is also \nrequired to calculate temperature dependence \nof equilibrium constant.(a) Standard Enthalpy of ReactionsEnthalpy of a reaction depends on the conditions under which a reaction is carried \nout. It is, therefore, necessary that we \nmust specify some standard conditions. The standard enthalpy of reaction is the �enthalpy change for a reaction when all \nthe participating substances are in their \nstandard states.The standard state of a substance at a specified temperature is its pure form at  1 bar. For example, the standard state of liquid ethanol at 298 K is pure liquid ethanol at  1 bar; standard state of solid iron at 500 K is pure iron at 1 bar. Usually data are taken \nat 298 K.Standard conditions are denoted by adding the superscript  to the symbol ∆H, e.g., ∆H(b) Enthalpy Changes during Phase TransformationsPhase transformations also involve energy changes. Ice, for example, requires heat for \nmelting. Normally this melting takes place at constant pressure (atmospheric pressure) and \nduring phase change, temperature remains \nconstant (at 273 K).H2O(s) → H2O(l); ∆fusH = 6.00 kJ moI–1Here ∆fusH is enthalpy of fusion in standard state. If water freezes, then process is reversed and equal amount of heat is given off to the \nsurroundings. The enthalpy change that accompanies melting of one mole of a solid substance  in \nstandard state is called standard enthalpy \nof fusion or molar enthalpy of fusion, �∆fusH.Melting of a solid is endothermic, so all enthalpies of fusion are positive. Water Table 5.1  Standard Enthalpy Changes of Fusion and Vaporisation(Tf and Tb are melting and boiling points, respectively)Unit 5.indd   1479/12/2022   11:53:40 AM148requires heat for evaporation. At constant temperature of its boiling point Tb and at constant pressure:H2O(l) → H2O(g); ∆vapH = + 40.79 kJ moI–1 ∆vapH is the standard enthalpy of vaporisation.Amount of heat required to vaporize one mole of a liquid at constant temperature and under standard pressure (1bar) is called �its standard enthalpy of vaporization or �molar enthalpy of vaporization, ∆vapH. Sublimation is direct conversion of a solid into its vapour. Solid CO2 or ‘dry ice’ sublimes at 195K with ∆subH=25.2 kJ mol–1; naphthalene sublimes slowly and for this  ∆sub H = 73.0 kJ mol–1 .Standard enthalpy of sublimation, ∆subH is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a solid substance sublimes at a \nconstant temperature and under standard \npressure (1bar).The magnitude of the enthalpy change depends on the strength of the intermolecular \ninteractions in the substance undergoing \nthe phase transfomations. For example, \nthe strong hydrogen bonds between water \nmolecules hold them tightly in liquid phase. \nFor an organic liquid, such as acetone, the \nintermolecular dipole-dipole interactions are �significantly weaker. Thus, it requires less \nheat to vaporise 1 mol of acetone than it does \nto vaporize 1 mol of water. Table 5.1 gives \nvalues of standard enthalpy changes of fusion \nand vaporisation for some substances.SolutionWe can represent the process of evaporation as vaporisation22 HO(1)HO(g)1mol1mol →No. of moles in 18 g H2O(l) is –118g==1 mol18g molHeat supplied to evaporate18g water at 298 K = n × ∆vap H  = (1 mol) × (44.01 kJ mol–1)  = 44.01 kJ(assuming steam behaving as an ideal \ngas).∆vapU = ∆vapH – p∆V = ∆vapH – ∆ngRT ∆vapHV – ∆ngRT = 44.01 kJ       –(1)(8.314 JK–1mol–1)(298K)(10–3kJ J–1)∆vapUV = 44.01 kJ – 2.48kJ          = 41.53 kJ\nProblem 5.8Assuming the water vapour to be a perfect gas, calculate the internal energy change \nwhen 1 mol of water at 100°C and 1 bar \npressure is converted to ice at 0°C.

Calculate the internal energy \nof vaporisation at 298K. ∆vap H for waterat 298K= 44.01kJ mol–1Unit 5.indd   1489/12/2022   11:53:40 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         149of aggregation (also known as reference states)  is called Standard Molar Enthalpy of Formation. Its symbol is ∆fH, where the subscript ‘ f ’ indicates that one mole of the compound in question has been formed in its \nstandard state from its elements in their most \nstable states of aggregation. The reference \nstate of an element is its most stable state \nof aggregation at 25°C and 1 bar pressure.  For example, the reference state of dihydrogen \nis H2 gas and those of dioxygen, carbon and sulphur are O2 gas, Cgraphite and Srhombic respectively. Some reactions with standard \nmolar enthalpies of formation are as follows. Table 5.2 Standard Molar Enthalpies of Formation (∆f H) at 298K of a Few  Selected SubstancesTherefore,  ∆H = - 7.56 kJ mol-1 + (-6.00 kJ mol-1)                = -13.56 kJ mol-1 There is negligible change in the volume during the change form liquid to solid state.Therefore, p∆v = ∆ng RT = 0∆H = ∆U = - 13.56kJ mol-1(c) Standard Enthalpy of Formation The standard enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of a compound from \nits elements in their most stable states Unit 5.indd   1499/12/2022   11:53:40 AM150H2(g) + ½O2 (g) → H2O(1);∆f H = –285.8 kJ mol–1C (graphite, s) + 2H2(g) → Ch4 (g);∆f H = –74.81 kJ mol–12C (graphite, s)+3H2 (g)+ ½O2(g) → C2H5OH(1);∆f H  = – 277.7kJ mol–1It is important to understand that a standard molar enthalpy of formation, ∆fH , is just a special case of ∆rH , where one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements, as in the above three equations, \nwhere 1 mol of each, water, methane and \nethanol is formed. In contrast, the enthalpy \nchange for an exothermic reaction:CaO(s) + CO2(g) → CaCo3(s);∆rH  = – 178.3kJ mol–1is not an enthalpy of formation of calcium carbonate, since calcium carbonate has been \nformed from other compounds, and not from \nits constituent elements. Also, for the reaction \ngiven below, enthalpy change is not standard \nenthalpy of formation, ∆fH  for HBr(g).H2(g) + Br2(l) → 2HBr(g); ∆r H  = – 178.3kJ mol–1Here two moles, instead of one mole of the product is formed from the elements, i.e., ∆r H  = 2∆f HTherefore, by dividing all coefficients in the balanced equation by 2, expression for enthalpy of formation of HBr (g) is written as \n½H2(g) + ½Br2(1) → HBr(g);∆f H = – 36.4 kJ mol–1Standard enthalpies of formation of some common substances are given in Table 5.2.By convention, standard enthalpy for formation, ∆fH, of an element in reference state, i.e., its most stable state of aggregation \nis taken as zero. Suppose, you are a chemical engineer and want to know how much heat is required to \ndecompose calcium carbonate to lime and \ncarbon dioxide, with all the substances in \ntheir standard state. CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g); ∆r H  = ?Here, we can make use of standard enthalpy \nof formation and calculate the enthalpy \nchange for the reaction. The following general \nequation can be used for the enthalpy change \ncalculation. ∆rH = i∑ai ∆f H (products) – i∑bi ∆f H (reactants)                 (5.15)where a and b represent the coefficients of the products and reactants in the balanced equation. Let us apply the above equation for \ndecomposition of calcium carbonate. Here, �coefficients ‘a’ and ‘b’ are 1 each. Therefore,∆rH = ∆f H  = [CaO(s)]+ ∆f H  [CO2(g)]– ∆f H  = [CaCO3(s)]=1 (–635.1 kJ mol–1) + 1(–393.5 kJ mol–1)–1(–1206.9 kJ mol–1)= 178.3 kJ mol–1Thus, the decomposition of CaCO3 (s) is an endothermic process and you have to heat it for getting the desired products. (d) Thermochemical EquationsA balanced chemical equation together with the value of its ∆rH is called a thermochemical equation. We specify the physical state \n(alongwith allotropic state) of the substance \nin an equation. For example: C2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l);∆rH = – 1367 kJ mol–1The above equation describes the combustion of liquid ethanol at constant temperature and pressure. The negative sign \nof enthalpy change indicates that this is an exothermic reaction. It would be necessary to remember the following conventions regarding thermo-chemical equations. 1. The coefficients in a balanced thermo-\nchemical equation refer to the number of \nmoles (never molecules) of reactants and products involved in the reaction. 2. The numerical value of ∆rH refers to the number of moles of substances specified \nby an equation. Standard enthalpy change �∆rH will have units as kJ mol–1. Unit 5.indd   1509/12/2022   11:53:40 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         151To illustrate the concept, let us consider the calculation of heat of reaction for the following  reaction :FeOsHgFesHOl2322323\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001e\u001c\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001e,From the Table (5.2) of standard enthalpy of \nformation (∆f H), we find :∆f H (H2O,l) = –285.83 kJ mol–1;∆f H (Fe2O3,s)  = – 824.2 kJ mol–1; Also  ∆f H (Fe, s) = 0 and         ∆f H (H2, g) = 0 as per conventionThen, ∆f H1 = 3(–285.83 kJ mol–1)                                  – 1(– 824.2 kJ mol–1)         =  (–857.5 + 824.2) kJ mol–1               =  –33.3 kJ mol–1Note that the coefficients used in these calculations are pure numbers, which \nare equal to the respective stoichiometric \ncoefficients. The unit for ∆rH is  kJ mol–1, which means per mole of reaction. Once we balance the chemical equation in a �particular way, as above, this defines the mole of reaction. If we had balanced the equation \ndifferently, for example,12323\n22322FeOsHgFesHOl\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001e\u001c\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001ethen this amount of reaction would be one \nmole of reaction and ∆rH would be∆f H2 = 32(–285.83 kJ mol–1)          – 12(–824.2 kJ mol–1)  = (– 428.7 + 412.1) kJ mol–1= –16.6 kJ mol–1 =  ½ ∆r H1 It shows that enthalpy is an extensive \nquantity.3. When a chemical equation is reversed, the value of ∆rH is reversed in sign. For exampleN2(g) + 3H2 (g) → 2NH3 (g);∆r H = – 91.8 kJ. mol–12NH3(g) → N2(g) + 3H2 (g);∆r H = + 91.8 kJ mol–1(e) Hess’s Law of Constant Heat \nSummation We know that enthalpy is a state function, \ntherefore the change in enthalpy is independent  of the path between initial state (reactants) �and final state (products). In other words, \nenthalpy change for a reaction is the same \nwhether it occurs in one step or in a series \nof steps. This may be stated as follows in the �form of Hess’s Law.If a reaction takes place in several steps then its standard reaction enthalpy \nis the sum of the standard enthalpies of �the intermediate reactions into which the overall reaction may be divided at the same \ntemperature.Let us understand the importance of this law with the help of an example.Consider the enthalpy change for the reactionC (graphite,s) +  O2 (g) → CO (g); ∆r H  = ?Although CO(g) is the major product, some CO2 gas is always produced in this reaction. Therefore, we cannot measure enthalpy change for the above reaction directly. �However, if we can find some other reactions \ninvolving related species, it is possible to \ncalculate the enthalpy change for the above \nreaction. Let us consider the following reactions:  C (graphite,s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g); ∆r H = – 393.5 kJ mol–1 (i)CO (g) + 12O2 (g) → CO2 (g)∆r H = – 283.0 kJ mol–1 (ii)We can combine the above two reactions in such a way so as to obtain the desired reaction. To get one mole of CO(g) on the \nright, we reverse equation (ii). In this, heat \nis absorbed instead of being released, so we \nchange sign of ∆rH valueCO2 (g) → CO (g) +  O2 (g);∆r H = + 283.0 kJ mol–1 (iii)         Unit 5.indd   1519/12/2022   11:53:41 AM152Adding equation (i) and (iii), we get the desired equation, CgraphitesOgCOg,;\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001e\u001c\u001f\u001e122for which ∆r H  = (– 393.5 + 283.0)= – 110.5 kJ mol–1In general, if enthalpy of an overall reaction A→B along one route is ∆rH and ∆rH1, ∆rH2, ∆rH3..... representing enthalpies of reactions leading to same product, B along another route, then we have∆rH = ∆rH1 + ∆rH2 + ∆rH3 ... (5.16) It can be represented as: 5.5 ENTHALPIES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF REACTIONSIt is convenient to give name to enthalpies specifying the types of reactions.(a) Standard Enthalpy of Combustion (symbol : ∆cH)Combustion reactions are exothermic in \nnature. These are important in industry, \nrocketry, and other walks of life. Standard �enthalpy of combustion is defined as the \nenthalpy change per mole (or per unit amount) \nof a substance, when it undergoes combustion \nand all the reactants and products being \nin their standard states at the specified \ntemperature. Cooking gas in cylinders contains mostly butane (C4H10). During complete combustion of one mole of butane, 2658 kJ of heat is released. We can write the thermochemical \nreactions for this as: CHgOgCOgHO410222132451()()()();\u001f\u001e\u001f∆C H  = – 2658.0 kJ mol–1Similarly, combustion of glucose gives out 2802.0 kJ/mol of heat, for which the overall \nequation is :CHOgOgCOgHO61262226661()()()();\u001f\u001e\u001f∆C H  = – 2802.0 kJ mol–1Our body also generates energy from food by the same overall process as combustion, �although the final products are produced after \na series of complex bio-chemical reactions \ninvolving enzymes.ABCD∆H1∆rH2∆rH3∆rHProblem 5.9The combustion of one mole of benzene takes place at 298 K and 1 atm. After \ncombustion, CO2(g) and H2O (1) are produced and 3267.0 kJ of heat is \nliberated. Calculate the standard \nenthalpy of formation, ∆f H of benzene. Standard enthalpies of formation of \nCO2(g) and H2O(l) are –393.5 kJ mol–1 and – 285.83 kJ mol–1 respectively.

(iv)In this case, the enthalpy of atomization is same as the enthalpy of sublimation.(c) Bond Enthalpy (symbol: ∆bondH)Chemical reactions involve the breaking and making of chemical bonds. Energy is required \nto break a bond and energy is released when a \nbond is formed. It is possible to relate heat of \nreaction to changes in energy associated with \nbreaking and making of chemical bonds. With \nreference to the enthalpy changes associated \nwith chemical bonds, two different terms are \nused in thermodynamics. (i) Bond dissociation enthalpy(ii) Mean bond enthalpyLet us discuss these terms with reference to diatomic and polyatomic molecules.Diatomic Molecules: Consider the following process in which the bonds in one mole of \ndihydrogen gas (H2) are broken:H2(g)  →  2H(g);  ∆H–HH  = 435.0 kJ mol–1The enthalpy change involved in this process \nis the bond dissociation enthalpy of H–H \nbond. The bond dissociation enthalpy is the \nchange in enthalpy when one mole of covalent \nbonds of a gaseous covalent compound is \nbroken to form products in the gas phase.Note that it is the same as the enthalpy of atomization of dihydrogen. This is true for all \ndiatomic molecules. For example:Cl2(g)  →  2Cl(g);  ∆Cl–ClH  = 242 kJ mol–1O2(g)  →  2O(g);  ∆O=OH  = 428 kJ mol–1In the case of polyatomic molecules, bond dissociation enthalpy is different for different bonds within the same molecule.Polyatomic Molecules: Let us now consider a polyatomic molecule like methane, CH4. The overall thermochemical equation for its \natomization reaction is given below: 4CH(g)C(g)4H(g);→+∆a H  = 1665 kJ mol–1In methane, all the four C – H bonds are identical in bond length and energy. However, \nthe energies required to break the individual \nC – H bonds in each successive step differ :(b) Enthalpy of Atomization  \n(symbol: ∆aH)Consider the following example of atomization of dihydrogen H2(g)  →  2H(g);  ∆aH = 435.0 kJ mol–1You can see that H atoms are formed by breaking H–H bonds in dihydrogen. The \nenthalpy change in this process is known \nas enthalpy of atomization, ∆aH. It is the enthalpy change on breaking one mole of \nbonds completely to obtain atoms in the gas \nphase.In case of diatomic molecules, like dihydrogen (given above), the enthalpy of \natomization is also the bond dissociation \nenthalpy. The other examples of enthalpy of \natomization can be CH4(g)  →  C(g) + 4H(g); ∆aH  = 1665 kJ mol–1Note that the products are only atoms of C and H in gaseous phase. Now see the following reaction:Na(s)  →  Na(g);  ∆aH  = 108.4 kJ mol–1Unit 5.indd   1539/12/2022   11:53:42 AM154CH4(g) → CH3(g)+H(g);∆bond H = +427 kJ mol–1CH3(g) → CH2(g)+H(g);∆bond H = +439 kJ mol–1CH2(g) → CH(g)+H(g);∆bond H = +452 kJ mol–1CH(g) → C(g)+H(g);∆bond H = +347 kJ mol–1Therefore,CH4(g) → C(g)+4H(g);∆a H = 1665 kJ mol–1In such cases we use mean bond enthalpy of C – H bond.For example in CH4, ∆C–HH  is calculated as: ∆C–HH = ¼ (∆a H) = ¼ (1665 kJ mol–1)                              = 416 kJ mol–1We find that mean C–H bond enthalpy in methane is 416 kJ/mol. It has been \nfound that mean C–H bond enthalpies differ \nslightly from compound to compound, as \nin CH3CH2Cl, CH3NO2, etc., but it does not differ in a great deal*. Using Hess’s law, bond \nenthalpies can be calculated. Bond enthalpy \nvalues of some single and multiple bonds are given in Table 5.3. The reaction enthalpies are \nvery important quantities as these arise from \nthe changes that accompany the breaking of \nold bonds and formation of the new bonds. \nWe can predict enthalpy of a reaction in gas \nphase, if we know different bond enthalpies. \nThe standard enthalpy of reaction, ∆rH is related to bond enthalpies of the reactants \nand products in gas phase reactions as:∆r H       (5.17)**This relationship is particularly more useful when the required values of ∆f H are not available. The net enthalpy change of a reaction is the amount of energy required \nto break all the bonds in the reactant \nmolecules minus the amount of energy \nrequired to break all the bonds in the product \nmolecules.

(d)  Lattice EnthalpyThe lattice enthalpy of an ionic compound is the enthalpy change which occurs when one \nmole of an ionic compound dissociates into \nits ions in gaseous state.NaClsNagClg\u001f\u001e\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001f\u001d\u001c();  ∆latticeH = +788 kJ mol–1Since it is impossible to determine lattice enthalpies directly by experiment, we use an indirect method where we construct an enthalpy diagram called a Born-Haber Cycle (Fig. 5.9).Let us now calculate the lattice enthalpy of Na+Cl–(s) by following steps given below : 1. NasNag()()→, sublimation of sodium  metal, ∆subH = 108.4 kJ mol–12.

You have learnt about ionization enthalpy and electron gain enthalpy in Unit 3. In fact, these terms have been taken \nfrom thermodynamics. Earlier terms, �ionization energy and electron affinity \nwere in practice in place of the above �terms (see the box for justification).Fig. 5.9  Enthalpy diagram for lattice enthalpy of NaCl5.

Therefore the solubility of \nmost salts in water increases with rise of temperature. If the lattice enthalpy is very \nhigh, the dissolution of the compound may �not take place at all. Why do many fluorides \ntend to be less soluble than the corresponding \nchlorides? Estimates of the magnitudes of \nenthalpy changes may be made by using \ntables of bond energies (enthalpies) and lattice \nenergies (enthalpies).(f)   Enthalpy of Dilution It is known that enthalpy of solution is the enthalpy change associated with the addition of a specified amount of solute to the specified \namount of solvent at a constant temperature \nand pressure. This argument can be applied \nto any solvent with slight modification. \nEnthalpy change for dissolving one mole of \ngaseous hydrogen chloride in 10 mol of water \ncan be represented by the following equation. \nFor convenience we will use the symbol aq. \nfor water HCl(g) + 10 aq. → HCl.10 aq.  ∆H = –69.01 kJ / molLet us consider the following set of enthalpy changes:\n(S-1) HCl(g) + 25 aq. → HCl.25 aq.  ∆H = –72.03 kJ / mol (S-2) HCl(g) + 40 aq. → HCl.40 aq.  ∆H = –72.79 kJ / mol(S-3) HCl(g) +  ∞ aq. → HCl. ∞ aq.  ∆H = –74.85 kJ / molThe values of ∆H show general dependence of the enthalpy of solution on amount of solvent. As more and more solvent is used, the enthalpy of solution approaches a limiting \nvalue, i.e, the value in infinitely dilute \nsolution. For hydrochloric acid this value of �∆H is given above in equation (S-3). cycle. The importance of the cycle is that, the sum of the enthalpy changes round a \ncycle is zero. Applying Hess’s law, we get,∆latticeH = 411.2 + 108.4 + 121 + 496 – 348.6∆latticeH = + 788kJfor NaCl(s)  Na+(g) + Cl–(g)Internal energy is smaller by 2RT (because ∆ng = 2) and is equal to + 783 kJ mol–1.Now we use the value of lattice enthalpy to calculate enthalpy of solution from the \nexpression:∆solH = ∆latticeH + ∆hydH For one mole of NaCl(s), lattice enthalpy  = + 788 kJ mol–1and ∆hydH = – 784 kJ mol–1( from the   literature)∆sol H = + 788 kJ mol–1 – 784 kJ mol–1            = + 4 kJ mol–1The dissolution of NaCl(s) is accompanied by very little heat change. (e)   Enthalpy of Solution (symbol : ∆solH )Enthalpy of solution of a substance is the enthalpy change when one mole of it dissolves �in a specified amount of solvent. The enthalpy �of solution at infinite dilution is the enthalpy \nchange observed on dissolving the substance �in an infinite amount of solvent when the \ninteractions between the ions (or solute \nmolecules) are negligible. When an ionic compound dissolves in a solvent, the ions leave their ordered positions \non the crystal lattice. These are now more free in \nsolution. But solvation of these ions (hydration \nin case solvent is water) also occurs at the same time. This is shown diagrammatically, for an ionic compound, AB (s) Unit 5.indd   1569/12/2022   11:53:43 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         157If we subtract the first equation (equation S-1) from the second equation (equation S-2) in the above set of equations, we obtain– HCl.25 aq. + 15 aq. → HCl.40 aq.  ∆H = [ –72.79 – (–72.03)] kJ / mol       = – 0.76 kJ / mol This value (–0.76kJ/mol) of ∆H is enthalpy of dilution. It is the heat withdrawn from the surroundings when additional solvent is \nadded to the solution. The enthalpy of dilution \nof a solution is dependent on the original \nconcentration of the solution and the amount \nof solvent added. 5.6 SPONTANEITYThe first law of thermodynamics tells us about the relationship between the heat absorbed and the work performed on or \nby a system. It puts no restrictions on \nthe direction of heat flow. However, the �flow of heat is unidirectional from higher \ntemperature to lower temperature. In fact, \nall naturally occurring processes whether \nchemical or physical will tend to proceed \nspontaneously in one direction only. For �example, a gas expanding to fill the available \nvolume, burning carbon in dioxygen giving \ncarbon dioxide. But heat will not flow from colder body to warmer body on its own, the gas in a container \nwill not spontaneously contract into one \ncorner or carbon dioxide will not form carbon \nand dioxygen spontaneously. These and many \nother spontaneously occurring changes show \nunidirectional change. We may ask ‘what is \nthe driving force of spontaneously occurring \nchanges ? What determines the direction of a \nspontaneous change ? In this section, we shall \nestablish some criterion for these processes \nwhether these will take place or not.Let us first understand what do we mean by spontaneous reaction or change ? You \nmay think by your common observation that \nspontaneous reaction is one which occurs \nimmediately when contact is made between \nthe reactants. Take the case of combination \nof hydrogen and oxygen. These gases may \nbe mixed at room temperature and left for many years without observing any perceptible \nchange. Although the reaction is taking place \nbetween them, it is at an extremely slow \nrate. It is still called spontaneous reaction. \nSo spontaneity means ‘having the potential \nto proceed without the assistance of external \nagency’. However, it does not tell about the \nrate of the reaction or process. Another aspect \nof spontaneous reaction or process, as we see \nis that these cannot reverse their direction on \ntheir own. We may summarise it as  follows: A spontaneous process is an  \nirreversible process and may only be \nreversed by some external agency.(a)  Is Decrease in Enthalpy a Criterion   for Spontaneity ?If we examine the phenomenon like flow of \nwater down hill or fall of a stone on to the �ground, we find that there is a net decrease \nin potential energy in the direction of change. \nBy analogy, we may be tempted to state that  \na chemical reaction is spontaneous in a \ngiven direction, because decrease in energy \nhas taken place, as in the case of exothermic \nreactions. For example:12N2(g) + H2(g) = NH3(g);                                        ∆r H  = – 46.1 kJ mol–112H2(g) + 12Cl2(g) = HCl (g);                                    ∆r H  = – 92.32 kJ mol–1H2(g) + 12 O2(g) → H2O(l) ;                                    ∆r H  = –285.8 kJ mol–1The decrease in enthalpy in passing from reactants to products may be shown for any \nexothermic reaction on an enthalpy diagram \nas shown in Fig. 5.10(a). Thus, the postulate that driving force for a chemical reaction may be due to decrease \nin energy sounds ‘reasonable’ as the basis of \nevidence so far !Now let us examine the following reactions:12 N2(g) + O2(g) → NO2(g);                                        ∆r H = +33.2 kJ mol–1C(graphite, s) + 2 S(l) → CS2(l);                                       ∆r H = +128.5 kJ mol–1Unit 5.indd   1579/12/2022   11:53:43 AM158These reactions  though endothermic, are spontaneous. The increase in enthalpy may be represented on an enthalpy diagram as \nshown in Fig. 5.10(b).Fig. 5.10 (a) Enthalpy diagram for exothermic \nreactionsFig. 5.10 (b) Enthalpy diagram for endothermic \nreactionsFig. 5.11  Diffusion of two gasesrespectively and separated by a movable \npartition [Fig. 5.11 (a)]. When the partition is \nwithdrawn [Fig. 5.11(b)], the gases begin to \ndiffuse into each other and after a period of \ntime, diffusion will be complete.Let us examine the process. Before partition, if we were to pick up the gas \nmolecules from left container, we would be \nsure that these will be molecules of gas A \nand similarly if we were to pick up the gas \nmolecules from right container, we would \nbe sure that these will be molecules of gas \nB. But, if we were to pick up molecules from \ncontainer when partition is removed, we are \nnot sure whether the molecules picked are of \ngas A or gas B. We say that the system has \nbecome less predictable or more chaotic. We may now formulate another postulate:  in an isolated system, there is always a \ntendency for the systems’ energy to become \nmore disordered or chaotic and this could be \na criterion for spontaneous change !At this point, we introduce another thermodynamic function, entropy denoted \nas S. The above mentioned disorder is the manifestation of entropy. To form a mental Therefore, it becomes obvious that while decrease in enthalpy may be a contributory \nfactor for spontaneity, but it is not true for \nall cases.(b) Entropy and Spontaneity\nThen, what drives the spontaneous process in a given direction ?  Let us examine such a \ncase in which ∆H = 0 i.e., there is no change in enthalpy, but still the process is spontaneous.Let us consider diffusion of two gases into each other in a closed container which \nis isolated from the surroundings as shown \nin Fig. 5.11. The two gases, say, gas A and gas B are represented by black dots and white dots Unit 5.indd   1589/12/2022   11:53:47 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         159picture, one can think of entropy as a measure of the degree of randomness or disorder in the \nsystem. The greater the disorder in an isolated \nsystem, the higher is the entropy.  As far as a \nchemical reaction is concerned, this entropy \nchange  can be attributed to rearrangement of \natoms or ions from one pattern in the reactants \nto another (in the products). If the structure \nof the products is very much disordered than \nthat of the reactants, there will be a resultant \nincrease in entropy. The change in entropy \naccompanying a chemical reaction may be \nestimated qualitatively by a consideration of \nthe structures of the species taking part in the \nreaction. Decrease of regularity in structure \nwould mean increase in entropy. For a given \nsubstance, the crystalline solid state is the \nstate of lowest entropy (most ordered), The \ngaseous state is state of highest entropy.Now let us try to quantify entropy. One way to calculate the degree of disorder or chaotic \ndistribution of energy among molecules \nwould be through statistical method which \nis beyond the scope of this treatment. Other \nway would be to relate this process to the \nheat involved in a process which would make \nentropy a thermodynamic concept. Entropy, \nlike any other thermodynamic property such \nas internal energy U and enthalpy H is a state function and ∆S is independent of path.Whenever heat is added to the system, it increases molecular motions causing \nincreased randomness in the system. Thus \nheat (q) has randomising influence on the \nsystem. Can we then equate ∆S with q ? Wait ! Experience suggests us that the distribution \nof heat also depends on the temperature at \nwhich heat is added to the system. A system at \nhigher temperature has greater randomness \nin it  than one at lower temperature. Thus, temperature is the measure of average \nchaotic motion of particles in the system. \nHeat added to a system at lower temperature \ncauses greater randomness than when the \nsame quantity of heat is added to it at higher \ntemperature. This suggests that the entropy \nchange is inversely proportional to the \ntemperature. ∆S is related with q and T for a reversible reaction as : ∆S =qTrev (5.18)The total entropy change (∆Stotal) for the system and surroundings of a spontaneous \nprocess is given by\u001f\u001f\u001fSSStotalsystemsurr\u001e\u001d\u001c0                   (5.19)When a system is in equilibrium, the entropy is maximum, and the change in \nentropy, ∆S = 0.We can say that entropy for a spontaneous process increases till it reaches maximum \nand at equilibrium the change in entropy is \nzero. Since entropy is a state property, we can \ncalculate the change in entropy of a reversible \nprocess by∆Ssys = qsysrev,T  We find that both for reversible and irreversible expansion for an ideal gas, under isothermal conditions, ∆U = 0,  but ∆Stotal  i.e., \u001f\u001fSSsyssurr\u001eis not zero for irreversible process. Thus,  ∆U does not discriminate between reversible and irreversible process, whereas ∆S does.Problem 5.10Predict in which of the following, entropy increases/decreases :(i) A liquid crystallizes into a solid.(ii) Temperature of a crystalline solid is raised from 0 K to 115 K.iiiNaHCOsNaCOsCOgHOg\u001f\u001e\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001e\u001c\u001f\u001e\u001c\u001f\u001e232322(iv) HgHg22\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001eSolution(i) After freezing, the molecules attain \nan ordered state and therefore, \nentropy decreases.(ii) At 0 K, the contituent particles are \nstatic and entropy is minimum. \nIf temperature is raised to 115 K, these begin to move and oscillate Unit 5.indd   1599/12/2022   11:53:48 AM160about their equilibrium positions in the lattice and system becomes \nmore disordered, therefore entropy \nincreases.(iii) Reactant, NaHCO3 is a solid and it has low entropy.

But most of \nthe chemical reactions fall into the category \nof either closed systems or open systems. \nTherefore, for most of the chemical reactions \nthere are changes in both enthalpy and \nentropy. It is clear from the discussion in \nprevious sections that neither decrease in \nenthalpy nor increase in entropy alone can \ndetermine the direction of spontaneous \nchange for these systems.For this purpose, we define a new thermodynamic function the Gibbs energy \nor Gibbs function, G, as G = H – TS                                      (5.20)Gibbs function, G is an extensive property and a state function.The change in Gibbs energy for the system, ∆Gsys can be written as\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001fGHTSSTsyssyssyssys=\u001e\u001eAt constant temperature, \u001f\u001e\u001d\u001d\u001dGHTSsyssyssys= Usually the subscript ‘system’ is dropped and we simply write this equation as  \u001f\u001f\u001fGHTS\u001e\u001d                                 (5.21)Thus, Gibbs energy change = enthalpy change – temperature × entropy change, and is referred to as the Gibbs equation, one of \nthe most important equations in chemistry. \nHere, we have considered both terms together \nfor spontaneity: energy (in terms of ∆H) and entropy (∆S, a measure of disorder) as \nindicated earlier. Dimensionally if we analyse, �we find that ∆G has units of energy because, both ∆H and the T∆S are energy terms, since T∆S = (K) (J/K) = J.Now let us consider how ∆G is related to reaction spontaneity.Unit 5.indd   1609/12/2022   11:53:48 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         161We know, ∆Stotal = ∆Ssys +  ∆Ssurr   If the system is in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding, then the temperature of the surrounding is same as that of the system. \nAlso, increase in enthalpy of the surrounding \nis equal to decrease in the enthalpy of the system.Therefore, entropy change of surroundings, \u001f\u001f\u001fSsurr=HTHTsurrsys\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001f\u001fSStotalsys\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016HTsysRearranging the above equation:T∆Stotal  = T∆Ssys – ∆HsysFor spontaneous process, \u001fStotal\u001e0, so              T∆Ssys – ∆Hsys \u003e Ο\u001f\u001e\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001aHTSsyssys0Using equation 5.21, the above equation can be written as–∆G \u003e O\u001f\u001f\u001fGHTS\u001e\u001d\u001c0                                  (5.22)∆Hsys is the enthalpy change of a reaction, T∆Ssys is the energy which is not available to do useful work. So ∆G is the net energy available to do useful work and is thus a measure of the ‘free energy’. For this reason, it is also known as the free energy of the reaction.∆G gives a criteria for spontaneity at constant pressure and temperature.(i) If ∆G is negative (\u003c 0), the process is spontaneous.(ii) If ∆G is positive (\u003e 0), the process is non spontaneous.Note : If a reaction has a positive enthalpy change and positive entropy change, it can be spontaneous when T∆S is large enough to \noutweigh ∆H. This can happen in two ways;  (a) The positive entropy change of the system \ncan be ‘small’ in which case T must be large. (b) The positive entropy change of the \nsystem can be ‘large’, in which case T may be small. The former is one of the reasons \nwhy reactions are often carried out at high \ntemperature. Table 5.4 summarises the effect \nof temperature on spontaneity of reactions.(d) Entropy and Second Law of ThermodynamicsWe know that for an isolated system \nthe change in energy remains constant. Therefore, increase in entropy in such \nsystems is the natural direction of a \nspontaneous change. This, in fact is the �second law of thermodynamics. Like first \nlaw of thermodynamics, second law can also \nbe stated in several ways. The second law of \nthermodynamics explains why spontaneous \nexothermic reactions are so common. \nIn exothermic reactions heat released \nby the reaction increases the disorder \nof the surroundings and overall entropy \nchange is positive which makes the reaction \nspontaneous.(e) Absolute Entropy and Third Law of Thermodynamics Molecules of a substance may move in a straight line in any direction, they may \nspin like a top and the bonds in the \nmolecules may stretch and compress. \nThese motions of the molecule are called \ntranslational, rotational and vibrational \nmotion respectively. When temperature of \nthe system rises, these motions become \nmore vigorous and entropy increases. On the \nother hand when temperature is lowered, the \nentropy decreases. The entropy of any pure crystalline substance approaches zero as �the temperature approaches absolute zero. �This is called third law of thermodynamics. \nThis is so because there is perfect order in \na crystal at absolute zero. The statement is �confined to pure crystalline solids because \ntheoretical arguments and practical evidences \nhave shown that entropy of solutions and \nsuper cooled liquids is not zero at 0 K. The \nimportance of the third law lies in the fact that it permits the calculation of absolute values \nof entropy of pure substance from thermal \ndata alone. For a pure substance, this can Unit 5.indd   1619/12/2022   11:53:49 AM162Table 5.4  Effect of Temperature on Spontaneity of Reactions∆rH ∆rS      ∆rG Description*– + – Reaction spontaneous at all temperatures– – – (at low T ) Reaction spontaneous at low temperature– – + (at high T ) Reaction nonspontaneous at high temperature+ + + (at low T ) Reaction nonspontaneous at low temperature+ + – (at high T ) Reaction spontaneous at high temperature+ – + (at all T ) Reaction nonspontaneous at all temperatures* The term low temperature and high temperature are relative.

Standard entropies can be used to calculate standard entropy changes by a \nHesss law type of calculation. 5.7 GIBBS ENERGY CHANGE AND EQUILIBRIUMWe have seen how a knowledge of the sign and magnitude of the free energy change of a \nchemical reaction allows:(i) Prediction of the spontaneity of the chemical reaction.(ii) Prediction of the useful work that could be extracted from it.So far we have considered free energy changes in irreversible reactions. Let us now examine the free energy changes in reversible \nreactions.‘Reversible’ under strict thermodynamic sense is a special way of carrying out \na process such that system is at all \ntimes in perfect equilibrium with its \nsurroundings. When applied to a chemical \nreaction, the term ‘reversible’ indicates \nthat a given reaction can proceed in either \ndirection simultaneously, so that a dynamic \nequilibrium is set up. This means that the \nreactions in both the directions should proceed with a decrease in free energy, which seems impossible. It is possible only if at \nequilibrium the free energy of the system is minimum.

In such a case, value of K will be much smaller  than 1 and the reaction is unlikely to form much product. In case of exothermic \nreactions, ∆rH is large and negative, and ∆rG is likely to be large and negative too. In such \ncases, K will be much larger than 1. We may expect strongly exothermic reactions to have a \nlarge K, and hence can go to near completion. ∆rG also depends upon ∆rS, if the changes in the entropy of reaction is also taken into \naccount, the value of K or extent of chemical \nreaction will also be affected, depending upon \nwhether ∆rS is positive or negative.Using equation (5.24),Unit 5.indd   1629/12/2022   11:53:49 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         163(i) It is possible to obtain an estimate of ∆G from the measurement of ∆H and ∆S,  and then calculate K at any temperature for economic yields of the products.(ii) If K is measured directly in the laboratory, value of ∆G at any other temperature can be calculated.Using equation (5.24),= –...13610230383142983\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001dJmolJKmolK–1–1–1  =   2.38Hence K = antilog  2.38 = 2.4 × 102.Problem 5.14At 60°C, dinitrogen tetroxide is 50 per cent dissociated.

For these purposes, we divide \nthe universe into the system and the surroundings. Chemical or physical processes lead to evolution \nor absorption of heat (q), part of which may be converted into work (w). These quantities are related \nthrough the first law of thermodynamics via ∆U = q + w. ∆U,  change in internal energy, depends on initial and final states only and is a state function, whereas q and w depend on the path and are not the state functions. We follow sign conventions of q and w by giving the positive sign to these quantities when these are added to the system. We can measure the transfer of heat from one \nsystem to another which causes the change in temperature. The magnitude of rise in temperature \ndepends on the heat capacity (C) of a substance. Therefore, heat absorbed or evolved is q =  C∆T. Work can be measured by w = –pex∆V, in case of expansion of gases. Under reversible process, we can put pex = p for infinitesimal changes in the volume making wrev = – p dV. In this condition, we can use gas equation, pV = nRT.At constant volume, w = 0, then ∆U = qV , heat transfer at constant volume. But in study of chemical reactions, we usually have constant pressure. We define another state function enthalpy. Enthalpy change, ∆H = ∆U + ∆ngRT, can be found directly from the heat changes at constant pressure, ∆H = qp.There are varieties of enthalpy changes. Changes of phase such as melting, vaporization and sublimation usually occur at constant temperature and can be characterized by enthalpy changes which are always positive. Enthalpy of formation, combustion and other enthalpy changes can be \ncalculated using Hess’s law. Enthalpy change for chemical reactions can be determined by\u001f\u001f\u001frifififHaHbH\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001d\u001c\u001a\u001aproductsreactionsand in gaseous state by∆rH =  Σ bond enthalpies of the reactants – Σ bond enthalpies of the productsFirst law of thermodynamics does not guide us about the direction of chemical reactions i.e., what is the driving force of a chemical reaction. For isolated systems,  ∆U = 0. We define another state function, S, entropy for this purpose. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness. For a spontaneous change, total entropy change is positive. Therefore, for an isolated system, ∆U = 0, ∆S \u003e 0, so entropy change distinguishes a spontaneous change, while energy change does not. Entropy changes can be measured by the equation ∆S = qrevT for a reversible process. qrevT is independent of path.Chemical reactions are generally carried at constant pressure, so we define another state function Gibbs energy, G, which is related to entropy and enthalpy changes of the system by the equation:∆rG = ∆rH – T ∆rSFor a spontaneous change, ∆Gsys \u003c 0 and at equilibrium, ∆Gsys = 0.Standard Gibbs energy change is related to equilibrium constant by∆rG = – RT ln K.K can be calculated from this equation, if we know ∆rG which can be found from . Temperature is an important factor in the equation. Many reactions which are non-spontaneous at low temperature, are made spontaneous at high temperature for systems having positive entropy of reaction.Unit 5.indd   1649/12/2022   11:53:50 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         165EXERCISES5.1 Choose the correct answer.

According to them, the continued \nsubdivisions of matter would ultimately yield atoms \nwhich would not be further divisible. The word ‘atom’  \nhas been derived from the Greek word ‘a-tomio’ which means ‘uncut-able’ or ‘non-divisible’. These earlier ideas \nwere mere speculations and there was no way to test \nthem experimentally. These ideas remained dormant  for \na very long time and were revived again by scientists in \nthe nineteenth century.The atomic theory of matter was first proposed on\ta\tfirm\tscientific\tbasis\tby\tJohn\tDalton,\ta\tBritish\tschool teacher in 1808. His theory, called Dalton’s atomic theory, regarded the atom as the ultimate �particle\tof\tmatter\t(Unit\t1).\tDalton’s\tatomic\ttheory\twas\table to explain the law of conservation of mass, law of \nconstant composition and law of multiple proportion very successfully. However, it failed to explain the results \nof many experiments, for example, it was known that \nsubstances like glass or ebonite when rubbed with silk \nor fur get electrically charged.In this unit we start with the experimental observations made by scientists towards the end of nineteenth and \nbeginning of twentieth century. These established that \natoms are made of sub-atomic particles, i.e., electrons,  \nprotons and neutrons — a concept very different from �that\tof\tDalton.\tObjectivesUnit 2.indd   299/9/2022   4:28:07 PM302.1 DISCOVERY OF SUB-ATOMIC PARTICLESAn insight into the structure of atom was obtained from the experiments on electrical \ndischarge through gases. Before we discuss these results we need to keep in mind a \nbasic rule regarding the behaviour of charged \nparticles : “Like charges repel each other and \nunlike charges attract each other”. 2.1.1 Discovery of Electron In 1830, Michael Faraday showed that if electricity is passed through a solution of an electrolyte, chemical reactions occurred at the \nelectrodes, which resulted in the liberation \nand deposition of matter at the electrodes. \nHe formulated certain laws which you will \nstudy in Class XII. These results suggested \nthe particulate nature of electricity.In mid 1850s many scientists mainly Faraday began to study electrical discharge in partially evacuated tubes, known as \ncathode ray discharge tubes. It is depicted \nin Fig. 2.1. A cathode ray tube is made of \nglass containing two thin pieces of metal, \ncalled electrodes, sealed in it. The electrical \ndischarge through the gases could be \nobserved only at very low pressures and at \nvery high voltages. The pressure of different \ngases could be adjusted by evacuation of the �glass\ttubes.\tWhen\tsufficiently\thigh\tvoltage\tis applied across the electrodes, current �starts\tflowing\tthrough\ta\tstream\tof\tparticles\tmoving in the tube from the negative \nelectrode (cathode) to the positive electrode (anode). These were called cathode rays or \ncathode ray particles.\tThe\tflow\tof\tcurrent\tfrom cathode to anode was further checked \nby making a hole in the anode and coating \nthe tube behind anode with phosphorescent \nmaterial zinc sulphide. When these rays, after passing through anode, strike the zinc \nsulphide coating, a bright spot is developed \non the coating [Fig. 2.1(b)]. Fig. 2.1(a) A cathode ray discharge tubeFig. 2.1(b)  A cathode ray discharge tube with perforated anodeThe results of these experiments are summarised below.(i) The cathode rays start from cathode and move towards the anode.(ii) These rays themselves are not visible \nbut their behaviour can be observed \nwith the help of certain kind of materials �(fluorescent\tor\tphosphorescent)\twhich\tglow when hit by them. Television \npicture tubes are cathode ray tubes \nand television pictures result due to fluorescence\ton\tthe\ttelevision\tscreen\tcoated with certain fluorescent or \nphosphorescent materials.(iii) In the absence of electrical or magnetic �field,\tthese\trays\ttravel\tin\tstraight\tlines\t(Fig. 2.2).(iv) In the presence of electrical or magnetic �field,\tthe\tbehaviour\tof\tcathode\trays\tare\tsimilar to that expected from negatively \ncharged particles, suggesting that \nthe cathode rays consist of negatively charged particles, called electrons.(v) The characteristics of cathode rays \n(electrons) do not depend upon the Unit 2.indd   309/9/2022   4:28:08 PM31material of electrodes and the nature of the gas present in the cathode ray tube. Thus, we can conclude that electrons are \nbasic constituent of all the atoms.2.1.2 Charge to Mass Ratio of ElectronIn\t1897,\tBritish\tphysicist\tJ.J.\tThomson\tmeasured the ratio of electrical charge (e) to the mass of electron (me ) by using cathode ray tube and applying electrical and magnetic �field\tperpendicular\tto\teach\tother\tas\twell\tas\tto the path of electrons (Fig. 2.2). When only �electric\tfield\tis\tapplied,\tthe\telectrons\tdeviate\tfrom their path and hit the cathode ray tube \nat point A (Fig. 2.2). Similarly when only �magnetic\tfield\tis\tapplied,\telectron\tstrikes\tthe cathode ray tube at point C. By carefully �balancing\tthe\telectrical\tand\tmagnetic\tfield\tstrength, it is possible to bring back the \nelectron to the path which is followed in the �absence\tof\telectric\tor\tmagnetic\tfield\tand\tthey\thit the screen at point B. Thomson argued \nthat the amount of deviation of the particles \nfrom their path in the presence of electrical or\tmagnetic\tfield\tdepends\tupon:(i) the magnitude of the negative charge on the particle, greater the magnitude of \nthe charge on the particle, greater is the \ninteraction with the electric or magnetic field\tand\tthus\tgreater\tis\tthe\tdeflection.(ii) the mass of the particle — lighter the particle,\tgreater\tthe\tdeflection.(iii) the strength of the electrical or magnetic field\t—\tthe\tdeflection\tof\telectrons\tfrom\tits\toriginal path increases with the increase in the voltage across the electrodes, or �the\tstrength\tof\tthe\tmagnetic\tfield.By carrying out accurate measurements on\tthe\tamount\tof\tdeflections\tobserved\tby\tthe\telectrons\ton\tthe\telectric\tfield\tstrength\tor\tmagnetic\tfield\tstrength,\tThomson\twas\table\tto\tdetermine the value of e/me as: = 1.758820 × 1011 C kg–1                  (2.1)Where me is the mass of the electron in kg and e is the magnitude of the charge on the electron in coulomb (C). Since electrons are negatively charged, the charge on electron \nis –e.2.1.3 Charge on the ElectronR.A. Millikan (1868-1953) devised a method known as oil drop experiment (1906-14), to determine the charge on the electrons. \nHe found the charge on the electron to be  – 1.6 × 10–19 C. The present accepted value of electrical charge is – 1.602176 × 10–19 C. The mass of the  electron (me) was determined by combining these results with Thomson’s value \nof e/me ratio.= 9.1094×10–31 kg                             (2.2)Fig. 2.2 The apparatus to determine the charge to the mass ratio of electronUnit 2.indd   319/9/2022   4:28:08 PM322.1.4 Discovery of Protons and NeutronsElectrical\tdischarge\tcarried\tout\tin\tthe\tmodified\tcathode ray tube led to the discovery of canal rays carrying positively charged particles. The \ncharacteristics of these positively charged particles are listed below.(i) Unlike cathode rays, mass of positively charged particles depends upon the \nnature of gas present in the cathode \nray tube. These are simply the positively charged gaseous ions. (ii) The charge to mass ratio of the particles depends on the gas from which these \noriginate.(iii) Some of the positively charged particles \ncarry a multiple of the fundamental unit \nof electrical charge.(iv) The behaviour of these particles in the �magnetic\tor\telectrical\tfield\tis\topposite\tto that observed for electron or cathode \nrays.The smallest and lightest positive ion was obtained from hydrogen and was called \nproton. This positively charged particle was  characterised in 1919. Later, a need was felt \nfor the presence of electrically neutral particle \nas one of the constituent of atom. These \nparticles were discovered by Chadwick (1932) \nby bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium \nby α-particles. When electrically neutral particles having a mass slightly greater than \nthat of protons were emitted. He named \nthese particles as neutrons. The important properties of all these fundamental particles \nare given in Table 2.1.2.2 ATOMIC MODELSObservations obtained from the experiments mentioned in the previous sections have suggested\tthat\tDalton’s\tindivisible\tatom\tis\tcomposed of sub-atomic particles carrying positive and negative charges. The major problems before the scientists after the \ndiscovery of sub-atomic particles were:•\tto account for the stability of atom,•\tto compare the behaviour of elements in terms of both physical and chemical \nproperties,Millikan’s Oil Drop MethodIn this method, oil droplets in the form of mist, produced by the atomiser, were allowed \nto enter through a tiny hole in the upper \nplate of electrical condenser. The downward \nmotion of these droplets was viewed through \nthe telescope, equipped with a micrometer \neye piece. By measuring the rate of fall of \nthese droplets, Millikan was able to measure \nthe mass of oil droplets. The air inside the \nchamber was ionized by passing a beam of  \nX-rays through it. The electrical charge on \nthese oil droplets was acquired by collisions \nwith gaseous ions. The fall of these charged \noil droplets can be retarded, accelerated or \nmade stationary depending upon the charge \non the droplets and the polarity and strength \nof the voltage applied to the plate. By \ncarefully measuring the effects of electrical �field\tstrength\ton\tthe\tmotion\tof\toil\tdroplets,\tMillikan concluded that the magnitude of \nelectrical charge, q, on the droplets is always an integral multiple of the electrical charge, \ne, that is, q = n e, where n = 1, 2, 3... .•\tto explain the formation of different kinds of molecules by the combination of \ndifferent atoms and, •\tto understand the origin and nature of \nthe characteristics of electromagnetic \nradiation absorbed or emitted by atoms.Fig. 2.3 The Millikan oil drop apparatus for \nmeasuring charge ‘e’. In chamber, \nthe forces acting on oil drop are: gravitational, electrostatic due to �electrical field and a viscous drag \nforce when the oil drop is moving.Unit 2.indd   329/9/2022   4:28:08 PM33Different\tatomic\tmodels\twere\tproposed\tto explain the distributions of these charged particles in an atom. Although some of these \nmodels were not able to explain the stability \nof atoms, two of these models, one proposed by\tJ.J.\tThomson\tand\tthe\tother\tproposed\tby\tErnest Rutherford are discussed below.2.2.1 Thomson Model of AtomJ.\tJ.\tThomson,\tin\t1898,\tproposed\tthat\tan\tatom possesses a spherical shape (radius approximately 10–10 m) in which the positive charge is uniformly distributed. The electrons are embedded into it in such a manner as to \ngive the most stable electrostatic arrangement \n(Fig. 2.4). Many different names are given \nto this model, for example, plum pudding, \nraisin pudding or watermelon. This model In the later half of the nineteenth century different kinds of rays were discovered, \nbesides those mentioned earlier. Wilhalm \nRöentgen (1845-1923) in 1895 showed \nthat when electrons strike a material in \nthe cathode ray tubes, produce rays which �can\tcause\tfluorescence\tin\tthe\tfluorescent\tmaterials placed outside the cathode ray \ntubes. Since Röentgen did not know the \nnature of the radiation, he named them \nX-rays and the name is still carried on. It was \nnoticed that X-rays are produced effectively \nwhen electrons strike the dense metal anode, called\ttargets.\tThese\tare\tnot\tdeflected\tby\tthe\telectric\tand\tmagnetic\tfields\tand\thave\ta\tvery\thigh penetrating power through the matter \nand that is the reason that these rays are used to study the interior of the objects. \nThese rays are of very short wavelengths \n(∼0.1 nm) and possess electro-magnetic character (Section 2.3.1).Henri Becqueral (1852-1908) observed that there are certain elements which emit \nradiation on their own and named this \nphenomenon as  radioactivity and the elements known as radioactive elements. �This\tfield\twas\tdeveloped\tby\tMarie\tCurie,\tPiere Curie, Rutherford and Fredrick Soddy. \nIt was observed that three kinds of rays i.e., �α, β- and γ-rays are emitted. Rutherford found that α-rays consists of high energy particles carrying two units of positive charge \nand four unit of atomic mass. He concluded \nthat α- particles are helium nuclei as when α- particles combined with two electrons yielded \nhelium gas. β-rays are negatively chargedFig.2.4 Thomson model of atomcan be visualised as a pudding or watermelon of positive charge with plums or seeds \n(electrons) embedded into it. An important \nfeature of this model is that the mass of the \natom is assumed to be uniformly distributed \nover the atom. Although this model was able \nto explain the overall neutrality of the atom, \nbut was not consistent with the results of later \nexperiments. Thomson was awarded Nobel \nPrize for physics in 1906, for his theoretical \nand experimental investigations on the \nconduction of electricity by gases.Table 2.1  Properties of Fundamental Particles NameSymbolAbsolute charge/CRelative chargeMass/kgMass/uApprox. mass/uElectronProton\nNeutronepn– 1.602176×10–19+ 1.602176×10–190–1+109.109382×10–311.6726216×10–271.674927×10–270.00054\n1.00727\n1.008670\n1\n1Unit 2.indd   339/9/2022   4:28:08 PM34represented in Fig. 2.5. A stream of high energy α–particles from a radioactive source was directed at a thin foil (thickness ∼ 100 nm) of gold metal. The thin gold foil had a circular �fluorescent\tzinc\tsulphide\tscreen\taround\tit.\tWhenever α–particles struck the screen, a tiny\tflash\tof\tlight\twas\tproduced\tat\tthat\tpoint.The results of scattering experiment were quite unexpected. According to Thomson model of atom, the mass of each gold atom in the foil should have been spread evenly \nover the entire atom, and α–particles had enough energy to pass directly through such a \nuniform distribution of mass. It was expected \nthat the particles would slow down and \nchange directions only by a small angles as \nthey passed through the foil. It was observed \nthat:(i) most of the α–particles passed through �the\tgold\tfoil\tundeflected.(ii) a small fraction of the α–particles was �deflected\tby\tsmall\tangles.(iii) a very few α–particles (∼1 in 20,000) bounced\tback,\tthat\tis,\twere\tdeflected\tby\tnearly 180°. On the basis of the observations, Rutherford drew the following conclusions \nregarding the structure of atom:(i) Most of the space in the atom is empty as most of the α–particles passed through the\tfoil\tundeflected.(ii) A few positively charged α–particles were deflected.\tThe\tdeflection\tmust\tbe\tdue\tto enormous repulsive force showing \nthat the positive charge of the atom \nis not spread throughout the atom as Thomson had presumed. The positive \ncharge has to be concentrated in a very �small\tvolume\tthat\trepelled\tand\tdeflected\tthe positively charged α–particles. (iii) Calculations by Rutherford showed that \nthe volume occupied by the nucleus is negligibly small as compared to the \ntotal volume of the atom. The radius of \nthe atom is about 10–10 m, while that of nucleus is 10–15 m. One can appreciate this difference in size by realising that if Fig. 2.5 Schematic view of Rutherford’s scattering experiment. When a beam of alpha () particles is “shot” at a thin \ngold foil, most of them pass through \nwithout much effect. Some, however, �are deflected.A. Rutherford’s scattering experimentB. Schematic molecular view of the gold foil2.2.2 Rutherford’s Nuclear Model of AtomRutherford and his students (Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden) bombarded very thin \ngold foil with α–particles. Rutherford’s famous  –particle scattering experiment is particles similar to electrons. The γ-rays are high energy radiations like X-rays, are neutral in nature and do not consist of \nparticles. As regards penetrating power, �α-particles are the least, followed by β-rays \n(100 times that of α–particles) and γ-rays (1000 times of that α-particles).Unit 2.indd   349/9/2022   4:28:08 PM35a cricket ball represents a nucleus, then the radius of atom would be about 5 km.On the basis of above observations and conclusions, Rutherford proposed the nuclear model of atom. According to this model:(i) The positive charge and most of the mass of the atom was densely concentrated in \nextremely small region. This very small \nportion of the atom was called nucleus by Rutherford. (ii)  The nucleus is surrounded by electrons \nthat move around the nucleus with a \nvery high speed in circular paths called \norbits. Thus, Rutherford’s model of atom resembles the solar system in which the \nnucleus plays the role of sun and the \nelectrons that of revolving planets.(iii)  Electrons and the nucleus are held together by electrostatic forces of attraction.2.2.3 Atomic Number and Mass NumberThe presence of positive charge on the nucleus is due to the protons in the nucleus. As established earlier, the charge on the proton \nis equal but opposite to that of electron. The \nnumber of protons present in the nucleus is \nequal to atomic number (Z ). For example, the number of protons in the hydrogen nucleus \nis 1, in sodium atom it is 11, therefore their \natomic numbers are 1 and 11 respectively. \nIn order to keep the electrical neutrality,  \nthe number of electrons in an atom is equal \nto the number of protons (atomic number, \nZ ). For example, number of electrons in hydrogen atom and sodium atom are 1 and \n11 respectively.Atomic number (Z) = number of protons in              the nucleus of an atom      =  number of electrons          in a nuetral atom   (2.3)While the positive charge of the nucleus is due to protons, the mass of the nucleus,  due to protons and neutrons. As discussed earlier protons and neutrons present in the \nnucleus are collectively known as nucleons. The total number of nucleons is termed as mass number (A) of the atom. mass number (A) = number of protons (Z)                         + number of           neutrons (n)           (2.4)2.2.4 Isobars and IsotopesThe composition of any atom can be represented by using the normal element \nsymbol (X) with super-script on the left hand \nside as the atomic mass number (A) and \nsubscript (Z) on the left hand side as the atomic number (i.e., AZ X).Isobars are the atoms with same mass number but different atomic number for example, 614C and 714N. On the other hand, atoms with identical atomic number but \ndifferent atomic mass number are known \nas Isotopes. In other words (according to equation 2.4), it is evident that difference \nbetween the isotopes is due to the presence \nof different number of neutrons present in \nthe nucleus. For example, considering of \nhydrogen atom again, 99.985% of hydrogen \natoms contain only one proton. This isotope is \ncalled protium (11H). Rest of the percentage of hydrogen atom contains two other isotopes, \nthe one containing 1 proton and 1 neutron \nis called deuterium (12D, 0.015%) and the other one possessing 1 proton and 2 neutrons \nis called tritium (13T ). The latter isotope is found in trace amounts on the earth. Other \nexamples of commonly occuring isotopes are: \ncarbon atoms containing 6, 7 and 8 neutrons \nbesides 6 protons (612613614C,C,C); chlorine atoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons besides \n17 protons (17351737Cl,Cl).Lastly an important point to mention regarding isotopes is that chemical properties of atoms are controlled by the number of \nelectrons, which are determined by the number \nof protons in the nucleus. Number of neutrons \npresent in the nucleus have very little effect \non the chemical properties of an element. \nTherefore, all the isotopes of a given element \nshow same chemical behaviour.Unit 2.indd   359/9/2022   4:28:09 PM36Problem 2.1 Calculate the number of protons, neutrons and electrons in 8035Br.SolutionIn this case, 8035Br, Z = 35, A = 80, species is neutralNumber of protons = number of electrons = Z = 35Number of neutrons = 80 – 35 = 45, (equation 2.4)Problem 2.2 The number of electrons, protons and neutrons in a species are equal to 18, 16 \nand 16 respectively. Assign the proper \nsymbol to the species.SolutionThe atomic number is equal to  number of protons = 16. The element is \nsulphur (S).Atomic mass number = number of protons + number of neutrons= 16 + 16 = 32\nSpecies is not neutral as the number of protons is not equal to electrons. It is \nanion (negatively charged) with charge \nequal to excess electrons = 18 – 16 = 2. \nSymbol is .Note : Before using the notation AZ X, find\tout\twhether\tthe\tspecies\tis\ta\tneutral\tatom, a cation or an anion. If it is a \nneutral atom, equation (2.3) is valid, i.e., \nnumber of protons = number of electrons = atomic number. If the species is an \nion, determine whether the number of \nprotons are larger (cation, positive ion) \nor smaller (anion, negative ion) than the \nnumber of electrons. Number of neutrons \nis always given by A–Z, whether the \nspecies is neutral or ion.2.2.5 Drawbacks of Rutherford ModelAs you have learnt above, Rutherford nuclear model of an atom is like a small scale solar \nsystem with the nucleus playing the role * Classical mechanics is a theoretical science based on Newton’s laws of motion. It specifies the laws of motion of macroscopic \nobjects.of the massive sun and the electrons being similar to the lighter planets. When classical \nmechanics* is applied to the solar system, it �shows\tthat\tthe\tplanets\tdescribe\twell-defined\torbits around the sun. The gravitational force between the planets is given by the expression G.122mmr\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a where m1 and m2 are the masses, r is the distance of separation of the masses and G is the gravitational constant. The theory \ncan also calculate precisely the planetary \norbits and these are in agreement with the \nexperimental measurements.The similarity between the solar system and nuclear model suggests that electrons \nshould move around the nucleus in well �defined\torbits.\tFurther,\tthe\tcoulomb\tforce\t(kq1q2/r2 where q1 and q2 are the charges, r is the distance of separation of the charges \nand k is the proportionality constant) between \nelectron and the nucleus is mathematically \nsimilar to the gravitational force. However, \nwhen a body is moving in an orbit, it \nundergoes acceleration even if it is moving \nwith a constant speed in an orbit because \nof changing direction. So an electron in the \nnuclear model describing planet like orbits \nis under acceleration. According to the \nelectromagnetic theory of Maxwell, charged \nparticles when accelerated should emit \nelectromagnetic radiation (This feature does \nnot exist for planets since they are uncharged). \nTherefore, an electron in an orbit will emit \nradiation, the energy carried by radiation comes from electronic motion. The orbit will \nthus continue to shrink. Calculations show \nthat it should take an electron only 10–8 s to spiral into the nucleus. But this does \nnot happen. Thus, the Rutherford model  cannot explain the stability of an atom.  If the motion of an electron is described on \nthe basis of the classical mechanics and \nelectromagnetic theory, you may ask that  since the motion of electrons in orbits is  leading to the instability of the atom, then  why not consider electrons as stationary Unit 2.indd   369/9/2022   4:28:09 PM37around the nucleus. If the electrons were  stationary, electrostatic attraction between  the dense nucleus and the electrons would pull the electrons toward the nucleus to \nform a miniature version of Thomson’s model \nof atom.Another serious drawback of the Rutherford model is that it says nothing \nabout  distribution of the electrons around the \nnucleus and the energies of these electrons.2.3 DEVELOPMENTS LEADING TO THE BOHR’S MODEL OF ATOMHistorically, results observed from the studies of interactions of radiations with matter have provided immense information regarding \nthe structure of atoms and molecules. Neils \nBohr utilised these results to improve upon \nthe model proposed by Rutherford. Two \ndevelopments played a major role in the \nformulation of Bohr’s model of atom. These \nwere:(i)\tDual\tcharacter\tof\tthe\telectromagnetic\tradiation which means that radiations possess both wave like and particle like \nproperties, and(ii) Experimental results regarding atomic \nspectra.First, we will discuss about the duel nature of electromagnetic radiations. Experimental \nresults regarding atomic spectra will be \ndiscussed in Section 2.4.2.3.1 Wave Nature of Electromagnetic   RadiationIn the mid-nineteenth century, physicists actively studied absorption and emission of radiation by heated objects. These are called �thermal\tradiations.\tThey\ttried\tto\tfind\tout\tof\twhat the thermal radiation is made. It is now \na well-known fact that thermal radiations consist of electromagnetic waves of various \nfrequencies or wavelengths. It is based on \na number of modern concepts, which were \nunknown in the mid-nineteenth century. \nFirst active study of thermal radiation laws \noccured in the 1850’s and the theory of \nelectromagnetic waves and the emission of \nsuch waves by accelerating charged particles was\tdeveloped\tin\tthe\tearly\t1870’s\tby\tJames\tClerk Maxwell, which was experimentally confirmed\tlater\tby\tHeinrich\tHertz.\tHere,\twe\twill learn some facts about electromagnetic \nradiations.James\tMaxwell\t(1870)\twas\tthe\tfirst\tto\tgive a comprehensive explanation about the interaction between the charged bodies and \nthe behaviour of electrical and magnetic fields\ton\tmacroscopic\tlevel.\tHe\tsuggested\tthat when electrically charged particle moves \nunder accelaration, alternating electrical and �magnetic\tfields\tare\tproduced\tand\ttransmitted.\tThese\tfields\tare\ttransmitted\tin\tthe\tforms\tof waves called electromagnetic waves or \nelectromagnetic radiation.Light is the form of radiation known from early days and speculation about its nature dates back to remote ancient times. In earlier \ndays (Newton) light was supposed to be made \nof particles (corpuscules). It was only in the \n19th century when wave nature of light was \nestablished.Maxwell\twas\tagain\tthe\tfirst\tto\treveal\tthat\tlight waves are associated with oscillating electric and magnetic character (Fig. 2.6). Although electromagnetic wave motion is complex in nature, we will consider here only \na few simple properties.\n(i)  The oscillating electric and magnetic �fields\tproduced\tby\toscillating\tcharged\tFig.2.6  The electric and magnetic field components of an electromagnetic \nwave. These components have the \nsame wavelength, frequency, speed \nand amplitude, but  they vibrate in two \nmutually perpendicular planes.Unit 2.indd   379/9/2022   4:28:10 PM38particles are perpendicular to each other and both are perpendicular to the \ndirection of propagation of the wave. �Simplified\tpicture\tof\telectromagnetic\twave is shown in Fig. 2.6.(ii)  Unlike sound waves or waves produced  \nin water, electromagnetic waves do \nnot require medium and can move in vacuum. (iii)  It is now well established that there \nare many types of electromagnetic radiations, which differ from one \nanother in wavelength (or frequency). \nThese constitute what is called \nelectromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 2.7). �Different\tregions\tof\tthe\tspectrum\tare\tidentified by different names. Some examples are: radio frequency region \naround 106 Hz, used for broadcasting; microwave region around 1010 Hz used for radar; infrared region around 1013 Hz used for heating; ultraviolet region \naround 1016Hz a component of sun’s radiation. The small portion around 1015 Hz, is what is ordinarily called visible \nlight. It is only this part which our eyes \ncan see (or detect). Special instruments \nare required to detect non-visible \nradiation.(iv)\t\tDifferent\tkinds\tof\tunits\tare\tused\tto\trepresent electromagnetic radiation.These radiations are characterised by the properties, namely, frequency (ν) and wavelength (λ).The SI unit for frequency (ν) is hertz  (Hz, s–1),\tafter\tHeinrich\tHertz.\tIt\tis\tdefined\tas\tthe number of waves that pass a given point in one second.Wavelength should have the units of length and as you know that the SI units of \nlength is meter (m). Since electromagnetic \nradiation consists of different kinds of waves \nof much smaller wavelengths, smaller units \nare used. Fig. 2.7 shows various types of \nelectro-magnetic radiations which differ from \none another in wavelengths and frequencies.In vaccum all types of electromagnetic radiations, regardless of wavelength, travel at the same speed, i.e., 3.0 × 108 m s–1 (2.997925 × 108 ms–1, to be precise). This is called speed of light and is given the symbol ‘c’. The \nfrequency (ν ), wavelength (λ) and velocity of light (c) are related by the equation (2.5). c = ν  λ            (2.5)Fig. 2.7 (a) The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. (b) Visible spectrum. The visible region is only a small part of the entire spectrum.(a)(b)Unit 2.indd   389/9/2022   4:28:10 PM39The other commonly used quantity specially in spectroscopy, is the wavenumber (). It is defined as the number of wavelengths per unit length. Its units are reciprocal of wavelength unit, i.e., m–1. However commonly used unit is cm–1 (not SI unit).Problem 2.3The Vividh Bharati station of All India Radio,\tDelhi,\tbroadcasts\ton\ta\tfrequency\tof 1,368 kHz (kilo hertz). Calculate \nthe wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by transmitter. Which \npart of the electromagnetic spectrum \ndoes it belong to?SolutionThe wavelength, λ, is equal to c/ν, where \nc is the speed of electromagnetic radiation in vacuum and ν is the frequency. Substituting the given values, we have\u001f\u001ecv This is a characteristic radiowave \nwavelength.Problem 2.4The wavelength range of the visible spectrum extends from violet (400 nm) to \nred (750 nm). Express these wavelengths \nin frequencies (Hz).

However, following \nare some of the observations which could \nnot be explained with the help of even the \nelectromagentic theory of 19th century \nphysics (known as classical physics): (i) the nature of emission of radiation from hot bodies (black-body radiation)(ii) ejection of electrons from metal surface \nwhen radiation strikes it (photoelectric effect)(iii) variation of heat capacity of solids as a \nfunction of temperatureUnit 2.indd   399/9/2022   4:28:10 PM40entering\tthe\thole\twill\tbe\treflected\tby\tthe\tcavity\twalls and will be eventually absorbed by the walls. A black body is also a perfect radiator of radiant energy. Furthermore, a black body is \nin thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. \nIt radiates same amount of energy per unit \narea as it absorbs from its surrounding in \nany given time. The amount of light emitted \n(intensity of radiation) from a black body \nand its spectral distribution depends only \non its temperature. At a given temperature, \nintensity of radiation emitted increases \nwith the increase of wavelength, reaches a \nmaximum value at a given wavelength and \nthen starts decreasing with further increase of \nwavelength, as shown in Fig. 2.8. Also, as the \ntemperature increases, maxima of the curve \nshifts to short wavelength. Several attempts \nwere made to predict the intensity of radiation as a function of wavelength.But the results of the above experiment could not be explained satisfactorily on the basis of the wave theory of light. Max \nPlanck arrived at a satisfactory relationship  Fig. 2.8(a) Black body Fig. 2.8 Wavelength-intensity relationship(iv) Line spectra of atoms with special \nreference to hydrogen.These phenomena indicate that the system can take energy only in discrete amounts. All possible energies cannot be taken up or radiated. It\tis\tnoteworthy\tthat\tthe\tfirst\tconcrete\texplanation for the phenomenon of the black body radiation mentioned above was given �by\tMax\tPlanck\tin\t1900.\tLet\tus\tfirst\ttry\tto\tunderstand this phenomenon, which is  given below:Hot objects emit electromagnetic radiations over a wide range of wavelengths. \nAt high temperatures, an appreciable \nproportion of radiation is in the visible \nregion of the spectrum. As the temperature \nis raised, a higher proportion of short \nwavelength (blue light) is generated. For \nexample, when an iron rod is heated in a �furnace,\tit\tfirst\tturns\tto\tdull\tred\tand\tthen\tprogressively becomes more and more red as the temperature increases. As this is \nheated further, the radiation emitted becomes  white and then becomes blue as the \ntemperature becomes very high. This means \nthat red radiation is most intense at a \nparticular temperature and the blue radiation \nis more intense at another temperature. This \nmeans intensities of radiations of different \nwavelengths emitted by hot body depend \nupon its temperature. By late 1850’s it was \nknown that objects made of different material \nand kept at different temperatures emit \ndifferent amount of radiation. Also, when the \nsurface of an object is irradiated with light \n(electromagnetic radiation), a part of radiant �energy\tis\tgenerally\treflected\tas\tsuch,\ta\tpart\tis absorbed and a part of it is transmitted. \nThe reason for incomplete absorption is \nthat ordinary objects are as a rule imperfect \nabsorbers of radiation. An ideal body, which \nemits and absorbs radiations of all frequencies uniformly, is called a black body and the \nradiation emitted by such a body is called \nblack body radiation. In practice, no such \nbody exists. Carbon black approximates \nfairly closely to black body. A good physical  \napproximation to a black body is a cavity with a \ntiny hole, which has no other opening. Any ray Unit 2.indd   409/9/2022   4:28:10 PM41by making an assumption that absorption and emmission of radiation arises from \noscillator i.e., atoms in the wall of black \nbody. Their frequency of oscillation is \nchanged by interaction with oscilators of \nelectromagnetic radiation. Planck assumed \nthat radiation could be sub-divided into \ndiscrete chunks of energy. He suggested that \natoms and molecules could emit or absorb \nenergy only in discrete quantities and not \nin a continuous manner. He gave the name \nquantum to the smallest quantity of energy that can be emitted or absorbed in the form \nof electromagnetic radiation. The energy (E) \nof a quantum of radiation is proportional  to its frequency (ν) and is expressed by equation (2.6).      E = hυ                                              (2.6)The proportionality constant, ‘h’ is known as Planck’s constant and has the value 6.626×10–34 J\ts.\tWith this theory, Planck was able to explain the distribution of intensity in the radiation from black body as a function of frequency or \nwavelength at different temperatures. Quantisation has been compared to standing on a staircase. A person can stand on any step of a staircase, but it is not possible \nfor him/her to stand in between the two steps. \nThe energy can take any one of the values \nfrom the following set, but cannot take on any values between them.E = 0, hυ, 2hυ , 3hυ....nhυ..... Photoelectric EffectIn 1887, H. Hertz performed a very interesting experiment in which electrons (or electric \ncurrent) were ejected when certain metals \n(for example potassium, rubidium, caesium \netc.) were exposed to a beam of light as shown  in Fig. 2.9. The phenomenon is called Photoelectric effect. The results observed in this experiment were: (i) The electrons are ejected from the metal surface as soon as the beam of light \nstrikes the surface, i.e., there is no time \nlag between the striking of light beam and \nthe ejection of electrons from the metal \nsurface.(ii) The number of electrons ejected is \nproportional to the intensity or brightness \nof light. (iii) For each metal, there is a characteristic \nminimum frequency, ν0 (also known as threshold frequency) below which photoelectric effect is not observed. At \na frequency ν \u003eν0, the ejected electrons come out with certain kinetic energy. \nThe kinetic energies of these electrons \nincrease with the increase of frequency \nof the light used.All the above results could not be explained on the basis of laws of classical physics. \nAccording to latter, the energy content of the \nbeam of light depends upon the brightness of \nthe light. In other words, number of electrons \nejected and kinetic energy associated with \nthem should depend on the brightness of light. \nIt has been observed that though the number Fig.2.9  Equipment for studying the photoelectric effect. Light of a particular frequency strikes a clean metal surface inside a \nvacuum chamber. Electrons are ejected \nfrom the metal and are counted by a \ndetector that measures their kinetic \nenergy.Max Planck(1858–1947)Max Planck, a German physicist, \nreceived his Ph.D in theoretical \nphysics from the University of \nMunich in 1879. In 1888, he \nwas appointed Director of the \nInstitute of Theoretical Physics \nat the University of Berlin. Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \nin 1918 for his quantum theory. Planck also made �significant contributions in thermodynamics and \nother areas of physics.Unit 2.indd   419/9/2022   4:28:11 PM42of electrons ejected does depend upon the brightness of light, the kinetic energy of the \nejected electrons does not. For example, red \nlight [ν = (4.3 to 4.6) × 1014 Hz] of any brightness (intensity) may shine on a piece of potassium \nmetal for hours but no photoelectrons are \nejected. But, as soon as even a very weak \nyellow light (ν = 5.1–5.2 × 1014 Hz) shines on the potassium metal, the photoelectric effect \nis observed. The threshold frequency (ν0) for potassium metal is 5.0×1014 Hz. Einstein (1905) was able to explain the photoelectric effect using Planck’s quantum \ntheory of electromagnetic radiation as a \nstarting point. the minimum energy required to eject the electron is hν0 (also called work function, W0; Table 2.2), then the difference in energy  (hν – hν0 ) is transferred as the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. Following the conservation \nof energy principle, the kinetic energy of the \nejected electron is given by the equation 2.7.  (2.7)where me is the mass of the electron and v is the velocity associated with the ejected electron. \nLastly, a more intense beam of light consists \nof larger number of photons, consequently the \nnumber of electrons ejected is also larger as \ncompared to that in an experiment in which a \nbeam of weaker intensity of light is employed. Dual Behaviour of Electromagnetic RadiationThe particle nature of light posed a dilemma for scientists. On the one hand, it could explain \nthe black body radiation and  photoelectric \neffect satisfactorily but on the other hand, \nit was not consistent with the known wave \nbehaviour of light which could account for the \nphenomena of interference and diffraction. \nThe only way to resolve the dilemma was \nto accept the idea that light possesses \nboth particle and wave-like properties, i.e., �light\thas\tdual\tbehaviour.\tDepending\ton\tthe\texperiment,\twe\tfind\tthat\tlight\tbehaves\teither as a wave or as a stream of particles. Whenever radiation interacts with matter, it displays particle like properties in contrast \nto the wavelike properties (interference \nand diffraction), which it exhibits when it \npropagates. This concept was totally alien to \nthe way the scientists thought about matter \nand radiation and it took them a long time to \nbecome convinced of its validity. It turns out, \nas you shall see later, that some microscopic particles like electrons also exhibit this wave-\nparticle duality.Shining a beam of light on to a metal surface can, therefore, be viewed as shooting a beam of particles, the photons. When a �photon\tof\tsufficient\tenergy\tstrikes\tan\telectron\tin the atom of the metal, it transfers its energy instantaneously to the electron during the \ncollision and the electron is ejected without \nany time lag or delay. Greater the energy \npossessed by the photon, greater will be \ntransfer of energy to the electron and greater \nthe kinetic energy of the ejected electron. In \nother words, kinetic energy of the ejected \nelectron is proportional to the frequency \nof the electromagnetic radiation. Since the \nstriking photon has energy equal to hν  and Table 2.2  Values of Work Function (W0) for a Few Metals MetalLiNaKMgCuAgW0 /eV2.422.32.253.74.84.3Albert Einstein, a German born American physicist, is regarded \nby many as one of the two great \nphysicists the world has known �(the other is Isaac Newton).

As a result, the beam of light is deviated or refracted \nfrom its original path as it passes from one \nmedium to another. It is observed that when \na ray of white light is passed through a prism, \nthe wave with shorter wavelength bends more \nthan the one with a longer wavelength. Since \nordinary white light consists of waves with \nall the wavelengths in the visible range, a ray \nof white light is spread out into a series of \ncoloured bands called spectrum. The light of \nred colour which has longest wavelength is \ndeviated the least while the violet light, which \nhas shortest wavelength is deviated the most. \nThe spectrum of white light, that we can \nsee, ranges from violet at 7.50 × 1014 Hz to red at 4×1014 Hz. Such a spectrum is called continuous spectrum. Continuous because \nviolet merges into blue, blue into green and \nso on. A similar spectrum is produced when \na rainbow forms in the sky. Remember that \nvisible light is just a small portion of the \nelectromagnetic radiation (Fig.2.7). When \nelectromagnetic radiation interacts with \nmatter, atoms and molecules may absorb \nenergy and reach to a higher energy state. With \nhigher energy, these are in an unstable state. \nFor returning to their normal (more stable, \nlower energy states) energy state, the atoms \nand molecules emit radiations in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.Emission and Absorption SpectraThe spectrum of radiation emitted by a \nsubstance that has absorbed energy is called \nan emission spectrum. Atoms, molecules or ions that have absorbed radiation are said \nto be “excited”. To produce an emission spectrum, energy is supplied to a sample by \nheating it or irradiating it and the wavelength \n(or frequency) of the radiation emitted, as \nthe sample gives up the absorbed energy, is \nrecorded.An absorption spectrum is like the photographic negative of an emission spectrum. A continuum of radiation is passed through a sample which absorbs radiation of \ncertain wavelengths. The missing wavelength \nwhich corresponds to the radiation absorbed \nby the matter, leave dark spaces in the bright \ncontinuous spectrum.The study of emission or absorption spectra is referred to as spectroscopy. The spectrum of the visible light, as discussed \nabove, was continuous as all wavelengths (red \nto violet) of the visible light are represented in \nthe spectra. The emission spectra of atoms in \nthe gas phase, on the other hand, do not show \na continuous spread of wavelength from red �to\tviolet,\trather\tthey\temit\tlight\tonly\tat\tspecific\twavelengths with dark spaces between them. \nSuch spectra are called line spectra or atomic spectra because the emitted radiation �is\tidentified\tby\tthe\tappearance\tof\tbright\tlines\tin the spectra (Fig. 2.10 page 45).Line emission spectra are of great interest in the study of electronic structure. \nEach element has a unique line emission \nspectrum. The characteristic lines in atomic \nspectra can be used in chemical analysis to \nidentify unknown atoms in the same way �as\tfingerprints\tare\tused\tto\tidentify\tpeople.\tThe exact matching of lines of the emission \nspectrum of the atoms of a known element \nwith the lines from an unknown sample quickly establishes the identity of the latter, \nGerman chemist, Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) �was\tone\tof\tthe\tfirst\tinvestigators\tto\tuse\tline\tspectra to identify elements.Elements like rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs) thallium (Tl), indium (In), gallium (Ga) and \nscandium (Sc) were discovered when their \nminerals were analysed by spectroscopic \nmethods. The element helium (He) was discovered in the sun by spectroscopic method.Line Spectrum of Hydrogen When an electric discharge is passed through gaseous hydrogen, the H2 molecules dissociate and the energetically excited hydrogen atoms \nproduced emit electromagnetic radiation of \ndiscrete frequencies. The hydrogen spectrum \nconsists of several series of lines named after \ntheir discoverers. Balmer showed in 1885 \non the basis of experimental observations * The restriction of any property to discrete values is called quantization.Unit 2.indd   449/9/2022   4:28:11 PM45that if spectral lines are expressed in terms of wavenumber (), then the visible lines of the hydrogen spectrum obey the following formula:         (2.8)where n is an integer equal to or greater than 3 (i.e., n = 3,4,5,....)The series of lines described by this formula are called the Balmer series. The Balmer series of lines are the only lines in the hydrogen spectrum which appear in the visible region \nof the electromagnetic spectrum. The Swedish �spectroscopist,\tJohannes\tRydberg,\tnoted\tthat all series of lines in the hydrogen \nspectrum could be described by the following expression :         (2.9)where n1=1,2........n2 = n1 + 1, n1 + 2......The value 109,677 cm–1 is called the Rydberg constant\tfor\thydrogen.\tThe\tfirst\tfive\tseries of lines that correspond to n1 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are known as Lyman, Balmer, Paschen, Bracket and Pfund series, respectively,  Table 2.3 shows these series of transitions in \nthe hydrogen spectrum. Fig. 2.11 (page, 46) \nshows the Lyman, Balmer and Paschen series \nof transitions for hydrogen atom.Of all the elements, hydrogen atom has the simplest line spectrum. Line spectrum (a)(b)Fig. 2.10 (a) Atomic emission.  The light emitted by a sample of excited hydrogen atoms (or any other element) can be passed through a prism and separated into certain discrete wavelengths. Thus an emission spectrum, which is a photographic recording of the separated wavelengths is called as line spectrum. Any \nsample of reasonable size contains an enormous number of atoms. Although a single atom can be in only \none excited state at a time, the collection of atoms contains all possible excited states. The light emitted as \nthese atoms fall to lower energy states is responsible for the spectrum. (b) Atomic absorption. When white \nlight is passed through unexcited atomic hydrogen and then through a slit and prism, the transmitted light �is lacking in intensity at the same wavelengths as are emitted in (a) The recorded absorption spectrum is \nalso a line spectrum and the photographic negative of the emission spectrum.Table 2.3 The Spectral Lines for Atomic HydrogenSeriesn1n2Spectral RegionLymanBalmer\nPaschen\nBrackett\nPfund1\n2\n3\n4\n52,3....\n3,4....\n4,5....\n5,6....\n6,7....Ultraviolet\nVisible\nInfrared\nInfrared\nInfraredUnit 2.indd   459/9/2022   4:28:12 PM46becomes more and more complex for heavier atom. There are, however, certain features \nwhich are common to all line spectra, i.e., \n(i) line spectrum of element is unique and \n(ii) there is regularity in the line spectrum of \neach element. The questions which arise are: \nWhat are the reasons for these similarities? \nIs it something to do with the electronic \nstructure of atoms?

He used Planck’s concept of quantisation \nof energy. Though the theory is not the \nmodern quantum mechanics, it can still \nbe used to rationalize many points in the Fig. 2.11 Transitions of the electron in the hydrogen atom (The diagram shows the \nLyman, Balmer and Paschen series of �transitions)atomic structure and spectra. Bohr’s model for hydrogen atom is based on the following postulates:i) The electron in the hydrogen atom can move around the nucleus in a circular path\tof\tfixed\tradius\tand\tenergy.\tThese\tpaths are called orbits, stationary states \nor allowed energy states. These orbits \nare arranged concentrically around the \nnucleus.ii) The energy of an electron in the orbit \ndoes not change with time. However, the electron will move from a lower \nstationary state to a higher stationary \nstate when required amount of energy \nis absorbed by the electron or energy is \nemitted when electron moves from higher \nstationary state to lower stationary state \n(equation 2.16). The energy change does \nnot take place in a continuous manner.Angular MomentumJust\tas\tlinear\tmomentum\tis\tthe\tproduct\tof mass (m) and linear velocity (v), angular momentum is the product of moment of \ninertia (I) and angular velocity (ω). For an electron of mass me, moving in a circular path of radius r around the nucleus,   angular momentum = I × ωSince I = mer2, and  ω = v/r where v is the linear velocity, ∴angular momentum =  mer2 × v/r = mevriii) The frequency of radiation absorbed or emitted when transition occurs between two stationary states that differ in energy by ∆E, is given by:                        (2.10) Where E1 and E2 are the energies of the lower and higher allowed energy states respectively. This expression is commonly known as Bohr’s frequency rule.iv) The angular momentum of an electron \nis quantised. In a given stationary state \nit can be expressed as in equation (2.11)   mrnhev\u001f.2\u001e  n = 1,2,3.....        (2.11)Unit 2.indd   469/9/2022   4:28:13 PM47Where me is the mass of electron, v is the velocity and r is the radius of the orbit in which electron is moving.Thus an electron can move only in those orbits for which its angular momentum is integral multiple of h/2π.  That means angular momentum is quantised. Radiation is emitted \nor obsorbed only when transition of electron \ntakes place from one quantised value of \nangular momentum to another. Therefore, \nMaxwell’s electromagnetic theory does not �apply\there\tthat\tis\twhy\tonly\tcertain\tfixed\torbits\tare allowed.The details regarding the derivation of energies of the stationary states used by Bohr, are quite complicated and will be discussed in \nhigher classes. However, according to Bohr’s \ntheory for hydrogen atom:\na) The stationary states for electron are \nnumbered n = 1,2,3.......... These integral numbers (Section 2.6.2) are known as \nPrincipal quantum numbers.b) The radii of the stationary states are expressed as:  rn  = n2 a0                                      (2.12) where a0 = 52.9 pm. Thus the radius of the\tfirst\tstationary\tstate,\tcalled\tthe\tBohr orbit, is 52.9 pm. Normally the electron \nin the hydrogen atom is found in this \norbit (that is n=1). As n increases the value of r will increase. In other words \nthe electron will be present away from \nthe nucleus.c) The most important property associated \nwith the electron, is the energy of its \nstationary state. It is given by the expression.EnnH\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018R12     n = 1,2,3....          (2.13)where RH is called Rydberg constant and its value is 2.18×10–18\tJ.\tThe\tenergy\tof\tthe\tlowest state, also called as the ground state, is  E1 = –2.18×10–18 (112) = –2.18×10–18 J.\tThe\tenergy of the stationary state for n = 2, willbe : E2 = –2.18×10–18J\t(122) = –0.545×10–18 J.\tFig. 2.11 depicts the energies of different stationary states or energy levels of hydrogen \natom. This representation is called an energy \nlevel diagram.When\tthe\telectron\tis\tfree\tfrom\tthe\tinfluence\tof nucleus, the energy is taken as zero. The \nelectron in this situation is associated with the stationary state of Principal Quantum number \n= n = ∞ and is called as ionized hydrogen atom. When the electron is attracted by the nucleus and is present in orbit n, the energy is emitted and its energy is lowered. That is the reason What does the negative electronic energy (En) for hydrogen atom mean?The energy of the electron in a hydrogen atom has a negative sign for all possible orbits (eq. 2.13). What does this negative \nsign convey? This negative sign means \nthat the energy of the electron in the \natom is lower than the energy of a free \nelectron at rest. A free electron at rest �is\tan\telectron\tthat\tis\tinfinitely\tfar\taway\tfrom the nucleus and is assigned the \nenergy value of zero. Mathematically, this �corresponds\tto\tsetting\tn\tequal\tto\tinfinity\tin the equation (2.13) so that E∞=0. As the electron gets closer to the nucleus (as n \ndecreases), En becomes larger in absolute value and more and more negative. The \nmost negative energy value is given by \nn=1 which corresponds to the most stable orbit. We call this the ground state.Niels Bohr(1885–1962)Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist \nreceived his Ph.D. from the \nUniversity of Copenhagen in �1911. He then spent a year \nwith J.J. Thomson and Ernest \nRutherford in England. In 1913, he returned to Copenhagen where he remained for �the rest of his life. In 1920 he was named Director �of the Institute of theoretical Physics. After first \nWorld War, Bohr worked energetically for peaceful �uses of atomic energy. He received the first Atoms \nfor Peace award in 1957. Bohr was awarded the �Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922.Unit 2.indd   479/9/2022   4:28:13 PM48for the presence of negative sign in equation (2.13) and depicts its stability relative to the \nreference state of zero energy and n = ∞.d) Bohr’s theory can also be applied to the ions containing only one electron, similar to that present in hydrogen \natom. For example, He+ Li2+, Be3+ and so on. The energies of the stationary states \nassociated with these kinds of ions (also \nknown as hydrogen like species) are given by the expression.

From the above equations, it is \nevident that the value of energy becomes more \nnegative and that of radius becomes smaller \nwith increase of Z. This means that electron will be tightly bound to the nucleus.e) It is also possible to calculate the velocities of electrons moving in these orbits. Although the precise equation \nis not given here, qualitatively the \nmagnitude of velocity of electron \nincreases with increase of positive \ncharge on the nucleus and decreases \nwith increase of principal quantum number.2.4.1 Explanation of Line Spectrum of   HydrogenLine spectrum observed in case of hydrogen atom, as mentioned in section 2.3.3, can be explained quantitatively using Bohr’s model. \nAccording to assumption 2, radiation (energy) \nis absorbed if the electron moves from the \norbit of smaller Principal quantum number to \nthe orbit of higher Principal quantum number, \nwhereas the radiation (energy) is emitted if \nthe electron moves from higher orbit to lower \norbit. The energy gap between the two orbits is given by equation (2.16)∆E = Ef – Ei                                      (2.16)Combining equations (2.13) and (2.16)\u001fEnn\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001d\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017RRHfHi22 (where ni and nf stand\tfor\tinitial\torbit\tand\tfinal\torbits) ∆E\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001f\u0017\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001eRJHifif112181011221822nnnn.

However, Bohr’s model was too simple to account for the following points.i)\tIt\tfails\tto\taccount\tfor\tthe\tfiner\tdetails\t(doublet, that is two closely spaced lines) of the hydrogen atom spectrum observed \nby using sophisticated spectroscopic techniques. This model is also unable \nto explain the spectrum of atoms \nother than hydrogen, for example, \nhelium atom which possesses only two \nelectrons. Further, Bohr’s theory was \nalso unable to explain the splitting \nof spectral lines in the presence of \nmagnetic field (Zeeman effect) or an �electric\tfield\t(Stark\teffect).ii) It could not explain the ability of atoms \nto form molecules by chemical bonds.In other words, taking into account the points mentioned above, one needs a better \ntheory which can explain the salient features of the structure of complex atoms.2.5 TOWARDS QUANTUM MECHANICAL MODEL OF THE ATOMIn view of the shortcoming of the Bohr’s model, attempts were made to develop a more \nsuitable and general model for atoms. Two \nimportant developments which contributed �significantly\tin\tthe\tformulation\tof\tsuch\ta\tmodel were:1.\t\tDual\tbehaviour\tof\tmatter,\t2.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.2.5.1 Dual Behaviour of MatterThe French physicist, de Broglie, in 1924 proposed that matter, like radiation, should also exhibit dual behaviour i.e., both particle \nand wavelike properties. This means that \njust as the photon has momentum as well \nas wavelength, electrons should also have \nmomentum as well as wavelength, de Broglie, \nfrom this analogy, gave the following relation \nbetween wavelength (λ) and momentum (p) of \na material particle.Unit 2.indd   499/9/2022   4:28:15 PM50SolutionAccording to de Brogile equation (2.22)\u001f\u001e\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001chmvJskgms(.)(.)()6626100110341= 6.626 × 10–34 m\t(J\t=\tkg\tm2 s–2) Problem 2.13The mass of an electron is 9.1×10–31 kg.

This fact has been put to use in making \nan electron microscope, which is based on \nthe wavelike behaviour of electrons just as an \nordinary microscope utilises the wave nature \nof light. An electron microscope is a powerful �tool\tin\tmodern\tscientific\tresearch\tbecause\tit\tachieves\ta\tmagnification\tof\tabout\t15\tmillion\ttimes.It needs to be noted that according to de Broglie, every object in motion has a wave \ncharacter. The wavelengths associated with \nordinary objects are so short (because of their \nlarge masses) that their wave properties cannot be detected. The wavelengths associated with \nelectrons and other subatomic particles (with \nvery small mass) can however be detected \nexperimentally. Results obtained from \nthe following problems prove these points \nqualitatively.Problem 2.12What will be the wavelength of a ball of mass 0.1 kg moving with a velocity of \n10 m s–1 ?2.5.2 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle Werner Heisenberg a German physicist in 1927, stated uncertainty principle which is the consequence of dual behaviour of matter \nand radiation. It states that it is impossible to determine simultaneously, the exact \nposition and exact momentum (or velocity) of an electron.Mathematically, it can be given as in equation (2.23).Louis de Broglie \n(1892 – 1987) Louis de Broglie, a French physicist, studied history \nas an undergraduate in the �early 1910’s. His interest turned to science as a result \nof his assignment to radio \ncommunications in World �War I. He received his Dr. Sc. from the University of Paris in 1924. �He was professor of theoretical physics at �the University of Paris from 1932 untill his �retirement in 1962. He was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929.Unit 2.indd   509/9/2022   4:28:16 PM51                         (2.23)where ∆x is the uncertainty in position and ∆px (or ∆vx) is the uncertainty in momentum (or velocity) of the particle. If the position of the electron is known with high degree of \naccuracy (∆x is small), then the velocity of the \nelectron will be uncertain [∆(vx) is large]. On the other hand, if the velocity of the electron \nis known precisely (∆(vx ) is small), then the position of the electron will be uncertain  (∆x will be large). Thus, if we carry out some \nphysical measurements on the electron’s \nposition or velocity, the outcome will always \ndepict a fuzzy or blur picture.The uncertainty principle can be best understood with the help of an example. Suppose you are asked to measure the \nthickness of a sheet of paper with an \nunmarked metrestick. Obviously, the results \nobtained would be extremely inaccurate \nand meaningless. In order to obtain any \naccuracy, you should use an instrument \ngraduated in units smaller than the thickness \nof a sheet of the paper. Analogously, in order \nto determine the position of an electron, we \nmust use a meterstick calibrated in units of \nsmaller than the dimensions of electron (keep \nin mind that an electron is considered as a \npoint charge and is therefore, dimensionless). \nTo observe an electron, we can illuminate it \nwith “light” or electromagnetic radiation. The \n“light” used must have a wavelength smaller \nthan the dimensions of an electron. The high momentum photons of such light ph=\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019  would change the energy of electrons by collisions. In this process we, no doubt, \nwould be able to calculate the position of the \nelectron, but we would know very little about \nthe velocity of the electron after the collision.Significance of Uncertainty PrincipleOne of the important implications of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is that it �rules out existence of definite paths or \ntrajectories of electrons and other similar \nparticles. The trajectory of an object is \ndetermined by its location and velocity at \nvarious moments. If we know where a body \nis at a particular instant and if we also know \nits velocity and the forces acting on it at that \ninstant, we can tell where the body would \nbe sometime later. We, therefore, conclude \nthat the position of an object and its velocity \nfix its trajectory. Since for a sub-atomic \nobject such as an electron, it is not possible \nsimultaneously to determine the position and \nvelocity at any given instant to an arbitrary \ndegree of precision, it is not possible to talk \nof the trajectory of an electron.The effect of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is significant only for motion of \nmicroscopic objects and is negligible for \nthat of macroscopic objects. This can be \nseen from the following examples.If uncertainty principle is applied to an object of mass, say about a milligram (10–6 kg), then Werner Heisenberg (1901 – 1976) Werner Heisenberg (1901 – 1976) received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Munich in 1923. He then spent a year working with Max Born at Gottingen and three years with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. He was professor of �physics at the University of Leipzig from 1927 to 1941. During World War II, Heisenberg \nwas in charge of German research on the atomic bomb. After the war he was named �director of Max Planck Institute for physics in Gottingen. He was also accomplished �mountain climber. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932.Unit 2.indd   519/9/2022   4:28:16 PM52The value of ∆v∆x obtained is extremely small\tand\tis\tinsignificant.\tTherefore,\tone\tmay say that in dealing with milligram-sized or heavier objects, the associated uncertainties are hardly of any real \nconsequence.In the case of a microscopic object like an electron on the other hand. ∆v.∆x obtained is much larger and such uncertainties are of real \nconsequence. For example, for an electron \nwhose mass is 9.11×10–31 kg., according to Heisenberg uncertainty principleIt, therefore, means that if one tries to find\tthe\texact\tlocation\tof\tthe\telectron,\tsay\tto an uncertainty of only 10–8 m, then the uncertainty ∆v in velocity would be 101010421841\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001emsmms which is so large that the classical picture of\telectrons\tmoving\tin\tBohr’s\torbits\t(fixed)\tcannot hold good. It, therefore, means that the precise statements of the position \nand momentum of electrons have to be \nreplaced by the statements of probability, \nthat the electron has at a given position and momentum. This is what happens in the quantum mechanical model of atom.= 0.579×107 m s–1\t(1J\t=\t1\tkg\tm2 s–2)= 5.79×106 m s–1Problem 2.16 A golf ball has a mass of 40g, and a speed of 45 m/s. If the speed can be measured \nwithin accuracy of 2%, calculate the \nuncertainty in the position.SolutionThe uncertainty in the speed is 2%, i.e., Using the equation (2.22)= 1.46×10–33 mThis is nearly ~ 1018 times smaller than the diameter of a typical atomic \nnucleus. As mentioned earlier for large \nparticles, the uncertainty principle sets \nno meaningful limit to the precision of \nmeasurements.Reasons for the Failure of the Bohr ModelOne can now understand the reasons for the failure of the Bohr model. In  Bohr model, \nan electron is regarded as a charged particle �moving\t\tin\twell\tdefined\tcircular\torbits\tabout\tthe nucleus. The wave character of the \nelectron is not considered in  Bohr model. �Further,\tan\torbit\tis\ta\tclearly\tdefined\tpath\tand this path can completely be defined only if both the position and the velocity of \nthe electron are known exactly at the same \ntime. This is not possible according to the \nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr model \nof the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only \nignores dual behaviour of matter but also �contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Problem 2.15A microscope using suitable photons is employed to locate an electron in an atom \nwithin a distance of 0.1 Å. What is the \nuncertainty involved in the measurement \nof its velocity?Solution∆ x ∆p =  or ∆ x m ∆ v  Unit 2.indd   529/9/2022   4:28:16 PM53In view of these inherent weaknesses in the Bohr model, there was no point in extending \nBohr model to other atoms. In fact an insight \ninto the structure of the atom was needed \nwhich could account for wave-particle duality \nof matter and be consistent with Heisenberg \nuncertainty principle. This came with the \nadvent of quantum mechanics.2.6  QUANTUM MECHANICAL MODEL OF ATOMClassical mechanics, based on Newton’s laws of motion, successfully describes the motion of all macroscopic objects such as a \nfalling stone, orbiting planets etc., which have \nessentially a particle-like behaviour as shown \nin the previous section. However it fails when \napplied to microscopic objects like electrons, \natoms, molecules etc. This is mainly because \nof the fact that classical mechanics ignores \nthe concept of dual behaviour of matter \nespecially for sub-atomic particles and the \nuncertainty principle. The branch of science \nthat takes into account  this dual behaviour \nof matter is called quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is a theoretical science that deals with the study of the \nmotions of the microscopic objects that have \nboth observable wave like and particle like �properties.\tIt\tspecifies\tthe\tlaws\tof\tmotion\tthat\tthese objects obey. When quantum mechanics is applied to macroscopic objects (for which wave\tlike\tproperties\tare\tinsignificant)\tthe\tresults are the same as those from the classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics was developed independently in 1926 by Werner Heisenberg \nand Erwin Schrödinger. Here, however, we \nshall be discussing the quantum mechanics \nwhich is based on the ideas of wave motion. \nThe fundamental equation of quantum \nmechanics was developed by Schrödinger  \nand it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in \n1933. This equation which incorporates wave-\nparticle duality of matter as proposed by de \nBroglie is quite complex and knowledge of \nhigher mathematics  is needed to solve it. You \nwill learn its solutions for different systems \nin higher classes. For a system (such as an atom or a molecule whose energy does not change with time) the Schrödinger equation is written as  where  is a mathematical operator called Hamiltonian. Schrödinger \ngave a recipe of constructing this operator \nfrom the expression for the total energy of \nthe system. The total energy of the system \ntakes into account the kinetic energies of all \nthe sub-atomic particles (electrons, nuclei), \nattractive potential between the electrons \nand nuclei and repulsive potential among the \nelectrons and nuclei individually. Solution of this equation gives E and ψ.Hydrogen Atom and the Schrödinger \nEquationWhen Schrödinger equation is solved for hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible \nenergy levels the electron can occupy and \nthe corresponding wave function(s) (ψ) of the electron associated with each energy \nlevel. These quantized energy states and \ncorresponding wave functions which are \ncharacterized by a set of three quantum \nnumbers (principal quantum number \nn, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number ml ) arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the \nSchrödinger equation. When an electron is in any energy state, the wave function Erwin Schrödinger, an Austrian physicist received \nhis Ph.D. in theoretical \nphysics from the University �of Vienna in 1910. In 1927 \nSchrödinger succeeded Max \nPlanck at the  University of \nBerlin at Planck’s request. \nIn 1933, Schrödinger left \nBerlin because of his �opposition to Hitler and \nNazi policies and returned \nto Austria in 1936. After the invasion of Austria \nby Germany, Schrödinger was forcibly removed �from his professorship. He then moved to Dublin, \nIreland where he remained for seventeen years. \nSchrödinger shared the Nobel Prize for Physics \nwith P.A.M. Dirac in 1933.Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961)Unit 2.indd   539/9/2022   4:28:17 PM54corresponding to that energy state contains all information about the electron. The wave \nfunction is a mathematical function whose \nvalue depends upon the coordinates of the \nelectron in the atom and does not carry any \nphysical meaning. Such wave functions of \nhydrogen or hydrogen like species with one \nelectron are called atomic orbitals. Such \nwave functions pertaining to one-electron \nspecies are called one-electron systems. The �probability\tof\tfinding\tan\telectron\tat\ta\tpoint\twithin an atom is proportional to the |ψ|2 at that point.  The quantum mechanical results \nof the hydrogen atom successfully predict \nall aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum \nincluding some phenomena that could not be \nexplained by the Bohr model.Application of  Schrödinger equation to multi-electron\tatoms\tpresents\ta\tdifficulty:\tthe\tSchrödinger equation cannot be solved exactly �for\ta\tmulti-electron\tatom.\tThis\tdifficulty\tcan\tbe overcome by using approximate methods. \nSuch calculations with the aid of modern computers show that orbitals in atoms other \nthan hydrogen do not differ in any radical \nway from the hydrogen orbitals discussed \nabove. The principal difference lies in the \nconsequence of increased nuclear charge. \nBecause of this  all the orbitals are somewhat \ncontracted. Further, as you shall see later (in \nsubsections 2.6.3 and 2.6.4), unlike orbitals \nof hydrogen or hydrogen like species, whose \nenergies depend only on the quantum number \nn, the energies of the orbitals in multi-electron atoms depend on quantum numbers n and l.Important Features of the Quantum Mechanical Model of AtomQuantum mechanical model of atom is the picture of the structure of the atom, which emerges from the application of the Schrödinger equation to atoms. The \nfollowing are the important features of the quantum-mechanical model of atom:1. The energy of electrons in atoms is quantized (i.e., can only have certain specific values), for example when \nelectrons are bound to the nucleus in \natoms.2. The existence of quantised electronic \nenergy levels is a direct result of the \nwave like properties of electrons and \nare allowed solutions of Schrödinger wave equation.3. Both the exact position and exact \nvelocity of an electron in an atom cannot be determined simultaneously \n(Heisenberg uncertainty principle). The \npath of an electron in an atom  therefore, \ncan never be determined or known \naccurately. That is why, as you shall see \nlater on, one talks of only probability of �finding\tthe\telectron\tat\tdifferent\tpoints\tin\t an atom.4. An atomic orbital is the wave function ψ for an electron in an atom. Whenever an electron is described \nby a wave function, we say that the \nelectron occupies that orbital. Since \nmany such wave functions are possible \nfor an electron, there are many atomic \norbitals in an atom. These “one electron \norbital wave functions” or orbitals form \nthe basis of the electronic structure \nof atoms. In each orbital, the electron �has\ta\tdefinite\tenergy.\tAn\torbital\tcannot\tcontain more than two electrons. In a multi-electron atom, the electrons are �filled\tin\tvarious\torbitals\tin\tthe\torder\tof\tincreasing energy. For each electron \nof a multi-electron atom, there shall, \ntherefore, be an orbital wave function characteristic of the orbital it occupies. \nAll the information about the electron \nin an atom is stored in its orbital wave \nfunction ψ and quantum mechanics makes it possible to extract this \ninformation out of ψ.5.\tThe\tprobability\tof\tfinding\tan\telectron\tat\ta point within an atom is proportional to the square of the orbital wave function \ni.e., |ψ|2 at that point. |ψ|2 is known as probability density and is always positive. From the value of |ψ|2 at different points within an atom, \nit is possible to predict the region \naround the nucleus where electron \nwill most probably be found.2.6.1 Orbitals and Quantum Numbers A large number of orbitals are possible in an atom. Qualitatively these orbitals can Unit 2.indd   549/9/2022   4:28:17 PM55be distinguished by their size, shape and orientation. An orbital of smaller size means �there\tis\tmore\tchance\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tnear the nucleus. Similarly shape and orientation mean that there is more probability �of\tfinding\tthe\telectron\talong\tcertain\tdirections\tthan along others. Atomic orbitals are precisely \ndistinguished by what are known as quantum \nnumbers. Each orbital is designated by three quantum numbers labelled as n, l and ml. The principal quantum number ‘n’ is a positive integer with value of n = 1,2,3....... \nThe principal quantum number determines the size and to large extent the energy of the orbital. For hydrogen atom and hydrogen like species (He+, Li2+, .... etc.) energy and size of the orbital depends only on ‘n’.The principal quantum number also identifies\tthe\tshell. With the increase in the value of ‘n’, the number of allowed orbital increases and are given by ‘n2’ All the orbitals of a given value of ‘n’ constitute a single shell of atom and are represented \nby the following letters      n =  1   2   3   4   ............ Shell =   K  L  M  N ............ Size of an orbital increases with increase of principal quantum number ‘n’. In other words the electron will be located away from the nucleus. Since energy is required in shifting \naway the negatively charged electron from the \npositively charged nucleus, the energy of the \norbital will increase with increase of n. Azimuthal quantum number. ‘l’ is also known as orbital angular momentum or subsidiary quantum number.\tIt\tdefines\tthe\tthree-dimensional shape of the orbital. For a \ngiven value of n, l  can have n values ranging from 0 to n – 1, that is, for a given value of n, the possible value of l are : l = 0, 1, 2, .......... (n–1)For example, when n = 1, value of l is only 0. For n = 2, the possible value of l can be 0 \nand 1. For n = 3, the possible l values are 0, 1 and 2.Each shell consists of one or more  sub-shells or sub-levels. The number of  sub-shells in a principal shell is equal to the value of n.\tFor\texample\tin\tthe\tfirst\tshell\t(n = 1), there is only one sub-shell which corresponds \nto l = 0. There are two sub-shells (l = 0, 1) in the second shell (n = 2), three (l = 0, 1, 2) in \nthird shell (n = 3) and so on. Each sub-shell is assigned an azimuthal quantum number (l). Sub-shells corresponding to different values \nof l are represented by the following symbols.Value for l : 0   1 2   3 4   5 ............notation for  s   p d   f g   h ............sub-shell Table 2.4 shows the permissible values of ‘l ’ for a given principal quantum number and the corresponding sub-shell notation.Magnetic orbital quantum number. ‘ml’ gives information about the spatial orientation of the orbital with respect to \nstandard set of co-ordinate axis. For any �sub-shell (defined by ‘l’ value) 2l+1 values of ml are possible and these values are given by :ml  = – l, – (l–1), – (l–2)... 0,1... (l–2), (l–1), l Thus for l = 0, the only permitted value of ml = 0, [2(0)+1 = 1, one s orbital]. For l = 1, ml can be –1, 0 and +1 [2(1)+1 = 3, three p orbitals]. For l = 2, ml = –2, –1, 0, +1 and +2, [2(2)+1\t=\t5,\tfive\td orbitals]. It should be noted that the values of ml are derived from l and that the value of l are derived from n.Table 2.4  Subshell NotationsnlSubshell notation12\n2\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\n4\n40\n0\n1\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n31s�2s2p3s3p3d4s4p4d4fUnit 2.indd   559/9/2022   4:28:17 PM56Each orbital in an atom, therefore, is defined\tby\ta\tset\tof\tvalues\tfor\tn, l and ml. An orbital described by the quantum numbers  n = 2, l = 1, ml = 0 is an orbital in the p sub-shell of the second shell. The following chart gives the relation between the subshell and \nthe number of orbitals associated with it.Value of l012345Subshell notationspdfghnumber of orbitals1357911Electron spin ‘s’ : The three quantum numbers labelling an atomic orbital can be �used\tequally\twell\tto\tdefine\tits\tenergy,\tshape\tand orientation. But all these quantum \nnumbers are not enough to explain the line \nspectra observed in the case of multi-electron atoms, that is, some of the lines actually occur \nin doublets (two lines closely spaced), triplets \n(three lines, closely spaced) etc. This suggests \nthe presence of a few more energy levels than \npredicted by the three quantum numbers.In 1925, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit proposed the presence of the fourth quantum number known as the electron \nspin quantum number (ms). An electron spins around its own axis, much in a similar \nway as earth spins around its own axis while \nrevolving around the sun. In other words, \nan electron has, besides charge and mass, \nintrinsic spin angular quantum number. Spin angular momentum of the electron — a vector quantity, can have two orientations relative to \nthe chosen axis. These two orientations are \ndistinguished by the spin quantum numbers \nms which can take the values of +½ or –½. These are called the two spin states of the \nelectron and are normally represented by two arrows, ↑ (spin up) and ↓ (spin down). Two electrons that have different ms values (one +½ and the other –½) are said to have opposite spins. An orbital cannot hold more than two \nelectrons and these two electrons should have \nopposite spins.To sum up, the four quantum numbers provide the following information :i) n\tdefines\tthe\tshell,\t\tdetermines\tthe\tsize\tof the orbital and also to a large extent \nthe energy of the orbital.ii) There are n subshells in the nth shell. l identifies\tthe\tsubshell\tand\tdetermines\tthe shape of the orbital (see section 2.6.2). There are (2l+1) orbitals of each \ntype in a subshell, that is, one s orbital \n(l = 0), three p orbitals (l\t=\t1)\tand\tfive\td orbitals (l = 2) per subshell. To some extent l also determines the energy of the orbital in a multi-electron atom.iii) ml designates the orientation of the orbital. For a given value of l, ml has (2l+1) values, the same as the number \nof orbitals per subshell. It means that Orbit, orbital and its importanceOrbit and orbital are not synonymous. An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path around the nucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the electron is impossible \naccording to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore, have no real meaning and \ntheir existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An atomic orbital, on the other hand, \nis a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one electron wave function ψ in an atom. It is characterized by three quantum numbers (n, l and ml) and its value depends upon the coordinates of the electron. ψ has, by itself, no physical meaning. It is the square of the wave function i.e., |ψ|2 which has a physical meaning. |ψ|2 at any point in an atom gives the value of probability density at that point. Probability density (|ψ|2) is the probability per unit volume and the product of |ψ|2 and\ta\tsmall\tvolume\t(called\ta\tvolume\telement)\tyields\tthe\tprobability\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tin\tthat\tvolume (the reason for specifying a small volume element is that |ψ|2 varies from one region to another in space but its value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element). �The\ttotal\tprobability\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tin\ta\tgiven\tvolume\tcan\tthen\tbe\tcalculated\tby\tthe\tsum\tof all the products of |ψ|2 and the corresponding volume elements. It is thus possible to get the probable distribution of an electron in an orbital.Unit 2.indd   569/9/2022   4:28:17 PM57the number of orbitals is equal to the number of ways in which they are \noriented. iv) ms refers to orientation of the spin of the electron.According to the German physicist, Max Born, the square of the wave function  (i.e.,ψ 2) at a point gives the probability density of the electron at that point. The variation \nof ψ 2 as a function of r for 1s and 2s orbitals is given in Fig. 2.12(b). Here again, you may \nnote that the curves for 1s and 2s orbitals \nare different.It may be noted that for 1s orbital the probability density is maximum at the \nnucleus and it decreases sharply as we move \naway from it. On the other hand, for 2s �orbital\tthe\tprobability\tdensity\tfirst\tdecreases\tsharply to zero and again starts increasing. \nAfter reaching a small maxima it decreases again and approaches zero as the value of \nr increases further. The region where this probability density function reduces to zero is called nodal surfaces or simply nodes. In general, it has been found that ns-orbital \nhas (n – 1) nodes, that is, number of nodes \nincreases with increase of principal quantum \nnumber n. In other words, number of nodes for 2s orbital is one, two for 3s and so on.These probability density variation can be visualised in terms of charge cloud diagrams \n[Fig. 2.13(a)]. In these diagrams, the density Fig. 2.12 The plots of (a) the orbital wave  function ψ(r); (b) the variation of probability density ψ2(r) as a function of distance r of the electron from the �nucleus for 1s and 2s orbitals. Problem 2.17 What is the total number of orbitals associated with the principal quantum \nnumber n = 3 ?SolutionFor n = 3, the possible values of l are 0, 1 and 2. Thus there is one 3s orbital  (n = 3, l = 0 and ml = 0); there are three 3p orbitals (n = 3, l = 1 and ml = –1, 0, +1);\tthere\tare\tfive\t3d orbitals (n = 3, l = 2 and ml = –2, –1, 0, +1+, +2).Therefore, the total number of orbitals \nis 1+3+5 = 9The same value can also be obtained by using the relation; number of orbitals  = n2, i.e.  32 = 9.Problem 2.18 Using s, p, d, f notations, describe the orbital with the following quantum numbers (a) n = 2, l = 1, (b) n = 4, l = 0, (c) n = 5,  l = 3, (d) n = 3, l = 2Solution  n   l orbital    a)  2  1   2p    b)  4  0   4s    c)  5  3   5f    d)  3  2   3d2.6.2 Shapes of Atomic OrbitalsThe orbital wave function or ψ for an electron in an atom has no physical meaning. It is simply a mathematical function of the \ncoordinates of the electron. However, for \ndifferent orbitals the plots of corresponding \nwave functions as a function of r (the distance from the nucleus) are different. Fig. 2.12(a), \ngives such plots for 1s (n = 1, l = 0) and 2s  (n = 2, l = 0) orbitals. Unit 2.indd   579/9/2022   4:28:17 PM58of the dots in a region represents electron probability density in that region.Boundary surface diagrams of constant probability density for different orbitals give a fairly good representation of the shapes \nof the orbitals. In this representation, a \nboundary surface or contour surface is \ndrawn in space for an orbital on which the \nvalue of probability density |ψ|2 is constant. In principle many such boundary surfaces \nmay be possible. However, for a given \norbital, only that boundary surface diagram \nof constant probability density* is taken to \nbe good representation of the shape of the \norbital which encloses a region or volume in �which\tthe\tprobability\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tis very high, say, 90%. The boundary surface diagram for 1s and 2s orbitals are given in  Fig. 2.13(b). One may ask a question : Why \ndo we not draw a boundary surface diagram, \nwhich bounds a region in which the probability �of\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tis,\t100\t%?\tThe\tanswer\tto this question is that the probability density \n|ψ|2 has always some value, howsoever small\tit\tmay\tbe,\tat\tany\tfinite\tdistance\tfrom\tthe nucleus. It is therefore, not possible to draw a boundary surface diagram of a rigid �size\tin\twhich\tthe\tprobability\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron is 100%. Boundary surface diagram \nfor a s orbital is actually a sphere centred on the nucleus. In two dimensions, this sphere \nlooks like a circle. It encloses a region in �which\tprobability\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tis\tabout 90%.Thus, we see that 1s and 2s orbitals are spherical in shape. In reality all the s-orbitals \nare spherically symmetric, that is, the �probability\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tat\ta\tgiven\tdistance is equal in all the directions. It is also \nobserved that the size of the s orbital increases \nwith increase in n, that is, 4s \u003e 3s \u003e 2s \u003e 1s and the electron is located further away from \nthe nucleus as the principal quantum number \nincreases.Boundary surface diagrams for three 2p orbitals (l = 1) are shown in Fig. 2.14. In these diagrams, the nucleus is at the origin. \nHere, unlike s-orbitals, the boundary surface \ndiagrams are not spherical. Instead each  p orbital consists of two sections called lobes \nthat are on either side of the plane that passes \nthrough the nucleus. The probability density * If probability density |ψ|2 is constant on a given surface, |ψ| is also constant over the surface. The boundary surface for |ψ|2 and |ψ| are identical.Fig. 2.14 Boundary surface diagrams of the �three 2p orbitals.Fig. 2.13 (a) Probability density plots of 1s and 2s atomic orbitals. The density of the \ndots represents the probability density �of finding the electron in that region.  (b) Boundary surface diagram for 1s �and 2s orbitals.Unit 2.indd   589/9/2022   4:28:19 PM59function is zero on the plane where the two lobes touch each other. The size, shape and \nenergy of the three orbitals are identical. \nThey differ however, in the way the lobes are \noriented. Since the lobes may be considered to \nlie along the x, y or z axis, they are given the \ndesignations 2px, 2py, and 2pz. It should be understood, however, that there is no simple \nrelation between the values of ml (–1, 0 and +1) and the x, y and z directions. For our purpose, it\tis\tsufficient\tto\tremember\tthat,\tbecause\tthere are three possible values of ml, there are, therefore, three p orbitals whose axes are mutually perpendicular. Like s orbitals, \np orbitals increase in size and energy with \nincrease in the principal quantum number \nand hence the order of the energy and size of \nvarious p orbitals is 4p \u003e 3p \u003e 2p. Further, like s orbitals, the probability density functions for \np-orbital also pass through value zero, besides at\tzero\tand\tinfinite\tdistance,\tas\tthe\tdistance\tfrom the nucleus increases. The number of \nnodes are given by the n –2, that is number of radial node is 1 for 3p orbital, two for 4p orbital and so on.For l = 2, the orbital is known as d-orbital and the minimum value of principal quantum \nnumber (n) has to be 3. as the value of l cannot be greater than n–1.\tThere\tare\tfive\tml values (–2, –1, 0, +1 and +2) for l = 2 and thus there �are\tfive\td orbitals. The boundary surface diagram of d orbitals are shown in Fig. 2.15.The\tfive\td-orbitals are designated as dxy, dyz, dxz, dx2–y2 and dz2.\tThe\tshapes\tof\tthe\tfirst\tfour d-orbitals are similar to each other, where as\tthat\tof\tthe\tfifth\tone,\tdz2, is different from others,\tbut\tall\tfive\t3d orbitals are equivalent in energy. The d orbitals for which n is greater than 3 (4d, 5d...) also have shapes similar to 3d orbital, but differ in energy and size.Besides the radial nodes (i.e., probability density function is zero), the probability \ndensity functions for the np and nd orbitals \nare zero at the plane (s), passing through the \nnucleus (origin). For example, in case of pz orbital, xy-plane is a nodal plane, in case of \ndxy orbital, there are two nodal planes passing through the origin and bisecting the xy plane \ncontaining z-axis. These are called angular \nnodes and number of angular nodes are given \nby ‘l’, i.e., one angular node for p orbitals, two angular nodes for ‘d’ orbitals and so on. The total number of nodes are given by (n–1), i.e., sum of l angular nodes and (n – l – 1) radial nodes.2.6.3 Energies of OrbitalsThe energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom is determined solely by the principal quantum Fig. 2.15 Boundary surface diagrams of the five 3d orbitals.Unit 2.indd   599/9/2022   4:28:20 PM60number. Thus the energy of the orbitals in hydrogen atom  increases as follows :1s \u003c 2s = 2p \u003c 3s = 3p = 3d \u003c4s = 4p = 4d = 4f \u003c                                               (2.23) and is depicted in Fig. 2.16. Although the shapes of 2s and 2p orbitals are different, an electron has the same energy when it is \nin the 2s orbital as when it is present in 2p \norbital. The orbitals having the same energy \nare called degenerate. The 1s orbital in a hydrogen atom, as said earlier, corresponds \nto the most stable condition and is called the \nground state and an electron residing in this \norbital is most strongly held by the nucleus. \nAn electron in the 2s, 2p or higher orbitals in \na hydrogen atom is in excited state.The energy of an electron in a multi- electron atom, unlike that of the hydrogen atom, depends not only on its principal \nquantum number (shell), but also on its \nazimuthal quantum number (subshell). That \nis, for a given principal quantum number, s,  p, d, f ... all have different energies. Within a given principal quantum number, the \nenergy of orbitals increases in the order \ns\u003cp\u003cd\u003cf. For higher energy levels, these differences\tare\tsufficiently\tpronounced\tand\tstraggering of orbital energy may result, e.g., 4s\u003c3d and 6s\u003c5d; 4f\u003c6p. The main reason for having different energies of the \nsubshells is the mutual repulsion among the \nelectrons in multi-electron atoms. The only \nelectrical interaction present in hydrogen \natom is the attraction between the negatively \ncharged electron and the positively charged nucleus. In multi-electron atoms, besides the \npresence of attraction between the electron \nand nucleus, there are repulsion terms \nbetween every electron and other electrons \npresent in the atom. Thus the stability of an \nelectron in a multi-electron atom is because \ntotal attractive interactions are more than \nthe repulsive interactions. In general, the \nrepulsive interaction of the electrons in the \nouter shell with the electrons in the inner shell \nare more important. On the other hand, the \nattractive interactions of an electron increases \nwith increase of positive charge (Ze) on the �nucleus.\tDue\tto\tthe\tpresence\tof\telectrons\tin\tthe inner shells, the electron in the outer shell \nwill not experience the full positive charge of \nthe nucleus (Ze). The effect will be lowered due to the partial screening of positive charge \non the nucleus by the inner shell electrons. \nThis is known as the shielding of the outer shell electrons from the nucleus  by the \ninner shell electrons, and the net positive \ncharge experienced by the outer electrons is \nknown as effective nuclear charge (Zeff e). Despite\tthe\tshielding\tof\tthe\touter\telectrons\tfrom the nucleus by the inner shell electrons, \nthe attractive force experienced by the outer \nshell electrons increases with increase of \nnuclear charge. In other words, the energy of \ninteraction between, the nucleus and electron Fig. 2.16 Energy level diagrams for the few electronic shells of (a) hydrogen atom and (b) multi-electronic atoms. Note that \norbitals for the same value of principal \nquantum number, have the same \nenergies even for different azimuthal \nquantum number for hydrogen atom. \nIn case of multi-electron atoms, orbitals \nwith same principal quantum number \npossess different energies for different \nazimuthal quantum numbers.Unit 2.indd   609/9/2022   4:28:20 PM61(that is orbital energy) decreases (that is  more negative) with the increase of atomic number (Z).Both the attractive and repulsive interactions depend upon the shell and shape of the orbital in which the electron is present. \nFor example electrons present in spherical \nshaped, s orbital shields the outer electrons from the nucleus more effectively as compared \nto electrons present in p orbital. Similarly electrons present in p orbitals shield the outer electrons from the nucleus more than the \nelectrons present in d orbitals, even though all  these orbitals are present in the same shell. \nFurther within a shell, due to spherical shape \nof s orbital, the s orbital electron spends more time close to the nucleus in comparison to p \norbital electron which spends more time in \nthe vicinity of nucleus in comparison to d \norbital electron. In other words, for a given shell (principal quantum number), the Zeff experienced by the electron decreases with increase of azimuthal quantum number (l), \nthat is, the s orbital electron will be more \ntightly bound to the nucleus than p orbital \nelectron which in turn will be better tightly \nbound than the d orbital electron. The energy \nof electrons in s orbital will be lower (more \nnegative) than that of p orbital electron which will have less energy than that of d \norbital electron and so on. Since the extent \nof shielding from the nucleus is different for \nelectrons in different orbitals, it leads to the \nsplitting of energy levels within the same \nshell (or same principal quantum number), \nthat is, energy of electron in an orbital, as \nmentioned earlier, depends upon the values \nof n and l. Mathematically, the dependence of energies of the orbitals on n and l are quite \ncomplicated but one simple rule is that, the \nlower the value of (n + l) for an orbital, the \nlower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same value of (n + l), the orbital with lower value of n will have the lower energy. The Table 2.5 illustrates the (n + l ) rule and Fig. 2.16 depicts the energy levels of multi-\nelectrons atoms. It may be noted that different \nsubshells of a particular shell have different \nenergies in case of multi-electrons atoms. \nHowever, in hydrogen atom, these have the same energy. Lastly it may be mentioned here \nthat energies of the orbitals in the same subshell decrease with increase in the \natomic number (Zeff). For example, energy of 2s orbital of hydrogen atom is greater than \nthat of 2s orbital of lithium and that of lithium is greater than that of sodium and so on, that is, E2s(H) \u003e E2s(Li) \u003e E2s(Na) \u003e E2s(K).2.6.4 Filling of Orbitals in AtomThe\tfilling\tof\telectrons\tinto\tthe\torbitals\tof\tdifferent atoms takes place according to \nthe aufbau principle which is based on the Pauli’s exclusion principle, the Hund’s rule \nof maximum multiplicity and the relative \nenergies of the orbitals.Aufbau PrincipleThe word ‘aufbau’ in German means ‘building up’. The building up of orbitals means the Table 2.5 Arrangement of Orbitals with Increasing Energy on the Basis of (n+l) RuleUnit 2.indd   619/9/2022   4:28:20 PM62filling up of orbitals with electrons. The principle states : In the ground state of the atoms, the orbitals are filled in order of their increasing energies. In other words, �electrons\tfirst\toccupy\tthe\tlowest\tenergy\torbital\tavailable to them and enter into higher energy \norbitals only after the lower energy orbitals are\tfilled.\tAs\tyou\thave\tlearnt\tabove,\tenergy\tof a given orbital depends upon effective nuclear charge and different type of orbitals \nare affected to different extent. Thus, there \nis no single ordering of energies of orbitals \nwhich will be universally correct for all atoms.However, following order of  energies of the orbitals is extremely useful:1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 4f, \n5d, 6p, 7s...The order may be remembered by using the method given in Fig. 2.17. Starting from the top, the direction of the arrows gives the order\tof\tfilling\tof\torbitals,\tthat\tis\tstarting\tfrom right top to bottom left. With respect to \nplacement of outermost valence electrons, \nit is remarkably accurate for all atoms. For example, valence electron in potassium must choose between 3d and 4s orbitals and as predicted by this sequence, it is found \nin 4s orbital. The above order should be assumed\tto\tbe\ta\trough\tguide\tto\tthe\tfilling\tof energy levels. In many cases, the orbitals \nare similar in energy and small changes in atomic structure may bring about a change �in\tthe\torder\tof\tfilling.\tEven\tthen,\tthe\tabove\tseries is a useful guide to the building of the \nelectronic structure of an atom provided that \nit is remembered that exceptions may occur.Pauli Exclusion PrincipleThe\tnumber\tof\telectrons\tto\tbe\tfilled\tin\tvarious\torbitals is restricted by the exclusion principle, given by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli (1926). According to this principle : No two electrons in an atom can have the same set \nof four quantum numbers. Pauli exclusion principle can also be stated as : “Only two electrons may exist in the same orbital and \nthese electrons must have opposite spin.” \nThis means that the two electrons can have the same value of three quantum numbers \nn, l and ml, but must have the opposite spin quantum number. The restriction imposed \nby Pauli’s exclusion principle on the number \nof electrons in an orbital helps in calculating \nthe capacity of electrons to be present in any \nsubshell. For example, subshell 1s comprises one orbital and thus the maximum number of \nelectrons present in 1s subshell can be two, in p and d subshells, the maximum number of \nelectrons can be 6 and 10 and so on. This can \nbe summed up as : the maximum number \nof electrons in the shell with principal \nquantum number n is equal to 2n2.Hund’s Rule of Maximum MultiplicityThis\trule\tdeals\twith\tthe\tfilling\tof\telectrons\tinto\tthe orbitals belonging to the same subshell (that is, orbitals of equal energy, called \ndegenerate orbitals). It states : pairing of Fig.2.17 Order of filling of orbitalsUnit 2.indd   629/9/2022   4:28:20 PM63electrons in the orbitals belonging to the same subshell (p, d or f) does not take place until each orbital belonging to that \nsubshell has got one electron each i.e., it \nis singly occupied.Since there are three p,\tfive\td and seven f orbitals, therefore, the pairing of electrons will \nstart in the p, d and f orbitals with the entry of 4th, 6th and 8th electron, respectively. It �has\tbeen\tobserved\tthat\thalf\tfilled\tand\tfully\tfilled\tdegenerate\tset\tof\torbitals\tacquire\textra\tstability due to their symmetry (see Section, \n2.6.7).2.6.5 Electronic Configuration of AtomsThe distribution of electrons into orbitals of an atom is called its electronic configuration. If one keeps in mind the basic rules which �govern\tthe\tfilling\tof\tdifferent\tatomic\torbitals,\tthe electronic configurations of different \natoms can be written very easily.The\telectronic\tconfiguration\tof\tdifferent\tatoms can be represented in two ways. For  example :(i)   sa pbdc ...... notation(ii)  Orbital diagram\n \n s                    p                       dIn the first notation, the subshell is represented by the respective letter symbol and the number of electrons present in the \nsubshell is depicted, as the super script, like a, b, c, ... etc. The similar subshell represented for different shells is differentiated by writing \nthe principal quantum number before the \nrespective subshell. In the second notation  \neach orbital of the subshell is represented \nby a box and the electron is represented by \nan arrow (↑) a positive spin or an arrow (↓)  \na negative spin. The advantage of second �notation\tover\tthe\tfirst\tis\tthat\tit\trepresents\tall\tthe four quantum numbers.The hydrogen atom has only one electron which goes in the orbital with the lowest energy, namely 1s.\tThe\telectronic\tconfiguration\tof\tthe\thydrogen atom is 1s1 meaning that it has one electron in the 1s orbital. The second electron in helium (He) can also occupy the 1s\torbital.\tIts\tconfiguration\tis,\ttherefore,\t1s2. As mentioned above, the two electrons differ \nfrom each other with opposite spin, as can be seen from the orbital diagram.The third electron of lithium (Li) is not allowed in the 1s orbital because of Pauli exclusion principle. It, therefore, takes the \nnext available choice, namely the 2s orbital. �The\telectronic\tconfiguration\tof\tLi\tis\t1s22s1. The 2s orbital can accommodate one more �electron.\tThe\tconfiguration\tof\tberyllium\t(Be)\tatom is, therefore, 1s2 2s2 (see Table 2.6, page\t66\tfor\tthe\telectronic\tconfigurations\tof\telements).In the next six elements—boron  (B, 1s22s22p1), carbon (C, 1s22s22p2), nitrogen (N, 1s22s22p3), oxygen (O, 1s22s22p4),\tfluorine\t(F, 1s22s22p5) and neon (Ne, 1s22s22p6), the 2p orbitals\tget\tprogressively\tfilled.\tThis\tprocess\tis completed with the neon atom. The orbital picture of these elements can be represented as follows :The electronic configuration of the elements sodium (Na,1s22s22p63s1) to argon  (Ar,1s22s22p63s23p6), follow exactly the same pattern as the elements from lithium to neon \nwith the difference that the 3s and 3p orbitals are\tgetting\tfilled\tnow.\tThis\tprocess\tcan\tbe\tsimplified\tif\twe\trepresent\tthe\ttotal\tnumber\tof\t\telectrons\tin\tthe\tfirst\ttwo\tshells\tby\tthe\tname of element neon (Ne). The electronic configuration\tof the elements from sodium to Unit 2.indd   639/9/2022   4:28:21 PM64argon can be written as (Na, [Ne]3s1) to (Ar, [Ne] 3s23p6). The electrons in the completely filled\tshells\tare\tknown\tas\tcore\telectrons\tand\tthe electrons that are added to the electronic shell with the highest principal quantum \nnumber are called valence electrons. For example, the electrons in Ne are the core \nelectrons and the electrons from Na to Ar are \nthe valence electrons. In potassium (K) and \ncalcium (Ca), the 4s orbital, being lower in \nenergy than the 3d orbitals, is occupied by \none and two electrons respectively.A new pattern is followed beginning with scandium (Sc). The 3d orbital, being lower in energy than the 4p\torbital,\tis\tfilled\tfirst.\tConsequently, in the next ten elements, scandium (Sc), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), \nchromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu) and zinc �(Zn),\tthe\tfive\t3d orbitals are progressively occupied. We may be puzzled by the fact that\tchromium\tand\tcopper\thave\tfive\tand\tten\telectrons in 3d orbitals rather than four and nine as their position would have indicated \nwith two-electrons in the 4s orbital. The �reason\tis\tthat\tfully\tfilled\torbitals\tand\thalf-filled\torbitals\thave\textra\tstability\t(that\tis,\tlower energy). Thus p3, p6, d5, d10,f 7, f14 etc. configurations,\twhich\tare\teither\thalf-filled\tor\tfully\tfilled,\tare\tmore\tstable.\tChromium\tand copper therefore adopt the d5 and d10 configuration (Section 2.6.7)[caution: exceptions do exist] With the saturation of the 3d orbitals, the\tfilling\tof\tthe\t4p orbital starts at gallium (Ga) and is complete at krypton (Kr). In the next eighteen elements from rubidium (Rb) to\txenon\t(Xe),\tthe\tpattern\tof\tfilling\tthe\t5s, 4d and 5p orbitals are similar to that of 4s, 3d and 4p orbitals as discussed above. Then \ncomes the turn of the 6s orbital. In caesium \n(Cs) and the barium (Ba), this orbital contains \none and two electrons, respectively. Then from �lanthanum\t(La)\tto\tmercury\t(Hg),\tthe\tfilling\tup\tof electrons takes place in 4f and 5d orbitals. After\tthis,\tfilling\tof\t6p, then 7s\tand\tfinally\t5f and 6d orbitals takes place. The elements after uranium (U) are all short-lived and all of them\tare\tproduced\tartificially.\tThe\telectronic\tconfigurations\tof\tthe\tknown\telements\t(as\tdetermined by spectroscopic methods) are tabulated in Table 2.6 (page 66).One may ask what is the utility of knowing the electron configuration? The modern \napproach to the chemistry, infact, depends \nalmost entirely on electronic distribution to \nunderstand and explain chemical behaviour. \nFor example, questions like why two or more \natoms combine to form molecules, why some \nelements are metals while others are non-\nmetals, why elements like helium and argon \nare not reactive but elements like the halogens �are\treactive,\tfind\tsimple\texplanation\tfrom\tthe\telectronic\tconfiguration.\tThese\tquestions\thave\tno\tanswer\tin\tthe\tDaltonian\tmodel\tof\tatom.\tA detailed understanding of the electronic \nstructure of atom is, therefore, very essential for getting an insight into the various aspects \nof modern chemical knowledge.2.6.6 Stability of Completely Filled and   Half Filled SubshellsThe\tground\tstate\telectronic\tconfiguration\tof\tthe atom of an element always corresponds to the state of the lowest total electronic energy. The\telectronic\tconfigurations\tof\tmost\tof\tthe\tatoms follow the basic rules given in Section 2.6.5. However, in certain elements such as \nCu, or Cr, where the two subshells (4s and \n3d) differ slightly in their energies, an electron shifts from a subshell of lower energy (4s) to a subshell of higher energy (3d), provided such \na shift results in all orbitals of the subshell \nof higher energy getting either completely �filled\tor\thalf\tfilled.\tThe\tvalence\telectronic\tconfigurations\tof\tCr\tand\tCu,\ttherefore,\tare\t3d5 4s1 and 3d10 4s1 respectively and not 3d4 4s2 and 3d9 4s2. It has been found that there is extra stability associated with these electronic �configurations.Unit 2.indd   649/9/2022   4:28:21 PM65The completely filled and completely  half-filled\tsubshells\tare\tstable\tdue\tto\tthe\tfollowing reasons:1.Symmetrical distribution of \nelectrons: It is well known that symmetry leads\tto\tstability.\tThe\tcompletely\tfilled\tor\thalf\tfilled\tsubshells\thave\tsymmetrical\tdistribution of electrons in them and \nare therefore more stable. Electrons in \nthe same subshell (here 3d) have equal \nenergy but different spatial distribution. Consequently, their shielding of one-\nanother is relatively small and the \nelectrons are more strongly attracted by \nthe nucleus.\n2. Exchange Energy : The stabilizing \neffect arises whenever two or more \nelectrons with the same spin are present \nin the degenerate orbitals of a subshell. \nThese electrons tend to exchange their \npositions and the energy released due to \nthis exchange is called exchange energy. \nThe number of exchanges that can take \nplace is maximum when the subshell �is\teither\thalf\tfilled\tor\tcompletely\tfilled\t (Fig. 2.18). As a result the exchange energy is maximum and so is the stability. You may note that the exchange energy is at the basis of Hund’s rule \nthat electrons which enter orbitals of \nequal energy have parallel spins as far \nas possible. In other words, the extra �stability\tof\thalf-filled\tand\tcompletely\tfilled\tsubshell is  due to: (i) relatively small shielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion \nenergy, and (iii) larger exchange energy. �Details\tabout\tthe\texchange\tenergy\twill\tbe\tdealt with in higher classes.Fig. 2.18 Possible exchange for a d5 configurationCauses of Stability of Completely Filled and Half-filled SubshellsUnit 2.indd   659/9/2022   4:28:21 PM66Table 2.6  Electronic Configurations of the Elements* Elements with exceptional electronic configurationsUnit 2.indd   669/9/2022   4:28:22 PM67** Elements with atomic number 112 and above have been reported but not yet fully authenticated and named.Unit 2.indd   679/9/2022   4:28:23 PM68SUMMARYAtoms are the building blocks of elements. They are the smallest parts of an element that chemically\treact.\tThe\tfirst\tatomic\ttheory,\tproposed\tby\tJohn\tDalton\tin\t1808,\tregarded\tatom\tas\tthe ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was proved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles: \nelectrons, protons and neutrons. The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal of various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.Thomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity with electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to \nbe evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle \nscattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively \ncharged nucleus, at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits. Rutherford model, which resembles the solar system, was no doubt an improvement over Thomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e., why the electron does not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of \natoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The �difficulties\tof\tthe\tRutherford\tmodel\twere\tovercome\tby\tNiels\tBohr\tin\t1913\tin\this\tmodel\tof\tthe\thydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in circular orbits. Only\tcertain\torbits\tcan\texist\tand\teach\torbit\tcorresponds\tto\ta\tspecific\tenergy.\tBohr\tcalculated\tthe energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the \nelectron and nucleus. Bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the spectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron atoms. The reason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged �particle\tmoving\tin\ta\twell\tdefined\tcircular\torbit\tabout\tthe\tnucleus.\tThe\twave\tcharacter\tof\tthe\telectron\tis\tignored\tin\tBohr’s\ttheory.\tAn\torbit\tis\ta\tclearly\tdefined\tpath\tand\tthis\tpath\tcan\tcompletely\tbe\tdefined\tonly\tif\tboth\tthe\texact\tposition\tand\tthe\texact\tvelocity\tof\tthe\telectron\tat the same time are known. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour \nof electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Erwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to describe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This \nequation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with Heisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a \nhydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and \nthe corresponding wave function(s) (ψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the electron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding \nwave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal quantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number ml) arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions \non the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The \nquantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the \nhydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the \nBohr model.According to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an atom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought to consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or \nmore orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems \n(such as He+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of the orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value of (n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (n + l ) value, the orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are Unit 2.indd   689/9/2022   4:28:23 PM69possible\tand\telectrons\tare\tfilled\tin\tthose\torbitals\tin\torder\tof\tincreasing\tenergy\tin\taccordance\twith Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers) and Hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity (pairing of electrons in the orbitals belonging to the same subshell does not take place until each orbital belonging to that subshell has got one electron each, i.e., is singly occupied). This forms the basis of the \nelectronic structure of atoms.EXERCISES2.1 (i) Calculate the number of electrons which will together weigh one gram.

    "input": "UNIT 6EQUILIBRIUMChemical equilibria are important in numerous biological and environmental processes. For example, equilibria \ninvolving O2 molecules and the protein hemoglobin play a crucial role in the transport and delivery of O2 from our lungs to our muscles. Similar equilibria involving CO \nmolecules and hemoglobin account for the toxicity of CO.When a liquid evaporates in a closed container, molecules with relatively higher kinetic energy escape \nthe liquid surface into the vapour phase and number of \nliquid molecules from the vapour phase strike the liquid \nsurface and are retained in the liquid phase. It gives rise \nto a constant vapour pressure because of an equilibrium in which the number of molecules leaving the liquid equals the \nnumber returning to liquid from the vapour. We say that \nthe system has reached equilibrium state at this stage. \nHowever, this is not static equilibrium and there is a lot of \nactivity at the boundary between the liquid and the vapour. \nThus, at equilibrium, the rate of evaporation is equal to the rate of condensation. It may be represented byH2O (l)   H2O (vap)The double half arrows indicate that the processes in both the directions are going on simultaneously. The \nmixture of reactants and products in the equilibrium state \nis called an equilibrium mixture.Equilibrium can be established for both physical processes and chemical reactions. The reaction may be \nfast or slow depending on the experimental conditions and \nthe nature of the reactants. When the reactants in a closed \nvessel at a particular temperature react to give products, \nthe concentrations of the reactants keep on decreasing, \nwhile those of products keep on increasing for some time \nafter which there is no change in the concentrations of either of the reactants or products. This stage of the \nsystem is the dynamic equilibrium and the rates of the forward and reverse reactions become equal. It is due to After studying this unit you will be able to • identify dynamic nature of  equilibrium involved in physical and chemical processes;• state the law of equilibrium; • explain characteristics of equilibria involved in physical and chemical processes;• write expressions for equilibrium \nconstants; • establish a relationship between \nKp and Kc;• explain various factors that \naffect the equilibrium state of a \nreaction;• classify substances as acids or \nbases according to Arrhenius, \nBronsted-Lowry and Lewis \nconcepts;• classify acids and bases as \nweak or strong in terms of their ionization constants; • explain the dependence of degree of ionization on concentration \nof the electrolyte and that of the common ion;• describe pH scale for representing hydrogen ion concentration;• explain ionisation of water and \nits duel role as acid and base;• describe ionic product (Kw ) and pKw  for water;• appreciate use of buffer solutions;• calculate solubility product \nconstant.Unit 6.indd   1689/12/2022   11:58:20 AM169this dynamic equilibrium stage that there is no change in the concentrations of various \nspecies in the reaction mixture. Based on the \nextent to which the reactions proceed to reach \nthe state of chemical equilibrium, these may be classified in three groups.(i) The reactions that proceed nearly to completion and only negligible concentrations of the reactants are \nleft. In some cases, it may not be even \npossible to detect these experimentally.(ii) The reactions in which only small \namounts of products are formed and most of the reactants remain unchanged \nat equilibrium stage.(iii) The reactions in which the concentrations \nof the reactants and products are comparable, when the system is in \nequilibrium.The extent of a reaction in equilibrium varies with the experimental conditions such as concentrations of reactants, temperature, \netc. Optimisation of the operational conditions \nis very important in industry and laboratory \nso that equilibrium is favorable in the \ndirection of the desired product. Some \nimportant aspects of equilibrium involving \nphysical and chemical processes are dealt in \nthis unit along with the equilibrium involving \nions in aqueous solutions which is called as \nionic equilibrium.6.1 EQUILIBRIUM IN PHYSICAL PROCESSESThe characteristics of system at equilibrium are better understood if we examine some physical processes. The most familiar examples \nare phase transformation processes, e.g., solid        liquid  liquid        gas solid         gas6.1.1 Solid-Liquid EquilibriumIce and water kept in a perfectly insulated �thermos flask (no exchange of heat between its contents and the surroundings) at 273K and the atmospheric pressure are in equilibrium \nstate and the system shows interesting characteristic features. We observe that the mass of ice and water do not change with \ntime and the temperature remains constant. \nHowever, the equilibrium is not static. \nThe intense activity can be noticed at the \nboundary between ice and water. Molecules \nfrom the liquid water collide against ice and \nadhere to it and some molecules of ice escape \ninto liquid phase. There is no change of mass \nof ice and water, as the rates of transfer of \nmolecules from ice into water and of reverse \ntransfer from water into ice are equal at \natmospheric pressure and 273 K. It is obvious that ice and water are in equilibrium only at particular temperature and pressure. For any pure substance at atmospheric pressure, the temperature at \nwhich the solid and liquid phases are at \nequilibrium is called the normal melting point \nor normal freezing point of the substance.  The system here is in dynamic equilibrium and we \ncan infer the following:\n(i) Both the opposing processes occur \nsimultaneously.(ii) Both the processes occur at the same \nrate so that the amount of ice and water remains constant.6.1.2 Liquid-Vapour EquilibriumThis equilibrium can be better understood if we consider the example of a transparent box \ncarrying a U-tube with mercury (manometer). \nDrying agent like anhydrous calcium chloride (or phosphorus penta-oxide) is placed for \na few hours in the box. After removing the \ndrying agent by tilting the box on one side, a \nwatch glass (or petri dish) containing water \nis quickly placed inside the box. It will be \nobserved that the mercury level in the right \nlimb of the manometer slowly increases and �finally attains a constant value, that is, the \npressure inside the box increases and reaches \na constant value. Also the volume of water in \nthe watch glass decreases (Fig. 6.1). Initially \nthere was no water vapour (or very less) inside \nthe box. As water evaporated the pressure in \nthe box increased due to addition of water molecules into the gaseous phase inside \nthe box. The rate of evaporation is constant. Unit 6.indd   1699/12/2022   11:58:20 AM170However, the rate of increase in pressure decreases with time due to condensation \nof vapour into water. Finally it leads to an \nequilibrium condition when there is no net \nevaporation. This implies that the number \nof water molecules from the gaseous state \ninto the liquid state also increases till the \nequilibrium is attained i.e.,rate of evaporation= rate of condensationH2O(l)          H2O (vap)At equilibrium the pressure exerted by the water molecules at a given temperature \nremains constant and is called the equilibrium \nvapour pressure of water (or just vapour \npressure of water); vapour pressure of water \nincreases with temperature. If the above \nexperiment is repeated with methyl alcohol, \nacetone and ether, it is observed that different \nliquids have different equilibrium vapour \npressures at the same temperature, and the \nliquid which has a higher vapour pressure is \nmore volatile and has a lower boiling point. If we expose three watch glasses containing separately 1mL each of acetone, ethyl alcohol, \nand water to atmosphere and repeat the \nexperiment with different volumes of the \nliquids in a warmer room, it is observed \nthat in all such cases the liquid eventually \ndisappears and the time taken for complete \nevaporation depends on (i) the nature of the \nliquid, (ii) the amount of the liquid and (iii) the \ntemperature. When the watch glass is open \nto the atmosphere, the rate of evaporation \nremains constant but the molecules are dispersed into large volume of the room. As \na consequence the rate of condensation from vapour to liquid state is much less than the rate of evaporation. These are open systems \nand it is not possible to reach equilibrium in \nan open system.Water and water vapour are in equilibrium position at atmospheric pressure (1.013 bar) \nand at 100°C in a closed vessel. The boiling \npoint of water is 100°C at 1.013 bar pressure. \nFor any pure liquid at one atmospheric \npressure (1.013 bar), the temperature \nat which the liquid and vapours are at \nequilibrium is called normal boiling point of \nthe liquid. Boiling point of the liquid depends \non the atmospheric pressure. It depends on \nthe altitude of the place; at high altitude the \nboiling point decreases. 6.1.3 Solid – Vapour EquilibriumLet us now consider the systems where solids sublime to vapour phase. If we place solid iodine in a closed vessel, after sometime �the vessel gets filled up with violet vapour \nand the intensity of colour increases with \ntime. After certain time the intensity of \ncolour becomes constant and at this stage \nequilibrium is attained. Hence solid iodine \nsublimes to give iodine vapour and the iodine \nvapour condenses to give solid iodine. The \nequilibrium can be represented as,I2(solid)   I2 (vapour)Other examples showing this kind of equilibrium are,Camphor (solid)  Camphor (vapour)NH4Cl (solid)   NH4Cl (vapour)Fig. 6.1  Measuring equilibrium vapour pressure of water at a constant temperatureUnit 6.indd   1709/12/2022   11:58:21 AM1716.1.4 Equilibrium Involving Dissolution of Solid or Gases in LiquidsSolids in liquidsWe know from our experience that we can dissolve only a limited amount of salt or sugar in a given amount of water at room \ntemperature. If we make a thick sugar syrup \nsolution by dissolving sugar at a higher \ntemperature, sugar crystals separate out if we \ncool the syrup to the room temperature. We call \nit a saturated solution when no more of solute \ncan be dissolved in it at a given  temperature. \nThe concentration of the solute in a saturated \nsolution depends upon the temperature. In \na saturated solution, a dynamic equilibrium \nexits between the solute molecules in the solid \nstate and in the solution:Sugar (solution)  Sugar (solid), and the rate of dissolution of sugar = rate of crystallisation of sugar.Equality of the two rates and dynamic nature of equilibrium has been confirmed with the help of radioactive sugar. If we drop some \nradioactive sugar into saturated solution of \nnon-radioactive sugar, then after some time \nradioactivity is observed both in the solution \nand in the solid sugar. Initially there were no \nradioactive sugar molecules in the solution \nbut due to dynamic nature of equilibrium, \nthere is exchange between the radioactive \nand non-radioactive sugar molecules between \nthe two phases. The ratio of the radioactive \nto non-radioactive molecules in the solution \nincreases till it attains a constant value.Gases in liquidsWhen a soda water bottle is opened, some of the carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it fizzes \nout rapidly. The phenomenon arises due \nto difference in solubility of carbon dioxide \nat different pressures. There is equilibrium \nbetween the molecules in the gaseous state \nand the molecules dissolved in the liquid under pressure i.e.,CO2 (gas)  CO2 (in solution)This equilibrium is governed by Henry’s law, which states that the mass of a gas dissolved in a given mass of a solvent at \nany temperature is proportional to the pressure of the gas above the solvent. This amount decreases with increase of \ntemperature. The soda water bottle is sealed \nunder pressure of gas when its solubility in \nwater is high. As soon as the bottle is opened, \nsome of the dissolved carbon dioxide gas \nescapes to reach a new equilibrium condition \nrequired for the lower pressure, namely its \npartial pressure in the atmosphere. This is \nhow the soda water in bottle when left open to the air for some time, turns ‘flat’. It can be \ngeneralised that:(i) For solid  liquid equilibrium, there is only one temperature (melting point) at  1 atm (1.013 bar) at which the two phases can coexist. If there is no \nexchange of heat with the surroundings, \nthe mass of the two phases remains \nconstant.(ii) For liquid  vapour equilibrium, the vapour pressure is constant at a given \ntemperature.(iii) For dissolution of solids in liquids, \nthe solubility is constant at a given temperature.(iv) For dissolution of gases in liquids, \nthe concentration of a gas in liquid is proportional to the pressure \n(concentration) of the gas over the liquid. \nThese observations are summarised in \nTable 6.1Table 6.1 Some Features of Physical EquilibriaProcessConclusionLiquid VapourH2O (l)  H2O (g)pH2Oconstant at given temperatureSolid  LiquidH2O (s)  H2O (l)Melting point is fixed at constant pressureSolute(s)  Solute(solution)Sugar(s)  Sugar(solution)Concentration of solutein solution is constant\nat a given temperatureGas(g)  Gas (aq)CO2(g)  CO2(aq)[gas(aq)]/[gas(g)] is constant at a given \ntemperature  \n[CO2(aq)]/[CO2(g)] is constant at a given \ntemperature Unit 6.indd   17111/2/2022   4:10:42 PM1726.1.5 General Characteristics of Equilibria Involving Physical \nProcessesFor the physical processes discussed above, \nfollowing characteristics are common to the \nsystem at equilibrium:(i) Equilibrium is possible only in a closed system at a given temperature.(ii) Both the opposing processes occur at \nthe same rate and there is a dynamic \nbut stable condition.(iii) All measurable properties of the system \nremain constant.(iv) When equilibrium is attained for a \nphysical process, it is characterised by \nconstant value of one of its parameters at a given temperature. Table 6.1 lists \nsuch quantities.(v) The magnitude of such quantities at any \nstage indicates the extent to which the \nphysical process has proceeded before \nreaching equilibrium.6.2 EQUILIBRIUM IN CHEMICAL \nPROCESSES – DYNAMIC \nEQUILIBRIUMAnalogous to the physical systems chemical \nreactions also attain a state of equilibrium. \nThese reactions can occur both in forward \nand backward directions. When the rates of the forward and reverse reactions become \nequal, the concentrations of the reactants \nand the products remain constant. This \nis the stage of chemical equilibrium. This \nequilibrium is dynamic in nature as it consists \nof a forward reaction in which the reactants \ngive product(s) and reverse reaction in which \nproduct(s) gives the original reactants.For a better comprehension, let us consider a general case of a reversible reaction, A + B  C + DWith passage of time, there is accumulation of the products C and D and depletion of the reactants A and B (Fig. 6.2). This leads to a decrease in the rate of \nforward reaction and an increase in the rate \nof the reverse reaction,Fig. 6.2  Attainment of chemical equilibrium.Eventually, the two reactions occur at the same rate and the system reaches a state of equilibrium. Similarly, the reaction can reach the state of equilibrium even if we start with only C and \nD; that is, no A and B being present initially, \nas the equilibrium can be reached from either \ndirection.The dynamic nature of chemical equilibrium can be demonstrated in the \nsynthesis of ammonia by Haber’s process.  \nIn a series of experiments, Haber started \nwith known amounts of dinitrogen and \ndihydrogen maintained at high temperature \nand pressure and at regular intervals \ndetermined the amount of ammonia present. \nHe was successful in determining also the \nconcentration of unreacted dihydrogen and \ndinitrogen. Fig. 6.4 (page 174) shows that after \na certain time the composition of the mixture \nremains the same even though some of the \nreactants are still present. This constancy in \ncomposition indicates that the reaction has \nreached equilibrium. In order to understand \nthe dynamic nature of the reaction, synthesis \nof ammonia is carried out with exactly the \nsame starting conditions (of partial pressure \nand temperature) but using D2 (deuterium) in place of H2. The reaction mixtures starting either with H2 or D2 reach equilibrium with the same composition, except that D2 and ND3 are present instead of H2 and NH3.  After Unit 6.indd   17211/2/2022   4:10:43 PM173Dynamic Equilibrium – A Student’s ActivityEquilibrium whether in a physical or in a chemical system, is always of dynamic nature. This can be demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible in a school laboratory. \nHowever this concept can be easily comprehended by performing the following activity. The activity \ncan be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students.Take two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes each of 30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of 3-5mm. Fill \nnearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this purpose add a crystal \nof potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder (number 2) empty. Put one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder 1, close its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its lower portion to \ncylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2nd cylinder, transfer the coloured water in a similar manner from cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring coloured water using the two glass \ntubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you notice that the level of coloured water in both \nthe cylinders becomes constant.If you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will not be any further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take analogy of ‘level’ of \ncoloured water with ‘concentration’ of reactants and products in the two cylinders, we can say \nthe process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy of level, is indicative of dynamic �nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking two tubes of different diameters we find \nthat at equilibrium the level of coloured water in two cylinders is different. How far diameters are \nresponsible for change in levels in two cylinders? Empty cylinder (2) is an indicator of no product \nin it at the beginning.

If we start with equal initial concentration of H2 and I2, the reaction proceeds in the forward direction and the concentration of H2 and I2 decreases while that of HI increases, until all of these \nbecome constant at equilibrium (Fig. 6.5). We \ncan also start with HI alone and make the \nreaction to proceed in the reverse direction; \nthe concentration of HI will decrease and \nconcentration of H2 and I2 will increase until they all become constant when equilibrium is \nreached (Fig. 6.5).  If total number of H and I \natoms are same in a given volume, the same \nequilibrium mixture is obtained whether we \nstart it from pure reactants or pure product.equilibrium is attained, these two mixtures  (H2, N2, NH3 and D2, N2, ND3) are mixed together and left for a while.  Later, when this mixture is analysed, it is found that the \nconcentration of ammonia is just the same \nas before. However, when this mixture is \nanalysed by a mass spectrometer, it is found \nthat ammonia and all deuterium containing \nforms of ammonia (NH3, NH2D, NHD2 and ND3) and dihydrogen and its deutrated forms  (H2, HD and D2) are present. Thus one can conclude that scrambling of H and D atoms in \nthe molecules must result from a continuation \nof the forward and reverse reactions in the \nmixture. If the reaction had simply stopped \nwhen they reached equilibrium, then there \nwould have been no mixing of isotopes in \nthis way.Use of isotope (deuterium) in the formation of ammonia clearly indicates that chemical \nreactions reach a state of dynamic \nequilibrium in which the rates of forward \nand reverse reactions are equal and there \nis no net change in composition.  Equilibrium can be attained from both sides, whether we start reaction by taking, \nH2(g) and N2(g) and get NH3(g) or by taking NH3(g) and decomposing it into N2(g) and H2(g).N2(g) + 3H2(g)  2NH3(g)  Fig. 6.5  Chemical equilibrium in the reaction H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g) can be attained from either directionFig. 6.4 Depiction of equilibrium for the reaction6.3 LAW OF CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM AND EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTA mixture of reactants and products in the equilibrium state is called an equilibrium \nmixture. In this section we shall address a number of important questions about the \ncomposition of equilibrium mixtures: What is \nthe relationship between the concentrations \nof reactants and products in an equilibrium \nmixture? How can we determine equilibrium \nconcentrations from initial concentrations? \nWhat factors can be exploited to alter the NgHgNHg22332\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001e\u001f\u001eUnit 6.indd   1749/12/2022   11:58:21 AM175composition of an equilibrium mixture? The last question in particular is important when \nchoosing conditions for synthesis of industrial \nchemicals such as H2, NH3, CaO etc.To answer these questions, let us consider a general reversible reaction:A + B  C + Dwhere A and B are the reactants, C and D \nare the products in the balanced chemical \nequation. On the basis of experimental studies \nof many reversible reactions, the Norwegian \nchemists Cato Maximillian Guldberg and \nPeter Waage proposed in 1864 that the \nconcentrations in an equilibrium mixture \nare related by the following equilibrium \nequation,  Kc\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001dCDAB                (6.1)  (6.1) where Kc is the equilibrium constant and the expression on the right side is called the \nequilibrium constant expression.The equilibrium equation is also known as the law of mass action because in the early days of chemistry, concentration was called \n“active mass”. In order to appreciate their \nwork better, let us consider reaction between \ngaseous H2 and I2 carried out in a sealed vessel at 731K. H2(g)   +   I2(g)   2HI(g) 1 mol    1 mol          2 molSix sets of experiments with varying initial conditions were performed, starting with only gaseous H2 and I2 in a sealed reaction vessel in first four experiments (1, 2, 3 and 4) and \nonly HI in other two experiments (5 and 6). \nExperiment 1, 2, 3 and 4 were performed \ntaking different concentrations of H2 and / or I2, and with time it was observed that intensity of the purple colour remained constant and \nequilibrium was attained. Similarly, for \nexperiments 5 and 6, the equilibrium was \nattained from the opposite direction.Data obtained from all six sets of experiments are given in Table 6.2.It is evident from the experiments 1, 2, 3 and 4 that number of moles of dihydrogen \nreacted = number of moles of iodine reacted \n= ½ (number of moles of HI formed). Also, \nexperiments 5 and 6 indicate that,[H2(g)]eq = [I2(g)]eqKnowing the above facts, in order to establish a relationship between \nconcentrations of the reactants and products, \nseveral combinations can be tried. Let us \nconsider the simple expression,[HI(g)]eq / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eqIt can be seen from Table 6.3 that if we put the equilibrium concentrations of the \nreactants and products, the above expression Table 6.2  Initial and Equilibrium Concentrations of H2, I2 and HIUnit 6.indd   1759/12/2022   11:58:21 AM176is far from  constant. However, if we consider the expression,[HI(g)]2eq / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eqwe find that this expression gives constant \nvalue (as shown in Table 6.3) in all the six \ncases. It can be seen that in this expression \nthe power of the concentration for reactants \nand products are actually the stoichiometric �coefficients in the equation for the chemical \nreaction. Thus, for the reaction H2(g) + I2(g)   2HI(g), following equation 6.1, the equilibrium \nconstant Kc is written as,Kc  = [HI(g)]eq2 / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eq                   (6.2)Generally the subscript ‘eq’ (used for equilibrium) is omitted from the concentration \nterms. It is taken for granted that the \nconcentrations in the expression for Kc are equilibrium values. We, therefore, write,Kc  = [HI(g)]2 / [H2(g)] [I2(g)]                 (6.3)The subscript ‘c’ indicates that Kc is expressed in concentrations of mol L–1. At a given temperature, the product of concentrations of the reaction products \nraised to the respective stoichiometric \ncoefficient in the balanced chemical \nequation divided by the product of \nconcentrations of the reactants raised to �their individual stoichiometric coefficients \nhas a constant value. This is known as the Equilibrium Law or Law of Chemical Equilibrium.The equilibrium constant for a general reaction,a A   +  b B  c C  +  d Dis expressed as,Kc  = [C]c[D]d / [A]a[B]b                                       (6.4)where [A], [B], [C] and [D] are the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products.Equilibrium constant for the reaction,4NH3(g) + 5O2(g)  4NO(g) + 6H2O(g) is written as Kc  = [NO]4[H2O]6 / [NH3]4 [O2]5  Molar concentration of different species is indicated by enclosing these in square bracket and, as mentioned above, it is implied that \nthese are equilibrium concentrations. While \nwriting expression for equilibrium constant, \nsymbol for phases (s, l, g) are generally ignored. Let us write equilibrium constant for the reaction, H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g)               (6.5)as,  Kc = [HI]2 / [H2] [I2] = x                (6.6)The equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction, 2HI(g)  H2(g) + I2(g), at the same temperature is,K′c = [H2] [I2] / [HI]2 = 1/ x = 1 / Kc                (6.7)Thus, K′c = 1 / Kc                                                    (6.8)Equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction is the inverse of the equilibrium constant for the reaction in the forward \ndirection.If we change the stoichiometric coefficients in a chemical equation by multiplying \nthroughout by a factor then we must make \nsure that the expression for equilibrium \nconstant also reflects that change. For \nexample, if the  reaction (6.5) is written as,½ H2(g) + ½ I2(g)  HI(g)                   (6.9)the equilibrium constant for the above reaction is given byK″c   =  [HI] / [H2]1/2[I2]1/2 = {[HI]2 / [H2][I2]}1/2                                 = x1/2 = Kc1/2 (6.10)On multiplying the equation (6.5) by n, we getTable 6.3 Expression Involving the Equilibrium Concentration of Reactants H2(g) + I2(g)       2HI(g)Unit 6.indd   1769/12/2022   11:58:22 AM177nH2(g) +  nI2(g) D  2nHI(g)                 (6.11)Therefore, equilibrium constant for the reaction is equal to Kc n. These findings are summarised in Table 6.4. It should be noted that because the equilibrium constants Kc  and K′c have different numerical values, it is important to specify the form of the balanced \nchemical equation when quoting the value of \nan equilibrium constant.N2(g) + O2(g)  2NO(g)SolutionFor the reaction equilibrium constant, Kc can be written as,Kc = NO= 2.810M–322223330104210NOMM..=  0.622Problem 6.1The following concentrations were obtained for the formation of NH3 from N2 and H2 at equilibrium at 500K.

We shall now consider equilibrium constant for some \nhomogeneous reactions.6.4.1 Equilibrium Constant in Gaseous SystemsSo far we have expressed equilibrium constant of the reactions in terms of molar �concentration of the reactants and products, �and used symbol, Kc for it. For reactions involving gases, however, it is usually more \nconvenient to express the equilibrium \nconstant in terms of partial pressure.The ideal gas equation is written as,pV = nRT ⇒pnVT=RHere, p is the pressure in Pa, n is the number of moles of the gas, V is the volume in m3 and T is the temperature in Kelvin178Therefore, n/V is concentration expressed  in mol/m3If concentration c, is in mol/L or mol/dm3, and p is in bar thenp = cRT,\nWe can also write p = [gas]RT.Here, R= 0.0831 bar litre/mol KAt constant temperature, the pressure of the gas is proportional to its concentration i.e.,\np ∝ [gas]\nFor reaction in equilibrium     H2(g) +  I2(g)    2HI(g)We can write eitherKcHIgHgIg = ()\n()()222orKpppcHIHI = ()()()222                             (6.12)Further, since  pT                         pHIIHIgR=()\n\n22222=()\n\n=()IgRHgRHT                        pTTherefore, KpppTTp=()()()()\n[]()\n\n()\n\nHIHIggg2222222 = HIRHRI.RRT = HIHIggg()\n\n()()=222Kc             (6.13)In this example, Kp = Kc i.e., both equilibrium constants are equal.

The equilibrium between water vapour and \nliquid water in a closed container is an \nexample of heterogeneous equilibrium.H2O(l)  H2O(g)In this example, there is a gas phase and a liquid phase. In the same way, equilibrium \nbetween a solid and its saturated solution,Ca(OH)2 (s) + (aq)  Ca2+ (aq) + 2OH–(aq)is a heterogeneous equilibrium.Heterogeneous equilibria often involve pure solids or liquids. We can simplify equilibrium expressions for the heterogeneous \nequilibria involving a pure liquid or a pure \nsolid, as the molar concentration of a pure \nsolid or liquid is constant (i.e., independent \nof the amount present). In other words if a \nsubstance ‘X’ is involved, then [X(s)] and [X(l)] \nare constant, whatever the amount of ‘X’ is \ntaken. Contrary to this, [X(g)] and [X(aq)] will Unit 6.indd   1799/12/2022   11:58:24 AM180vary as the amount of X in a given volume varies. Let us take thermal dissociation of \ncalcium carbonate which is an interesting and \nimportant example of heterogeneous chemical \nequilibrium.CaCO3 (s)   CaO (s) + CO2 (g)     (6.16)On the basis of the stoichiometric equation, we can write,Kc\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\n\u0019\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\n\u0019\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019CaOsCOgCaCOs23Since [CaCO3(s)] and [CaO(s)] are both constant, therefore modified equilibrium constant for the thermal decomposition of \ncalcium carbonate will beK´c = [CO2(g)]                                  (6.17) or Kp = pCO2                                                           (6.18)This shows that at a particular temperature, there is a constant concentration \nor pressure of CO2 in equilibrium with CaO(s) and CaCO3(s). Experimentally it has been found that at 1100 K, the pressure of CO2 in equilibrium with CaCO3(s) and CaO(s), is  2.0 ×105 Pa. Therefore, equilibrium constant at 1100K for the above reaction is:Kp = PCO2 = 2 × 105 Pa/105 Pa = 2.00Similarly, in the equilibrium between nickel, carbon monoxide and nickel carbonyl �(used in the purification of nickel),Ni (s) + 4 CO (g)   Ni(CO)4 (g),the equilibrium constant is written asKc\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\n\u0019\u0018\u0017NiCOCO44It must be remembered that for the existence of heterogeneous equilibrium pure solids or liquids must also be present (however \nsmall the amount may be) at equilibrium, but \ntheir concentrations or partial pressures do \nnot appear in the expression of the equilibrium \nconstant. In the reaction,\nAg2O(s) + 2HNO3(aq)  2AgNO3(aq) +H2O(l)Kc = AgNO3\u001f\u001e\u001f\u001e\u0018\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001b\u001aUnits of Equilibrium ConstantThe value of equilibrium constant Kc can be calculated by substituting the concentration \nterms in mol/L and for Kp partial pressure is substituted in Pa, kPa, bar or atm. This \nresults in units of equilibrium constant based \non molarity or pressure, unless the exponents \nof both the numerator and denominator are \nsame.For the reactions,H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI, Kc and Kp have no unit.N2O4(g)  2NO2 (g), Kc has unit mol/L and Kp has unit barEquilibrium constants can also be expressed as dimensionless quantities if the standard state of reactants and products �are specified. For a pure gas, the standard \nstate is 1bar. Therefore a pressure of 4 bar \nin standard state can be expressed as 4 \nbar/1 bar = 4, which is a dimensionless \nnumber. Standard state (c0) for a solute is 1 molar solution and all concentrations can be \nmeasured with respect to it. The numerical \nvalue of equilibrium constant depends on the \nstandard state chosen. Thus, in this system \nboth Kp and Kc are dimensionless quantities but have different numerical values due to \ndifferent standard states. Problem 6.6The value of Kp for the reaction, CO2 (g) + C (s)  2CO (g)is 3.0 at 1000 K. If initially PCO2 = 0.48 bar and PCO = 0 bar and pure graphite is present, calculate the equilibrium partial pressures of CO and CO2.SolutionFor the reaction,\nlet ‘x’ be the decrease in pressure of CO2, then           CO2(g)  +  C(s)  2CO(g)Initial    pressure: 0.48 bar          0Unit 6.indd   1809/12/2022   11:58:24 AM181At equilibrium:             (0.48 – x)bar             2x barKp=ppCOCO22Kp = (2x)2/(0.48 – x) = 34x2 = 3(0.48 – x)4x2 = 1.44 – x4x2 + 3x – 1.44 = 0a = 4, b = 3, c = –1.44xbbaca\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001c\u001b242= [–3 ± √(3)2– 4(4)(–1.44)]/2 × 4=  (–3 ± 5.66)/8= (–3 + 5.66)/8 (as value of x cannot be negative hence we neglect that value)x = 2.66/8 = 0.33\nThe equilibrium partial pressures are,\npCO2= 2x = 2 × 0.33 = 0.66 barpCO2= 0.48 – x = 0.48 – 0.33 = 0.15 bar5. The equilibrium constant K for a reaction is related to the equilibrium constant of the corresponding reaction, whose \nequation is obtained by multiplying or \ndividing the equation for the original \nreaction by a small integer.Let us consider applications of equilibrium constant to:•\tpredict the extent of a reaction on the basis of its magnitude,•\tpredict the direction of the reaction, and•\tcalculate equilibrium concentrations.6.6.1 Predicting the Extent of a ReactionThe numerical value of the equilibrium constant for a reaction indicates the extent \nof the reaction. But it is important to note \nthat an equilibrium constant does not give \nany information about the rate at which \nthe equilibrium is reached. The magnitude \nof Kc or Kp is directly proportional to the concentrations of products (as these appear \nin the numerator of equilibrium constant \nexpression) and inversely proportional to the \nconcentrations of the reactants (these appear \nin the denominator). This implies that a high \nvalue of K is suggestive of a high concentration of products and vice-versa.We can make the following generalisations concerning the composition of equilibrium \nmixtures:•\tIf Kc \u003e 103, products predominate over reactants, i.e., if Kc is very large, the reaction proceeds nearly to completion. \nConsider the following examples:(a)  The reaction of H2 with O2 at 500 K has a very large equilibrium constant,  Kc = 2.4 × 1047.(b)  H2(g) + Cl2(g)  2HCl(g) at 300K has  Kc = 4.0 × 1031. (c) H2(g) + Br2(g)  2HBr (g) at 300 K,  Kc = 5.4 × 1018•\tIf Kc \u003c 10–3, reactants predominate over products, i.e., if Kc is very small, the reaction proceeds rarely. Consider the \nfollowing examples:6.6 APPLICATIONS OF EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTSBefore considering the applications of \nequilibrium constants, let us summarise the important features of equilibrium constants \nas follows:1. Expression for equilibrium constant is applicable only when concentrations of \nthe reactants and products have attained constant value at equilibrium state.2. The value of equilibrium constant is \nindependent of initial concentrations of \nthe reactants and products.3. Equilibrium constant is temperature dependent having one unique value for a particular reaction represented by a \nbalanced equation at a given temperature.4. The equilibrium constant for the reverse \nreaction is equal to the inverse of the \nequilibrium constant for the forward reaction.Unit 6.indd   1819/12/2022   11:58:24 AM182(a)  The decomposition of H2O into H2 and O2 at 500 K has a very small equilibrium constant, Kc = 4.1 × 10–48(b) N2(g)  +  O2(g)  2NO(g),  at 298 K has Kc = 4.8 ×10–31.•\tIf Kc is in the range of 10–3 to 103, appreciable concentrations of both reactants and products are present. \nConsider the following examples:(a)  For reaction of H2 with I2 to give HI,  Kc = 57.0 at 700K.(b)  Also, gas phase decomposition of N2O4 to NO2 is another reaction with a value of Kc = 4.64 × 10–3 at 25°C which is neither too small nor too large. Hence, \nequilibrium mixtures contain appreciable \nconcentrations of both N2O4 and NO2. These generarlisations are illustrated in \nFig. 6.6If Qc = Kc, the reaction mixture is already at equilibrium.Consider the gaseous reaction of H2  with I2,H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g); Kc = 57.0 at 700 K.Suppose we have molar concentrations [H2]t=0.10M, [I2]t = 0.20 M and [HI]t = 0.40 M.(the subscript t on the concentration symbols \nmeans that the concentrations were measured \nat some arbitrary time t, not necessarily at \nequilibrium). Thus, the reaction quotient, Qc at this stage of the reaction is given by,\nQc = [HI]t2 / [H2]t [I2]t  = (0.40)2/ (0.10)×(0.20)                            = 8.0Now, in this case, Qc (8.0) does not equal Kc (57.0), so the mixture of H2(g), I2(g) and HI(g) is not at equilibrium; that is, more H2(g) and I2(g) will react to form more HI(g) and their concentrations will decrease till Qc = Kc.The reaction quotient, Qc is useful in predicting the direction of reaction by comparing the values of Qc and Kc.Thus, we can make the following generalisations concerning the direction of the reaction (Fig. 6.7) :Fig.6.6 Dependence of extent of reaction on Kc 6.6.2 Predicting the Direction of the ReactionThe equilibrium constant helps in predicting the direction in which a given reaction will proceed at any stage. For this purpose, \nwe calculate the reaction quotient Q. The reaction quotient, Q (Qc with molar concentrations and QP with partial pressures) is defined in the same way as the equilibrium \nconstant Kc except that the concentrations in Qc are not necessarily equilibrium values.  For a general reaction:a A + b B    c C + d D        (6.19)Qc = [C]c[D]d / [A]a[B]b                  (6.20)Then, If Qc \u003e Kc, the reaction will proceed in the direction of reactants (reverse reaction).If Qc \u003c Kc, the reaction will proceed in the direction of the products (forward reaction).Fig. 6.7  Predicting the direction of the reaction•\tIf Qc \u003c Kc, net reaction goes from left to right•\tIf Qc \u003e Kc, net reaction goes from right to left.•\tIf Qc = Kc, no net reaction occurs.Problem 6.7The value of Kc for the reaction2A  B + C is 2 × 10–3.

Write the balanced equation for the reaction.Step 2. Under the balanced equation, make a table that lists for each substance involved in the reaction:(a) the initial concentration,(b) the change in concentration on going to equilibrium, and(c) the equilibrium concentration.In constructing the table, define x as the concentration (mol/L) of one of the substances that reacts on going to equilibrium, then use \nthe stoichiometry of the reaction to determine \nthe concentrations of the other substances in \nterms of x.Step 3. Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium equation for the reaction and solve for x. If you are \nto solve a quadratic equation choose the \nmathematical solution that makes chemical \nsense.Step 4. Calculate the equilibrium concentrations from the calculated value of x.Step 5. Check your results by substituting them into the equilibrium equation.Problem 6.813.8g of N2O4 was placed in a 1L reaction vessel at 400K and allowed to attain equilibriumN2O4 (g) 2NO2 (g)Unit 6.indd   1839/12/2022   11:58:25 AM184Let x mol per litre of PCl5 be dissociated,At equilibrium:    (3-x)      x       xKc = [PCl3][Cl2]/[PCl5]1.8 = x2/ (3 – x)x2 + 1.8x – 5.4 = 0x = [–1.8 ± √(1.8)2 – 4(–5.4)]/2x = [–1.8 ± √3.24 + 21.6]/2x = [–1.8 ± 4.98]/2x = [–1.8 + 4.98]/2 = 1.59\n[PCl5] = 3.0 – x = 3 –1.59 = 1.41 M[PCl3] = [Cl2] = x = 1.59 MTaking antilog of both sides, we get,  K = e–∆G/RT                 (6.23)Hence, using the equation (6.23), the reaction spontaneity can be interpreted in terms of the value of ∆G .•\tIf ∆G  \u003c 0, then –∆G /RT is positive, and e –∆DG /RT\u003e1, making K \u003e1, which implies a spontaneous reaction or the reaction which proceeds in the forward \ndirection to such an extent that the products are present predominantly.•\tIf ∆G  \u003e 0, then –∆G /RT is negative, and  e –∆G \u003c/RT 1, that is , K \u003c 1, which implies a non-spontaneous reaction or a reaction \nwhich proceeds in the forward direction \nto such a small degree that only a very \nminute quantity of product is formed.Problem 6.10The value of ∆G  for the phosphorylation of glucose in glycolysis is 13.8 kJ/mol.

However, as you have studied in Unit 5, it is directly related  to the thermodynamics of the reaction and  in particular, to the change in Gibbs energy, �∆G. If,•\t∆G is negative, then the reaction is spontaneous and proceeds in the forward direction.•\t∆G is positive, then reaction is considered \nnon-spontaneous. Instead, as reverse \nreaction would have a negative ∆G, the products of the forward reaction shall be \nconverted to the reactants.•\t∆G is 0, reaction has achieved equilibrium; at this point, there is no longer any free \nenergy left to drive the reaction.A mathematical expression of this thermodynamic view of equilibrium can be described by the following equation:∆G  = ∆G + RT lnQ                                    (6.21)where, G is standard Gibbs energy. At equilibrium, when ∆G = 0 and Q = Kc, the equation (6.21) becomes,∆G = ∆G + RT ln K = 0∆G = – RT lnK                                      (6.22)lnK = – ∆G / RTUnit 6.indd   1849/12/2022   11:58:25 AM185Fig. 6.8 Effect of addition of H2 on change of concentration for the reactants and products in the reaction,  H2(g) + I2 (g)  2HI(g)reactants to products while minimising the expenditure of energy. This implies maximum \nyield of products at mild temperature and \npressure conditions. If it does not happen, \nthen the experimental conditions need to be \nadjusted. For example, in the Haber process \nfor the synthesis of ammonia from N2 and H2, the choice of experimental conditions is of real economic importance. Annual world  \nproduction of ammonia is about hundred \nmillion tones, primarily for use as fertilisers.Equilibrium constant, Kc is independent of initial concentrations. But if a system at \nequilibrium is subjected to a change in the \nconcentration of one or more of the reacting \nsubstances, then the system is no longer at \nequilibrium; and net reaction takes place in \nsome direction until the system returns to \nequilibrium once again. Similarly, a change \nin temperature or pressure of the system may \nalso alter the equilibrium. In order to decide \nwhat course the reaction adopts and make \na qualitative prediction about the effect of a \nchange in conditions on equilibrium we use \nLe Chatelier’s principle. It states that a \nchange in any of the factors that determine \nthe equilibrium conditions of a system \nwill cause the system to change in such a \nmanner so as to reduce or to counteract \nthe effect of the change. This is applicable \nto all physical and chemical equilibria. We shall now be discussing factors which can influence the equilibrium.6.8.1 Effect of Concentration ChangeIn general, when equilibrium is disturbed by the addition/removal of any reactant/products, Le Chatelier’s principle predicts \nthat:• The concentration stress of an added reactant/product is relieved by net reaction in the direction that consumes the added substance.• The concentration stress of a removed \nreactant/product is relieved by net \nreaction in the direction that replenishes the removed substance. or in other words, “When the concentration of any of the reactants or products in a reaction at equilibrium is changed, the composition of the equilibrium mixture changes so as \nto minimize the effect of concentration \nchanges”. Let us take the reaction,H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g)If H2 is added to the reaction mixture at equilibrium, then the equilibrium of the reaction is disturbed. In order to restore it, \nthe reaction proceeds in a direction wherein \nH2 is consumed, i.e.,  more of H2 and I2 react to form HI and finally the equilibrium shifts \nin right (forward) direction (Fig.6.8). This is in \naccordance with the Le Chatelier’s principle \nwhich implies that in case of addition of a \nreactant/product, a new equilibrium will \nbe set up in which the concentration of the \nreactant/product should be less than what it \nwas after the addition but more than what it \nwas in the original mixture.The same point can be explained in terms of the reaction quotient, Qc,Qc = [HI]2/ [H2][I2]Unit 6.indd   18511/30/2022   15:48:33186Addition of hydrogen at equilibrium results in value of Qc being less than Kc . Thus, in order to attain equilibrium again reaction moves in the forward direction. Similarly, \nwe can say that removal of a product also \nboosts the forward reaction and increases \nthe concentration of the products and this \nhas great commercial application in cases \nof reactions, where the product is a gas or a \nvolatile substance. In case of manufacture of �ammonia, ammonia is liquified and removed \nfrom the reaction mixture so that reaction \nkeeps moving in forward direction. Similarly, \nin the large scale production of CaO (used \nas important building material) from CaCO3, constant removal of CO2 from the kiln drives the reaction to completion. It should be \nremembered that continuous removal of a \nproduct maintains Qc at a value less than Kc and reaction continues to move in the forward \ndirection.Effect of Concentration – An experimentThis can be demonstrated by the following reaction: Fe3+(aq)+ SCN–(aq)  [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)        (6.24)yellow      colourless      deep red        (6.25)A reddish colour appears on adding two drops of 0.002 M potassium thiocynate solution to 1 mL of 0.2 M iron(III) nitrate solution due to the formation of [Fe(SCN)]2+. The intensity of the red colour becomes constant on \nattaining equilibrium. This equilibrium can be \nshifted in either forward or reverse directions \ndepending on our choice of adding a reactant \nor a product. The equilibrium can be shifted \nin the opposite direction by adding reagents \nthat remove Fe3+ or SCN– ions. For example, oxalic acid (H2C2O4), reacts with Fe3+ ions to form the stable complex ion [Fe(C2O4)3]3–, thus decreasing the concentration of free \nFe3+(aq). In accordance with the Le Chatelier’s principle, the concentration stress of removed \nFe3+ is relieved by dissociation of [Fe(SCN)]2+ to replenish the Fe3+ ions. Because the concentration of [Fe(SCN)]2+ decreases, the intensity of red colour decreases.Addition of aq. HgCl2 also decreases red colour because Hg2+ reacts with SCN– ions to form stable complex ion [Hg(SCN)4]2–. Removal of free SCN– (aq) shifts the equilibrium in equation (6.24) from right to left to replenish SCN– ions.  Addition of potassium thiocyanate on the other hand increases the \ncolour intensity of the solution as it shift the \nequilibrium to right.6.8.2 Effect of Pressure ChangeA pressure change obtained by changing the volume can affect the yield of products in \ncase of a gaseous reaction where the total number of moles of gaseous reactants and \ntotal number of moles of gaseous products are \ndifferent. In applying Le Chatelier’s principle \nto a heterogeneous equilibrium the effect \nof pressure changes on solids and liquids \ncan be ignored because the volume (and \nconcentration) of a solution/liquid is nearly \nindependent of pressure.Consider the reaction,CO(g) + 3H2(g)  CH4(g) + H2O(g)Here, 4 mol of gaseous reactants (CO + 3H2) become 2 mol of gaseous products (CH4 + H2O). Suppose equilibrium mixture (for above reaction) kept in a cylinder fitted with a piston at constant temperature is compressed to \none half of its original volume. Then, total \npressure will be doubled (according to  pV = constant). The partial pressure and \ntherefore, concentration of reactants and \nproducts have changed and the mixture is no \nlonger at equilibrium. The direction in which \nthe reaction goes to re-establish equilibrium \ncan be predicted by applying the Le Chatelier’s \nprinciple. Since pressure has doubled, \nthe equilibrium now shifts in the forward \ndirection, a direction in which the number \nof moles of the gas or pressure decreases (we \nknow pressure is proportional to moles of the \ngas). This can also be understood by using \nreaction quotient, Qc. Let [CO], [H2], [CH4] and [H2O] be the molar concentrations at equilibrium for methanation reaction. When volume of the reaction mixture is halved, the Unit 6.indd   1869/12/2022   11:58:25 AM187Fig. 6.9 Effect of temperature on equilibrium for the reaction, 2NO2 (g)  N2O4 (g)partial pressure and the concentration are doubled. We obtain the reaction quotient by \nreplacing each equilibrium concentration by double its value.Qc=()\n()\n\n()()CHgHOgCOgHg4223As Qc \u003c Kc , the reaction proceeds in the forward direction.In reaction C(s) + CO2(g)  2CO(g), when pressure is increased, the reaction goes in the reverse direction because the number of moles \nof gas increases in the forward direction.6.8.3 Effect of Inert Gas AdditionIf the volume is kept constant and an inert gas such as argon is added which does not take \npart in the reaction, the equilibrium remains \nundisturbed. It is because the addition of an inert gas at constant volume does not \nchange the partial pressures or the molar \nconcentrations of the substance involved in \nthe reaction. The reaction quotient changes \nonly if the added gas is a reactant or product \ninvolved in the reaction.6.8.4 Effect of Temperature ChangeWhenever an equilibrium is disturbed by a change in the concentration, pressure or \nvolume, the composition of the equilibrium mixture changes because the reaction \nquotient, Qc no longer equals the equilibrium constant, Kc. However, when a change in temperature occurs, the value of equilibrium \nconstant, Kc  is changed.In general, the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant depends on the sign of ∆H for the reaction.•\tThe equilibrium constant for an exothermic reaction (negative ∆H) decreases as the temperature increases.•\tThe equilibrium constant for an \nendothermic reaction (positive ∆H) increases as the temperature increases.Temperature changes affect the equilibrium constant and rates of reactions. Production of ammonia according to the reaction,N2(g) + 3H2(g)  2NH3(g); ∆H= – 92.38 kJ mol–1is an exothermic process. According to  Le Chatelier’s principle, raising the temperature shifts the equilibrium to left \nand decreases the equilibrium concentration \nof ammonia. In other words, low temperature \nis favourable for high yield of ammonia, but \npractically very low temperatures slow down \nthe reaction and thus a catalyst is used.Effect of Temperature – An experimentEffect of temperature on equilibrium can be demonstrated by taking NO2 gas (brown in colour) which dimerises into N2O4 gas (colourless).2NO2(g)  N2O4(g); ∆H = –57.2 kJ mol–1NO2 gas prepared by addition of Cu turnings to conc. HNO3 is collected in two  5 mL test tubes (ensuring same intensity \nof colour of gas in each tube) and stopper \nsealed with araldite. Three 250 mL beakers \n1, 2 and 3 containing freesing mixture, water \nat room temperature and hot water (363K), \nrespectively, are taken (Fig. 6.9). Both the test \ntubes are placed in beaker 2 for 8-10 minutes. \nAfter this one is placed in beaker 1 and the \nother in beaker  3. The effect of temperature \non direction of reaction is depicted very well \nin this experiment. At low temperatures in \nbeaker 1, the forward reaction of formation of \nN2O4 is preferred, as reaction is exothermic, and thus, intensity of brown colour due \nto NO2 decreases. While in beaker 3, high temperature favours the reverse reaction of Unit 6.indd   18711/2/2022   4:11:28 PM188formation of NO2 and thus, the brown colour intensifies.Effect of temperature can also be seen in an endothermic reaction,[Co(H2O)6]3+(aq) + 4Cl–(aq)[CoCl4 ]2–(aq) +                                                                  6H2O(l) pink  colourless blueAt room temperature, the equilibrium mixture is blue due to [CoCl4]2–. When cooled in a freesing mixture, the colour of the mixture turns pink due to [Co(H2O)6]3+.6.8.5 Effect of a CatalystA catalyst increases the rate of the chemical reaction by making available a new low energy \npathway for the conversion of reactants to products. It increases the rate of forward \nand reverse reactions that pass through the \nsame transition state and does not affect \nequilibrium. Catalyst lowers the activation \nenergy for the forward and reverse reactions \nby exactly the same amount. Catalyst does \nnot affect the equilibrium composition of \na reaction mixture. It does not appear in \nthe balanced chemical equation or in the \nequilibrium constant expression.Let us consider the formation of NH3 from dinitrogen and dihydrogen which is \nhighly exothermic reaction and proceeds \nwith decrease in total number of moles \nformed as compared to the reactants. \nEquilibrium constant decreases with increase \nin temperature. At low temperature rate \ndecreases and it takes long time to reach at \nequilibrium, whereas high temperatures give satisfactory rates but poor yields. German chemist, Fritz Haber discovered that a catalyst consisting of iron catalyse the reaction to occur at a satisfactory rate \nat temperatures, where the equilibrium \nconcentration of NH3 is reasonably favourable. Since the number of moles formed in the \nreaction is less than those of reactants, the \nyield of NH3 can be improved by increasing the pressure.Optimum conditions of temperature and pressure for the synthesis of NH3 using catalyst are around 500°C and 200 atm.Similarly, in manufacture of sulphuric acid by contact process,2SO2(g) + O2(g)  2SO3(g);  Kc = 1.7 × 1026though the value of K is suggestive of reaction going to completion, but practically the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 is very slow. Thus, platinum or divanadium penta-oxide (V2O5) is used as catalyst to increase the rate of the \nreaction.Note: If a reaction has an exceedingly small K, a catalyst would be of little help.6.9 IONIC EQUILIBRIUM IN SOLUTIONUnder the effect of change of concentration on the direction of equilibrium, you have incidently come across with the following equilibrium which involves ions:Fe3+(aq) + SCN–(aq)  [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)There are numerous equilibria that involve ions only. In the following sections we will study the equilibria involving ions. It is well \nknown that the aqueous solution of sugar \ndoes not conduct electricity. However, when \ncommon salt (sodium chloride) is added \nto water it conducts electricity. Also, the \nconductance of electricity increases with an \nincrease in concentration of common salt. �Michael Faraday classified the substances \ninto two categories based on their ability \nto conduct electricity. One category of \nsubstances conduct electricity in their \naqueous solutions and are called electrolytes while the other do not and are thus, referred to \nas non-electrolytes. Faraday further classified electrolytes into strong and weak electrolytes. Strong electrolytes on dissolution in water \nare ionized almost completely, while the weak \nelectrolytes are only partially dissociated.  For example, an aqueous solution of  sodium chloride is comprised entirely of sodium ions and chloride ions, while that  of acetic acid mainly contains unionized  acetic acid molecules and only some acetate \nions and hydronium ions. This is because  there is almost 100% ionization in case \nof sodium chloride as compared to less  than 5% ionization of acetic acid which is  a weak electrolyte. It should be noted  Unit 6.indd   18811/2/2022   4:11:28 PM189Fig.6.10 Dissolution of sodium chloride in water. Na+ and Cl– ions are stablised by their hydration with polar water molecules.that in weak electrolytes, equilibrium is established between ions and the unionized \nmolecules. This type of equilibrium involving \nions in aqueous solution is called ionic \nequilibrium. Acids, bases and salts come \nunder the category of electrolytes and may act \nas either strong or weak electrolytes.6.10 ACIDS, BASES AND SALTSAcids, bases and salts find widespread occurrence in nature. Hydrochloric acid present in the gastric juice is secreted by the �lining of our stomach in a significant amount \nof 1.2-1.5 L/day and is essential for digestive \n processes. Acetic acid is known to be the main \nconstituent of vinegar. Lemon and orange \njuices contain citric and ascorbic acids, and \ntartaric acid is found in tamarind paste. As \nmost of the acids taste sour, the word “acid” \nhas been derived from a latin word “acidus” \nmeaning sour. Acids are known to turn blue \nlitmus paper into red and liberate dihydrogen \non reacting with some metals. Similarly, bases \nare known to turn red litmus paper blue, taste \nbitter and feel soapy. A common example \nof a base is washing soda used for washing \npurposes. When acids and bases are mixed \nin the right proportion they react with each \nother to give salts. Some commonly known \nexamples of salts are sodium chloride, barium \nsulphate, sodium nitrate.  Sodium chloride \n(common salt) is an important component of \nour diet and is formed by reaction between \nhydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. It exists in solid state as a cluster of positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged \nchloride ions which are held together due to \nelectrostatic interactions between oppositely \ncharged species (Fig.6.10). The electrostatic \nforces between two charges are inversely \nproportional to dielectric constant of the \nmedium. Water, a universal solvent, possesses \na very high dielectric constant of 80. Thus, \nwhen sodium chloride is dissolved in water, \nthe electrostatic interactions are reduced by \na factor of 80 and this facilitates the ions to \nmove freely in the solution. Also, they are \nwell-separated due to hydration with water \nmolecules. Faraday was born near London into a family of very limited means. At the age of 14 he was an apprentice to a kind bookbinder who allowed Faraday to read the \nbooks he was binding. Through a fortunate chance he became laboratory assistant \nto Davy, and during 1813-4, Faraday accompanied him to the Continent.  During \nthis trip he gained much from the experience of coming into contact with many of the \nleading scientists of the time.  In 1825, he succeeded Davy as Director of the Royal �Institution\tlaboratories,\tand\tin\t1833\the\talso\tbecame\tthe\tfirst\tFullerian\tProfessor\tof\tChemistry.\tFaraday’s\tfirst\timportant\twork\twas\ton\tanalytical\tchemistry.\tAfter\t1821\tmuch of his work was on electricity and magnetism and different electromagnetic �phenomena.\tHis\tideas\thave\tled\tto\tthe\testablishment\tof\tmodern\tfield\ttheory.\t\tHe discovered his two laws of electrolysis in 1834.

The extent to which \nionization occurs depends upon the strength \nof the bond and the extent of solvation \nof ions produced. The terms dissociation \nand ionization have earlier been used with \ndifferent meaning. Dissociation refers to the \nprocess of separation of ions in water already \nexisting as such in the solid state of the solute, \nas in sodium chloride. On the other hand, \nionization corresponds to a process in which \na neutral molecule splits into charged ions in \nthe solution. Here, we shall not distinguish \nbetween the two and use the two terms \ninterchangeably. 6.10.1 Arrhenius Concept of Acids and BasesAccording to Arrhenius theory, acids are substances that dissociates in water to give hydrogen ions H+(aq) and bases are substances that produce hydroxyl ions OH–(aq). The ionization of an acid HX (aq) can be represented by the following equations:HX (aq) → H+(aq) + X– (aq)orHX(aq) + H2O(l) → H3O+(aq) + X –(aq)A bare proton, H+ is very reactive and cannot exist freely in aqueous solutions. Thus, it bonds to the oxygen atom of a solvent \nwater molecule to give trigonal pyramidal hydronium ion, H3O+ {[H (H2O)]+} (see box). In this chapter we shall use H+(aq) and H3O+(aq) interchangeably to mean the same i.e., a \nhydrated proton. Similarly, a base molecule like MOH ionizes in aqueous solution according to the \nequation:MOH(aq) → M+(aq) + OH–(aq)The hydroxyl ion also exists in the hydrated \nform in the aqueous solution. Arrhenius \nconcept of acid and base, however, suffers \nfrom the limitation of being applicable only to \naqueous solutions and also, does not account \nfor the basicity of substances like, ammonia \nwhich do not possess a hydroxyl group.6.10.2 The Brönsted-Lowry Acids and BasesThe Danish chemist, Johannes Brönsted and the English chemist, Thomas M. Lowry gave �a more general definition of acids and bases. According to Brönsted-Lowry theory, acid is a substance that is capable of donating a \nhydrogen ion H+ and bases are substances capable of accepting a hydrogen ion, H+. In short, acids are proton donors and bases are \nproton acceptors. Consider the example of dissolution of NH3 in H2O represented by the following equation:Hydronium and Hydroxyl IonsHydrogen ion by itself is a bare proton with very small size (~10–15 m radius) and intense electric field, binds itself with the water molecule at \none of the two available lone pairs on it giving \nH3O+. This species has been detected in many compounds (e.g., H3O+Cl–) in the solid state. In aqueous solution the hydronium ion is further \nhydrated to give species like H5O2+, H7O3+ and H9O4+. Similarly the hydroxyl ion is hydrated to give several ionic species like H3O2–, H5O3– and H7O4– etc.The basic solution is formed due to the presence of hydroxyl ions. In this reaction, water molecule acts as proton donor and \nammonia molecule acts as proton acceptor \nand are thus, called Lowry-Brönsted acid and H9O4+Unit 6.indd   1909/12/2022   11:58:26 AM191Arrhenius was born near Uppsala, Sweden. He presented his thesis, on the conductivities of electrolyte solutions, to the University of Uppsala in 1884.  For the �next\tfive\tyears\the\ttravelled\textensively\tand\tvisited\ta\tnumber\tof\tresearch\tcenters\tin Europe. In 1895 he was appointed professor of physics at the newly formed \nUniversity of Stockholm, serving its rector from 1897 to 1902.  From 1905 until his death he was Director of physical chemistry at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm.  He \ncontinued to work for many years on electrolytic solutions.  In 1899 he discussed \nthe temperature dependence of reaction rates on the basis of an equation, now \nusually known as Arrhenius equation.He worked in a variety of fields, and made important contributions to immunochemistry, cosmology, the origin of life, and the causes of ice age. He was �the\tfirst\tto\tdiscuss\tthe\t‘green\thouse\teffect’\tcalling\tby\tthat\tname.\tHe\treceived\tNobel\tPrize in Chemistry in 1903 for his theory of electrolytic dissociation and its use in the development of chemistry.base, respectively. In the reverse reaction, H+ is transferred from NH4+ to OH–. In this case, NH4+ acts as a Bronsted acid while OH– acted as a Brönsted base. The acid-base pair that differs only by one proton is called \na conjugate acid-base pair. Therefore, OH– is called the conjugate base of an acid H2O and NH4+ is called conjugate acid of the base NH3. If Brönsted acid is a strong acid then its conjugate base is a weak base and vice-versa. It may be noted that conjugate acid has one extra proton and each conjugate base \nhas one less proton.Consider the example of ionization of hydrochloric acid in water. HCl(aq) acts as \nan acid by donating a proton to H2O molecule which acts as a base.in case of ammonia it acts as an acid by \ndonating a proton.Problem 6.12What will be the conjugate bases for the following Brönsted acids: HF, H2SO4 and HCO3– ?SolutionThe conjugate bases should have one proton less in each case and therefore the \ncorresponding conjugate bases are: F–, HSO4– and CO32– respectively.Problem 6.13Write the conjugate acids for the following Brönsted bases: NH2–, NH3 and HCOO–.SolutionThe conjugate acid should have one extra proton in each case and therefore the \ncorresponding conjugate acids are: NH3, NH4+ and HCOOH respectively.Problem 6.14The species: H2O, HCO3–, HSO4– and NH3 can act both as Bronsted acids and bases. For each case give the corresponding conjugate \nacid and conjugate base.SolutionThe answer is given in the following Table:Species     Conjugate      Conjugate           acid          baseH2O   H3O+  OH–HCO3–   H2CO3  CO32–HSO4–   H2SO4  SO42–NH3   NH4+  NH2–Svante Arrhenius(1859-1927)It can be seen in the above equation, that water acts as a base because it accepts the proton. The species H3O+ is produced when water accepts a proton from HCl. Therefore, \nCl– is a conjugate base of HCl and HCl is the conjugate acid of base Cl–. Similarly, H2O is a conjugate base of an acid H3O+ and H3O+ is a conjugate acid of base H2O.It is interesting to observe the dual role of water as an acid and a base. In case of \nreaction with HCl water acts as a base while Unit 6.indd   1919/12/2022   11:58:26 AM1926.10.3 Lewis Acids and BasesG.N. Lewis in 1923 defined an acid as a species which accepts electron pair and base which donates an electron pair. As far as bases \nare concerned, there is not much difference \nbetween Brönsted-Lowry and Lewis concepts, \nas the base provides a lone pair in both the \ncases. However, in Lewis concept many \nacids do not have proton. A typical example �is reaction of electron deficient species BF3 with NH3.BF3 does not have a proton but still acts as an acid and reacts with NH3 by accepting its lone pair of electrons. The reaction can be \nrepresented by,BF3 + :NH3 → BF3:NH3Electron deficient species  like AlCl3, Co3+, Mg2+, etc.  can act as Lewis acids while species like H2O, NH3, OH– etc. which can donate a pair of electrons, can act as Lewis bases.Problem 6.15Classify the following species into Lewis acids and Lewis bases and show how these \nact as such:(a) HO– (b) F–       (c) H+  (d) BCl3Solution (a) Hydroxyl ion is a Lewis base as it can donate an electron lone pair (:OH– ).(b) Flouride ion acts as a Lewis base \nas it can donate any one of its four \nelectron lone pairs.(c) A proton is a Lewis acid as it can accept a lone pair of electrons from �bases like hydroxyl ion and fluoride \nion.(d)  BCl3 acts as a Lewis acid as it can accept a lone pair of electrons from \nspecies like ammonia or amine \nmolecules.6.11 IONIZATION OF ACIDS AND BASESArrhenius concept of acids and bases becomes useful in case of ionization of acids \nand bases as mostly ionizations in chemical \nand biological systems occur in aqueous \nmedium. Strong acids like perchloric acid (HClO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hyrdoiodic acid (HI), nitric acid \n(HNO3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) are termed strong because they are almost completely \ndissociated into their constituent ions in an \naqueous medium, thereby acting as proton \n(H+) donors. Similarly, strong bases like lithium hydroxide (LiOH), sodium hydroxide \n(NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), caesium \nhydroxide (CsOH) and barium hydroxide \nBa(OH)2 are almost completely dissociated into ions in an aqueous medium giving \nhydroxyl ions, OH–. According to Arrhenius concept they are strong acids and bases as \nthey are able to completely dissociate and \nproduce H3O+ and OH– ions respectively in the medium. Alternatively, the strength of an \nacid or base may also be gauged in terms of \nBrönsted-Lowry concept of acids and bases, \nwherein a strong acid means a good proton \ndonor and a strong base implies a good proton \nacceptor. Consider, the acid-base dissociation \nequilibrium of a weak acid HA,HA(aq)  +  H2O(l)   H3O+(aq)  +  A–(aq)                                     conjugate    conjugateacid         base              acid            baseIn section 6.10.2 we saw that acid (or base) dissociation equilibrium is dynamic involving a transfer of proton in forward and reverse directions. Now, the question arises \nthat if the equilibrium is dynamic then with \npassage of time which direction is favoured? \nWhat is the driving force behind it? In order \nto answer these questions we shall deal \ninto the issue of comparing the strengths \nof the two acids (or bases) involved in the \ndissociation equilibrium. Consider the two \nacids HA and H3O+ present in the above mentioned acid-dissociation equilibrium. \nWe have to see which amongst them is a \nstronger proton donor. Whichever exceeds \nin its tendency of donating a proton over the \nother shall be termed as the stronger acid \nand the equilibrium will shift in the direction \nof weaker acid. Say, if HA is a stronger acid \nthan H3O+, then HA will donate protons and not H3O+, and the solution will mainly contain A– and H3O+ ions. The equilibrium moves in the direction of formation of weaker acid Unit 6.indd   1929/12/2022   11:58:26 AM193and weaker base because the stronger acid donates a proton to the stronger base. It follows that as a strong acid dissociates completely in water, the resulting base formed \nwould be very weak i.e., strong acids have \nvery weak conjugate bases. Strong acids \nlike perchloric acid (HClO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hydroiodic acid \n(HI), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) will give conjugate base ions ClO4–, Cl, Br–, I–, NO3– and HSO4– , which are much weaker bases than H2O. Similarly a very strong base would give a very weak conjugate acid. On the \nother hand, a weak acid say HA is only partially \ndissociated in aqueous medium and thus, the \nsolution mainly contains undissociated HA \nmolecules. Typical weak acids are nitrous \nacid (HNO2), hydrofluoric acid (HF) and acetic acid (CH3COOH). It should be noted that the weak acids have very strong conjugate bases. \nFor example, NH2–, O2– and H– are very good proton acceptors and thus, much stronger \nbases than H2O. Certain water soluble organic compounds like phenolphthalein and bromothymol blue \nbehave as weak acids and exhibit different \ncolours in their acid (HIn) and conjugate base \n(In– ) forms.HIn(aq)  +   H2O(l)     H3O+(aq)   +   In–(aq)  acid    conjugate  conjugateindicator        acid           basecolour A               colour BSuch compounds are useful as indicators in acid-base titrations, and finding out H+ ion concentration.6.11.1 The Ionization Constant of Water and its Ionic ProductSome substances like water are unique in their ability of acting both as an acid and a base. We have seen this in case of water in \nsection 6.10.2. In presence of an acid, HA it \naccepts a proton and acts as the base while \nin the presence of a base, B– it acts as an acid by donating a proton. In pure water, one \nH2O molecule donates proton and acts as an acid and another water molecules accepts a \nproton and acts as a base at the same time.  The following equilibrium exists:H2O(l)  +  H2O(l)     H3O+(aq)  +   OH–(aq)acid        base         conjugate       conjugate                          acid                baseThe dissociation constant is represented by,K = [H3O+] [OH–] / [H2O]                    (6.26)The concentration of water is omitted from the denominator as water is a pure liquid and its concentration remains constant. [H2O] is incorporated within the equilibrium constant to give a new constant, Kw, which is called the ionic product of water.  Kw = [H+][OH–]            (6.27)The concentration of H+ has been found out experimentally as 1.0 × 10–7 M at 298 K. And, as dissociation of water produces equal \nnumber of H+ and OH– ions, the concentration of hydroxyl ions, [OH–] = [H+] = 1.0 × 10–7 M.  Thus, the value of Kw at 298K,Kw = [H3O+][OH–] = (1 × 10–7)2 = 1 × 10–14 M2 (6.28)The value of Kw is temperature dependent as it is an equilibrium constant.The density of pure water is 1000 g / L and its molar mass is 18.0 g /mol. From this \nthe molarity of pure water can be given as,[H2O] = (1000 g /L)(1 mol/18.0 g) = 55.55 M. Therefore, the ratio of dissociated water to that of undissociated water can be given as:10–7 / (55.55) = 1.8 × 10–9 or  ~ 2 in 10–9 (thus, equilibrium lies mainly towards undissociated water)We can distinguish acidic, neutral and basic aqueous solutions by the relative values of the H3O+ and OH– concentrations:Acidic: [H3O+] \u003e [OH– ]Neutral: [H3O+] = [OH– ]Basic : [H3O+] \u003c [OH–]6.11.2 The pH ScaleHydronium ion concentration in molarity is more conveniently expressed on a logarithmic scale known as the pH scale. The pH of a �solution is defined as the negative logarithm to base 10 of the activity aH\u001f\u001e\u001d of hydrogen Unit 6.indd   1939/12/2022   11:58:26 AM194ion. In dilute solutions (\u003c 0.01 M), activity of hydrogen ion (H+) is equal in magnitude to molarity represented by [H+]. It should  be noted that activity has no units and is defined as:  = [H+] / mol L–1From the definition of pH, the following can be written,pH = – log aH+ = – log {[H+] / mol L–1}Thus, an acidic solution of HCl (10–2 M) will have a pH = 2. Similarly, a basic solution of NaOH having [OH–] =10–4 M and [H3O+] =  10–10 M will have a pH = 10. At 25 °C, pure water has a concentration of hydrogen ions,  [H+] = 10–7 M. Hence, the pH of pure water is given as:pH = –log(10–7) = 7Acidic solutions possess a concentration of hydrogen ions, [H+] \u003e 10–7 M, while basic solutions possess a concentration of hydrogen \nions, [H+] \u003c 10–7 M. thus, we can summarise that\nAcidic solution has pH \u003c 7Basic solution has pH \u003e 7\nNeutral solution has pH = 7Now again, consider the equation (6.28) at 298 KKw = [H3O+] [OH–] = 10–14Taking negative logarithm on both sides of equation, we obtain–log Kw = – log {[H3O+] [OH–]}              = – log [H3O+] – log [OH–]             = – log 10–14   pKw  =   pH  +  pOH   =   14             (6.29)Note that although Kw may change with temperature the variations in pH with temperature are so small that we often  ignore it.pKw is a very important quantity for aqueous solutions and controls the relative concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxyl \nions as their product is a constant. It should \nbe noted that as the pH scale is logarithmic, \na change in pH by just one unit also means \nchange in [H+] by a factor of 10. Similarly, when the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+] changes by a factor of 100, the value of pH \nchanges by 2 units. Now you can realise why \nthe change in pH with temperature is often \nignored.Measurement of pH of a solution is very essential as its value should be known \nwhen dealing with biological and cosmetic \napplications. The pH of a solution can be \nfound roughly with the help of pH paper that \nhas different colour in solutions of different \npH. Now-a-days pH paper is available with \nfour strips on it. The different strips have \ndifferent colours (Fig. 6.11) at the same pH. \nThe pH in the range of 1-14 can be determined \nwith an accuracy of ~0.5 using pH paper. Fig.6.11 pH-paper with four strips that may have different colours at the same pHFor greater accuracy pH meters are used. pH meter is a device that measures the  pH-dependent electrical potential of the test solution within 0.001 precision. pH meters \nof the size of a writing pen are now available \nin the market. The pH of some very common \nsubstances are given in Table 6.5 (page 195).Problem 6.16The concentration of hydrogen ion in a sample of soft drink is 3.8 × 10–3M. what is its pH ?SolutionpH = – log[3.8 × 10–3]       = – {log[3.8] + log[10–3]}      = – {(0.58) + (– 3.0)} = – { – 2.42} = 2.42Therefore, the pH of the soft drink is 2.42 \nand it can be inferred that it is acidic.Problem 6.17  Calculate pH of a 1.0 × 10–8 M solution of HCl.Unit 6.indd   1949/12/2022   11:58:28 AM195Table 6.6 The Ionization Constants of Some Selected Weak Acids (at 298K) Acid Ionization Constant,   KaHydrofluoric Acid (HF) 3.5 × 10–4Nitrous Acid (HNO2) 4.5 × 10–4Formic Acid (HCOOH) 1.8 × 10–4Niacin (C5H4NCOOH) 1.5 × 10–5Acetic Acid (CH3COOH) 1.74 × 10–5Benzoic Acid (C6H5COOH) 6.5 × 10–5Hypochlorous Acid (HCIO) 3.0 × 10–8Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN) 4.9 × 10–10Phenol (C6H5OH) 1.3 × 10–10Solution    2H2O (l)   H3O+ (aq)  +  OH–(aq) Kw = [OH–][H3O+]      = 10–14Let, x = [OH–] = [H3O+] from H2O.  The H3O+ concentration is generated (i) from  the ionization of HCl dissolved i.e., HCl(aq)  + H2O(l)  H3O+ (aq)  +  Cl –(aq),  and (ii) from ionization of H2O. In these very dilute solutions, both sources of H3O+ must be considered:\n[H3O+] = 10–8 + xKw = (10–8 + x)(x) = 10–14 or x2 + 10–8 x – 10–14 = 0[OH– ] = x = 9.5 × 10–8So, pOH = 7.02 and pH = 6.986.11.3 Ionization Constants of Weak AcidsConsider a weak acid HX that is partially ionized in the aqueous solution. The equilibrium can be expressed by:HX(aq) + H2O(l)  H3O+(aq) + X–(aq)Initial concentration (M)\nc                                0               0\nLet α be the extent of ionization�Change (M) -cα                 +cα               +cαEquilibrium concentration (M) c-cα                  cα                cα Here, c = initial concentration of the undissociated acid, HX at time, t = 0. α = extent up to which HX is ionized into ions. Using these notations, we can derive the equilibrium constant for the above discussed �acid-dissociation equilibrium:Ka = c2α2 / c(1-α) = cα2 / 1-αKa is called the dissociation or ionization constant of acid HX. It can be represented alternatively in terms of molar concentration �as follows,   Ka = [H+][X–] / [HX]         (6.30)At a given temperature T, Ka is a measure of the strength of the acid HX i.e., \nlarger the value of Ka, the stronger is the acid. Ka is a dimensionless quantity with the understanding that the standard state \nconcentration of all species is 1M.The values of the ionization constants of some selected weak acids are given in  Table 6.6.Table 6.5  The pH of Some Common Substances Name of the Fluid pH Name of the Fluid pHSaturated solution of NaOH ~15 Black Coffee 5.00.1 M NaOH solution 13 Tomato juice ~4.2Lime water 10.5 Soft drinks and vinegar ~3.0Milk of magnesia 10 Lemon juice ~2.2 Egg white, sea water 7.8 Gastric juice ~1.2Human blood 7.4 1M HCl solution ~0Milk  6.8 Concentrated HCl ~–1.0Human Saliva 6.4 The pH scale for the hydrogen ion concentration has been so useful that besides \npKw, it has been extended to other species and Unit 6.indd   19511/2/2022   4:11:08 PM196quantities. Thus, we have:pKa = –log (Ka)                                   (6.31)Knowing the ionization constant, Ka of an acid and its initial concentration, c, it is possible to calculate the equilibrium �concentration of all species and also the degree of ionization of the acid and the pH of the solution.A general step-wise approach can be adopted to evaluate the pH of the weak �electrolyte as follows:Step 1. The species present before dissociation are identified as Brönsted-Lowry  acids/bases.Step 2. Balanced equations for all possible reactions i.e., with a species acting both as acid as well as base are written.Step 3. The reaction with the higher Ka is identified as the primary reaction whilst the other is a subsidiary reaction.Step 4.  Enlist in a tabular form the following values for each of the species in the primary \nreaction(a) Initial concentration, c.(b) Change in concentration on proceeding to equilibrium in terms of α, degree of ionization.(c) Equilibrium concentration.Step 5. Substitute equilibrium concentrations into equilibrium constant equation for �principal reaction and solve for α.Step 6.  Calculate the concentration of species \nin principal reaction.Step 7.  Calculate pH = – log[H3O+]The above mentioned methodology has been elucidated in the following examples.Solution The following proton transfer reactions are possible:1) HF + H2O  H3O+ + F–                                            Ka = 3.2 × 10–42) H2O + H2O  H3O+ + OH–                                         Kw = 1.0 × 10–14As Ka \u003e\u003e Kw, [1] is the principle reaction.

Also, determine the value of Ka and pKa of the monobasic acid. Solution    pH = – log [H+]Therefore, [H+] = 10 –pH = 10–4.50                                      = 3.16 × 10–5 [H+] = [A–] = 3.16 × 10–5Thus,   Ka = [H+][A-] / [HA] [HA]eqlbm = 0.1 – (3.16 × 10-5)   0.1Ka = (3.16 × 10–5)2 / 0.1 = 1.0 × 10–8pKa = – log(10–8) = 8Alternatively, “Percent dissociation” is \nanother useful method for measure of \nstrength of a weak acid and is given as:Percent dissociation \n= [HA]dissociated/[HA]initial × 100%            (6.32)Problem 6.20Calculate the pH of 0.08M solution of hypochlorous acid, HOCl.

The equilibrium constant for base ionization \nis called base ionization constant and is \nrepresented by Kb. It can be expressed in terms of concentration in molarity of various \nspecies in equilibrium by the following \nequation:Kb = [M+][OH–] / [MOH]         (6.33)Alternatively, if c = initial concentration of base and α = degree of ionization of base i.e. the extent to which the base ionizes. When equilibrium is reached, the equilibrium \nconstant can be written as:Kb = (cα)2 / c (1-α) = cα2 / (1-α)The values of the ionization constants of some selected weak bases, Kb are given in  Table 6.7.Many organic compounds like amines are weak bases. Amines are derivatives of ammonia in which one or more hydrogen \natoms are replaced by another group. For \nexample, methylamine, codeine, quinine and Unit 6.indd   1979/12/2022   11:58:28 AM198nicotine all behave as very weak bases due to their very small Kb. Ammonia produces OH– in aqueous solution:NH3(aq) + H2O(l)   NH4+(aq) + OH–(aq)The pH scale for the hydrogen ion concentration has been extended to get:pKb = –log (Kb)             (6.34)Problem 6.21 The pH of 0.004M hydrazine solution is 9.7. Calculate its ionization constant Kb and pKb.Solution NH2NH2  +  H2O   NH2NH3+   +   OH–From the pH we can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration. Knowing hydrogen ion \nconcentration and the ionic product of water we can calculate the concentration of hydroxyl ions. Thus we have:[H+] = antilog (–pH) =  antilog (–9.7) = 1.67 ×10–10[OH–] = Kw / [H+] = 1 × 10–14 / 1.67 × 10–10                   = 5.98 × 10–5The concentration of the corresponding hydrazinium ion is also the same as that \nof hydroxyl ion. The concentration of both \nthese ions is very small so the concentration \nof the undissociated base can be taken \nequal to 0.004M.Thus,\nKb = [NH2NH3+][OH–] / [NH2NH2] = (5.98 × 10–5)2 / 0.004 = 8.96 × 10–7pKb = –logKb = –log(8.96 × 10–7) = 6.04.Problem 6.22Calculate the pH of the solution in which  0.2M NH4Cl and 0.1M NH3 are present. The pKb of ammonia solution is 4.75.Solution   NH3   +   H2O        NH4+     +      OH–The ionization constant of NH3,         Kb = antilog (–pKb) i.e.Kb = 10–4.75 = 1.77 × 10–5 M         NH3   +   H2O       NH4+     +      OH–Initial concentration (M)        0.10        0.20         0Change to reach \nequilibrium (M) \n           –x                          +x                  +x\nAt equilibrium (M)     \n      0.10 – x                 0.20 + x             x\nKb = [NH4+][OH–] / [NH3] = (0.20 + x)(x) / (0.1 – x) = 1.77 × 10–5As Kb is small, we can neglect x in comparison to 0.1M and 0.2M. Thus,\n[OH–] = x = 0.88 × 10–5Therefore, [H+] = 1.12 × 10–9pH = – log[H+] = 8.95.6.11.5 Relation between Ka and KbAs seen earlier in this chapter, Ka and Kb represent the strength of an acid and a base, respectively. In case of a conjugate acid-base \npair, they are related in a simple manner so \nthat if one is known, the other can be deduced. \nConsidering the example of NH4+ and NH3  we see,NH4+(aq) + H2O(l)   H3O+(aq) + NH3(aq)  Ka = [H3O+][ NH3] / [NH4+] = 5.6 × 10–10NH3(aq) + H2O(l)    NH4+(aq) + OH–(aq)     Kb =[ NH4+][ OH–] / NH3 = 1.8 × 10–5Net: 2 H2O(l)    H3O+(aq) + OH–(aq)            Kw = [H3O+][ OH– ] = 1.0 × 10–14 MWhere, Ka represents the strength of NH4+ as an acid and Kb represents the strength of NH3 as a base.It can be seen from the net reaction that the equilibrium constant is equal to the product of equilibrium constants Ka and Kb for the reactions added. Thus,Ka × Kb = {[H3O+][ NH3] / [NH4+ ]} × {[NH4+]                                         [OH–] / [NH3]}= [H3O+][OH–] = Kw= (5.6 ×10–10) × (1.8 × 10–5) = 1.0 × 10–14 MUnit 6.indd   1989/12/2022   11:58:28 AM199This can be extended to make a generalisation. The equilibrium constant for a net reaction obtained after adding two (or more) reactions equals the product \nof the equilibrium constants for individual \nreactions:KNET = K1 × K2 × ……                                   (6.35)Similarly, in case of a conjugate acid-base pair,Ka × Kb = Kw                                                             (6.36)Knowing one, the other can be obtained. It should be noted that a strong acid will have \na weak conjugate base and vice-versa.Alternatively, the above expression  Kw = Ka × Kb, can also be obtained by considering the base-dissociation equilibrium \nreaction:B(aq) + H2O(l)         BH+(aq) + OH–(aq)Kb = [BH+][OH–] / [B] As the concentration of water remains constant it has been omitted from the \ndenominator and incorporated within the \ndissociation constant. Then multiplying and \ndividing the above expression by [H+], we get:Kb = [BH+][OH–][H+] / [B][H+]      ={[ OH–][H+]}{[BH+] / [B][H+]}    = Kw / Kaor  Ka × Kb = KwIt may be noted that if we take negative logarithm of both sides of the equation, then pK values of the conjugate acid and base are \nrelated to each other by the equation:pKa + pKb = pKw = 14 (at 298K)Problem 6.23 Determine the degree of ionization and pH of a 0.05M of ammonia solution. The ionization \nconstant of ammonia can be taken from \nTable 6.7. Also, calculate the ionization \nconstant of the conjugate acid of ammonia.Solution The ionization of NH3 in water is represented by equation:NH3  +  H2O           NH4+    +    OH–We use equation (6.33) to calculate hydroxyl ion concentration,[OH–] = c α = 0.05 α Kb = 0.05 α2 / (1 – α)The value of α is small, therefore the quadratic equation can be simplified by neglecting α in comparison to 1 in the denominator on right hand side of the \nequation,Thus,\nKb = c α2  or   α = √ (1.77 × 10–5 / 0.05)                 = 0.018.[OH–] = c α = 0.05 × 0.018 = 9.4 × 10–4M.[H+] = Kw / [OH–] = 10–14 / (9.4 × 10–4)                           = 1.06 × 10–11pH = –log(1.06 × 10–11) = 10.97.Now, using the relation for conjugate acid-base pair,Ka × Kb = Kwusing the value of Kb of NH3 from  Table 6.7.\nWe can determine the concentration of conjugate acid NH4+Ka = Kw / Kb = 10–14 / 1.77 × 10–5                     = 5.64 × 10–10.6.11.6 Di- and Polybasic Acids and Di- and Polyacidic BasesSome of the acids like oxalic acid, sulphuric \nacid and phosphoric acids have more than \none ionizable proton per molecule of the acid. Such acids are known as polybasic or \npolyprotic acids.The ionization reactions for example for a dibasic acid H2X are represented by the equations:H2X(aq)  H+(aq) + HX–(aq)HX–(aq)  H+(aq) + X2–(aq)And the corresponding equilibrium constants are given below:Ka1= {[H+][HX–]} / [H2X] andUnit 6.indd   1999/12/2022   11:58:28 AM200Ka2 = {[H+][X2-]} / [HX-]Here, Ka1and Ka2are called the first and second ionization constants respectively of the acid H2 X. Similarly, for tribasic acids like H3PO4 we have three ionization constants. The values of the ionization constants for some common \npolyprotic acids are given in Table 6.8.In general, when strength of H-A bond decreases, that is, the energy required to break \nthe bond decreases, HA becomes a stronger \nacid. Also, when the H-A bond becomes more \npolar i.e., the electronegativity difference \nbetween the atoms H and A increases and \nthere is marked charge separation, cleavage \nof the bond becomes easier thereby increasing \nthe acidity.But it should be noted that while comparing elements in the same group of the periodic \ntable, H-A bond strength is a more important \nfactor in determining acidity than its polar \nnature. As the size of A increases down the \ngroup, H-A bond strength decreases and so \nthe acid strength increases. For example,Size increasesHF \u003c\u003c HCl \u003c\u003c HBr \u003c\u003c HIAcid strength increasesSimilarly, H2S is stronger acid than H2O.But, when we discuss elements in the same row of the periodic table, H-A bond polarity \nbecomes the deciding factor for determining \nthe acid strength. As the electronegativity \nof A increases, the strength of the acid also \nincreases. For example,Electronegativity of A increasesCH4 \u003c NH3 \u003c H2O \u003c HFAcid strength increases6.11.8 Common Ion Effect in the Ionization of Acids and BasesConsider an example of acetic acid dissociation \nequilibrium represented as:CH3COOH(aq)   H+(aq) +  CH3COO– (aq) or  HAc(aq)   H+ (aq) + Ac– (aq)Ka = [H+][Ac– ] / [HAc]Addition of acetate ions to an acetic acid solution results in decreasing the \nconcentration of hydrogen ions, [H+]. Also, if H+ ions are added from an external source then the equilibrium moves in the direction \nof undissociated acetic acid i.e., in a direction \nof reducing the concentration of hydrogen \nions, [H+]. This phenomenon is an example Table 6.8 The Ionization Constants of Some Common Polyprotic Acids (298K)It can be seen that higher order ionization constants (Ka2, Ka3) are smaller than the lower order ionization constant (Ka1) of a polyprotic acid. The reason for this is that it is more difficult to remove a positively \ncharged proton from a negative ion due to \nelectrostatic forces. This can be seen in the \ncase of removing a proton from the uncharged \nH2CO3 as compared from a negatively charged HCO3–. Similarly, it is more difficult to remove a proton from a doubly charged HPO42– anion as compared to H2PO4–. Polyprotic acid solutions contain a mixture of acids like H2A, HA– and A2– in case of a diprotic acid. H2A being a strong acid, the primary reaction involves the dissociation of \nH2 A, and H3O+ in the solution comes mainly from the first dissociation step.6.11.7 Factors Affecting Acid StrengthHaving discussed quantitatively the strengths of acids and bases, we come to a stage where we can calculate the pH of a given acid \nsolution. But, the curiosity rises about why \nshould some acids be stronger than others? \nWhat factors are responsible for making \nthem stronger? The answer lies in its being a \ncomplex phenomenon. But, broadly speaking \nwe can say that the extent of dissociation of \nan acid depends on the strength and polarity of the H-A bond.Unit 6.indd   2009/12/2022   11:58:28 AM201of common ion effect. It can be defined as a shift in equilibrium on adding a substance that provides more of an ionic species already \npresent in the dissociation equilibrium. \nThus, we can say that common ion effect is \na phenomenon based on the Le Chatelier’s \nprinciple discussed in section 6.8.In order to evaluate the pH of the solution resulting on addition of 0.05M acetate ion to \n0.05M acetic acid solution, we shall consider \nthe acetic acid dissociation equilibrium once \nagain, HAc(aq)  H+(aq)   +  Ac–(aq)Initial concentration (M)    0.05      0         0.05 Let x be the extent of ionization of acetic acid.Change in concentration (M)      –x       +x          +x\nEquilibrium concentration (M)\n 0.05-x      x      0.05+x\nTherefore, Ka= [H+][Ac– ]/[H Ac] = {(0.05+x)(x)}/(0.05-x)As Ka is small for a very weak acid, x\u003c\u003c0.05. Hence, (0.05 + x) ≈ (0.05 – x) ≈  0.05Thus, \n1.8 × 10–5 = (x) (0.05 + x) / (0.05 – x) = x(0.05) / (0.05) = x = [H+] = 1.8 × 10–5MpH = – log(1.8 × 10–5) = 4.74Problem 6.24 Calculate the pH of a 0.10M ammonia solution. Calculate the pH after 50.0 mL \nof this solution is treated with 25.0 mL of \n0.10M HCl. The dissociation constant of \nammonia, Kb = 1.77 × 10–5Solution  NH3     +      H2O      →     NH4+    +    OH– Kb = [NH4+][OH–] / [NH3] = 1.77 × 10–5Before neutralization,[NH4+] = [OH–] = x[NH3] = 0.10 – x   0.10x2 / 0.10 = 1.77 × 10–5Thus, x = 1.33 × 10–3 = [OH–]Therefore, [H+] = Kw / [OH–] = 10–14 /              (1.33 × 10–3) = 7.51 × 10–12pH = –log (7.5 × 10–12) = 11.12On addition of 25 mL of 0.1M HCl solution (i.e., 2.5 mmol of HCl) to 50 \nmL of 0.1M ammonia solution (i.e., 5 \nmmol of NH3), 2.5 mmol of ammonia molecules are neutralized. The resulting \n75 mL solution contains the remaining \nunneutralized 2.5 mmol of NH3 molecules and 2.5 mmol of NH4+.NH3    +    HCl    →    NH4+ +  Cl–2.5           2.5              0          0At equilibrium \n0              0             2.5         2.5\nThe resulting 75 mL of solution contains 2.5 mmol of NH4+ ions (i.e.,  0.033 M) and 2.5 mmol (i.e.,  0.033 M ) of uneutralised \nNH3 molecules. This NH3 exists in the following equilibrium:NH4OH      NH4+   +     OH–0.033M – y               y              y\nwhere, y  =  [OH–]  =  [NH4+]The final 75 mL solution after neutralisation already contains  2.5 m mol NH4+ ions (i.e. 0.033M), thus total concentration of NH4+ ions is given as:[NH4+] = 0.033 + yAs y is small, [NH4OH]  0.033 M and [NH4+]  0.033M.We know,\nKb = [NH4+][OH–] / [NH4OH]      = y (0.033)/(0.033) = 1.77 × 10–5 MThus, y = 1.77 × 10–5 = [OH–][H+] = 10–14 / 1.77 × 10–5 = 0.56 × 10–9Hence, pH = 9.246.11.9 Hydrolysis of Salts and the pH of their SolutionsSalts formed by the reactions between acids �and bases in definite proportions, undergo ionization in water. The cations/anions Unit 6.indd   2019/12/2022   11:58:29 AM202formed on ionization of salts either exist as hydrated ions in aqueous solutions or interact \nwith water to reform corresponding acids/\nbases depending upon the nature of salts. \nThe later process of interaction between \nwater and cations/anions or both of salts \nis called hydrolysis. The pH of the solution \ngets affected by this interaction. The cations \n(e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+, Ba2+, etc.) of strong bases and anions (e.g., Cl–, Br–, NO3–, ClO4– etc.) of strong acids simply get hydrated but do not \nhydrolyse, and therefore the solutions of \nsalts formed from strong acids and bases are \nneutral i.e., their pH is 7. However, the other \ncategory of salts do undergo hydrolysis.We now consider the hydrolysis of the salts of the following types :(i) salts of weak acid and strong base e.g., CH3COONa.(ii) salts of strong acid and weak base e.g., \nNH4Cl, and(iii) salts of weak acid and weak base, e.g., \nCH3COONH4.In the first case, CH3COONa being a salt of weak acid, CH3COOH and strong base, NaOH gets completely ionised in aqueous solution.CH3COONa(aq)   →  CH3COO– (aq)+  Na+(aq)Acetate ion thus formed undergoes hydrolysis in water to give acetic acid and OH– ionsCH3COO–(aq)+H2O(l)CH3COOH(aq)+OH–(aq)Acetic acid being a weak acid  (Ka = 1.8 × 10–5) remains mainly unionised in solution. This results in increase of OH– ion concentration in solution making it alkaline. \nThe pH of such a solution is more than 7.Similarly, NH4Cl formed from weak base, NH4OH and strong acid, HCl, in water dissociates completely.NH4Cl(aq) → NH+4(aq)  +Cl– (aq)Ammonium ions undergo hydrolysis with water to form NH4OH and H+ ionsNH+4 (aq) + H2O (1)  NH4OH(aq) + H+(aq) Ammonium hydroxide is a weak base  (Kb = 1.77 × 10–5) and therefore remains almost unionised in solution. This results in increased of H+ ion concentration in solution making the solution acidic. Thus, the pH of NH4Cl solution in water is less than 7.Consider the hydrolysis of CH3COONH4 salt formed from weak acid and weak base. \nThe ions formed undergo hydrolysis as follow:CH3COO– + NH4+ +  H2O   CH3COOH +                                                                         NH4OHCH3COOH and NH4OH, also remain into partially dissociated form:CH3COOH         CH3COO–  +  H+NH4OH           NH4+    +   OH–H2O          H+  +  OH–Without going into detailed calculation, it can be said that degree of hydrolysis is independent of concentration of solution, and pH of such solutions is determined by their \npK values:  pH = 7 + ½ (pKa – pKb)                             (6.38)The pH of solution can be greater than 7, if the difference is positive and it will be less \nthan 7, if the difference is negative.Problem 6.25The pKa of acetic acid and pKb of ammonium hydroxide are 4.76 and 4.75 respectively. Calculate the pH of ammonium acetate \nsolution.SolutionpH = 7 + ½ [pKa – pKb]       = 7 + ½ [4.76 – 4.75]       = 7 + ½ [0.01]  = 7 + 0.005  = 7.0056.12 BUFFER SOLUTIONSMany body fluids e.g., blood or urine have definite pH and any deviation in their pH indicates malfunctioning of the body. The \ncontrol of pH is also very important in \nmany chemical and biochemical processes. \nMany medical and cosmetic formulations \nrequire that these be kept and administered \nat a particular pH. The solutions which resist change in pH on dilution or with the addition of small amounts of acid or \nalkali are called Buffer Solutions. Buffer Unit 6.indd   2029/12/2022   11:58:29 AM203solutions of known pH can be prepared from the knowledge of pKa of the acid or pKb of base and by controlling the ratio of the salt and acid \nor salt and base. A mixture of acetic acid and \nsodium acetate acts as buffer solution around \npH 4.75 and a mixture of ammonium chloride \nand ammonium hydroxide acts as a buffer \naround pH 9.25. You will learn more about buffer solutions in higher classes.6.12.1 Designing Buffer Solution Knowledge of pKa, pKb and equilibrium constant help us to prepare the buffer solution of known pH. Let us see how we can do this.Preparation of Acidic Buffer To prepare a buffer of  acidic pH we use weak acid and its salt formed with strong base. We develop the equation relating the pH, the \nequilibrium constant, Ka  of weak acid and ratio of concentration of weak acid and its \nconjugate base. For the general case where the weak acid HA ionises in water, HA + H2O  H3O+ + A–For which we can write the expressionRearranging the expression we have,Taking logarithm on both the sides and rearranging the terms we get —              Or                    (6.39)    (6.40) The expression (6.40) is known as Henderson–Hasselbalch equation. The quantity  is the ratio of concentration of conjugate base (anion) of the acid and the acid present in the mixture. Since acid is a weak acid, it ionises to a very little extent and \nconcentration of [HA] is negligibly different \nfrom concentration of acid taken to form \nbuffer. Also, most of the conjugate base, [A—], comes from the ionisation of salt of the acid. \nTherefore, the concentration of conjugate \nbase will be negligibly different from the \nconcentration of salt. Thus, equation (6.40) \ntakes the form: ppKaH=[Salt][Acid]+logIn the equation (6.39), if the concentration of [A—] is equal to the concentration of [HA], then pH = pKa because value of log 1 is zero. Thus if we take molar concentration of acid and salt (conjugate base) same, the pH of the \nbuffer solution will be equal to the pKa of the acid. So for preparing the buffer solution of \nthe required pH we select that acid whose pKa is close to the required pH. For acetic acid \npKa value is 4.76, therefore pH of the buffer solution formed by acetic acid and sodium \nacetate taken in equal molar concentration \nwill be around 4.76.A similar analysis of a buffer made with a weak base and its conjugate acid leads to the result,      pOH=p+log[Conjugateacid,BH+]  [Base,B]bK  (6.41) pH of the buffer solution can be calculated by using the equation pH + pOH =14.We know that pH + pOH = pKw  and  pKa + pKb = pKw. On putting these values in equation (6.41) it takes the form as follows: p- pH=pp[Conjugateacid,BH]  [Base,B]wwKKKa\u001f\u001e\u001elog                           or       pH=p[Conjugateacid,BH]  [Base,B]Ka++log    (6.42)If molar concentration of base and its conjugate acid (cation) is same then pH of the buffer solution will be same as pKa for the base. pKa value for ammonia is s9.25; therefore a buffer of pH close to 9.25 can be obtained \nby taking ammonia solution and ammonium Unit 6.indd   2039/12/2022   11:58:29 AM204chloride solution of same molar concentration. For a buffer solution formed by ammonium \nchloride and ammonium hydroxide, equation  (6.42) becomes:  pH=[Conjugateacid,BH]  [Base,B]925.log++                 pH of the buffer solution is not affected by dilution because ratio under the logarithmic term remains unchanged. 6.13 SOLUBILITY EQUILIBRIA OF SPARINGLY SOLUBLE SALTSWe have already known that the solubility of ionic solids in water varies a great deal. Some of \nthese (like calcium chloride) are so soluble that they are hygroscopic in nature and even absorb \nwater vapour from atmosphere. Others (such �as lithium fluoride) have so little solubility \nthat they are commonly termed as insoluble. \nThe solubility depends on a number of factors \nimportant amongst which are the lattice \nenthalpy of the salt and the solvation enthalpy \nof the ions in a solution. For a salt to dissolve \nin a solvent the strong forces of attraction \nbetween its ions (lattice enthalpy) must be \novercome by the ion-solvent interactions. The \nsolvation enthalpy of ions is referred to in \nterms of solvation which is always negative i.e. \nenergy is released in the process of solvation. \nThe amount of solvation enthalpy depends on \nthe nature of the solvent. In case of a non-\npolar (covalent) solvent, solvation enthalpy is �small and hence, not sufficient to overcome \nlattice enthalpy of the salt. Consequently, the \nsalt does not dissolve in non-polar solvent. As \na general rule, for a salt to be able to dissolve \nin a particular solvent its solvation enthalpy \nmust be greater than its lattice enthalpy so \nthat the latter may be overcome by former. \nEach salt has its characteristic solubility which \ndepends on temperature. We classify salts on \nthe basis of their solubility in the following \nthree categories. Category I     Soluble    Solubility \u003e 0.1M Category II    Slightly    0.01M\u003cSolubility\u003c 0.1M                      Soluble  Category III   Sparingly  Solubility \u003c 0.01M\n                      SolubleWe shall now consider the equilibrium between the sparingly soluble ionic salt and its saturated aqueous solution.6.13.1 Solubility Product ConstantLet us now have a solid like barium sulphate in contact with its saturated aqueous solution. The equilibrium between the undisolved solid \nand the ions in a saturated solution can be  \nrepresented by the equation:BaSO4(s)   Ba2+(aq) + SO42–(aq),The equilibrium constant is given by the equation:K = {[Ba2+][SO42–]} / [BaSO4]For a pure solid substance the concentration remains constant and we can writeKsp = K[BaSO4] = [Ba2+][SO42–]           (6.43)We call Ksp the solubility product constant or simply solubility product. The experimental \nvalue of Ksp in above equation at 298K is  1.1 × 10–10. This means that for solid barium sulphate in equilibrium with its saturated \nsolution, the product of the concentrations \nof barium and sulphate ions is equal \nto its solubility product constant. The \nconcentrations of the two ions will be equal to \nthe molar solubility of the barium sulphate. \nIf molar solubility is S, then 1.1 × 10–10 = (S)(S) = S2 or                       S = 1.05 × 10–5.Thus, molar solubility of barium sulphate will be equal to 1.05 × 10–5 mol L–1.A salt may give on dissociation two or more than two anions and cations carrying different charges. For example, consider a salt \nlike zirconium phosphate of molecular formula (Zr4+)3(PO43–)4. It dissociates into 3 zirconium cations of charge +4 and 4 phosphate \nanions of charge –3. If the molar solubility of \nzirconium phosphate is S, then it can be seen \nfrom the stoichiometry of the compound that[Zr4+] = 3S and [PO43–] = 4S and Ksp = (3S)3 (4S)4 = 6912 (S)7or S = {Ksp / (33 × 44)}1/7 = (Ksp / 6912)1/7Unit 6.indd   2049/12/2022   11:58:30 AM205A solid salt of the general formula MXxpyq\u001f\u001ewith molar solubility S in equilibrium with its saturated solution may be represented by \nthe equation:MxXy(s)          xMp+(aq) + yXq (aq)(where x × p+ = y × q)And its solubility product constant is given by:Ksp   = [Mp+]x[Xq– ]y = (xS)x(yS)y      (6.44)        = xx . yy . S(x + y)     S(x + y) = Ksp / xx . yyS = (Ksp / xx . yy)1 / x + y                                             (6.45)The term Ksp in equation is given by Qsp (section 6.6.2) when the concentration of one or more species is not the concentration under \nequilibrium. Obviously under equilibrium \nconditions Ksp = Qsp but otherwise it gives the direction of the processes of precipitation or \ndissolution. The solubility product constants \nof a number of common salts at 298K are given in Table 6.9.Table 6.9 The Solubility Product Constants, Ksp of Some Common Ionic Salts at 298K.Problem 6.26Calculate the solubility of A2X3 in pure water, assuming that neither kind of ion reacts with water. The solubility product of \nA2X3, Ksp = 1.1 × 10–23.SolutionA2X3 → 2A3+ + 3X2–Ksp = [A3+]2 [X2–]3 = 1.1 × 10–23If  S = solubility of A2X3, then[A3+] = 2S;  [X2–] = 3Stherefore, Ksp = (2S)2(3S)3 = 108S5                                         = 1.1 × 10–23thus, S5 = 1 × 10–25S = 1.0 × 10–5 mol/L.Problem 6.27The values of Ksp of two sparingly soluble salts Ni(OH)2 and AgCN are 2.0 × 10–15 and 6 × 0–17 respectively. Which salt is more soluble? Explain.SolutionAgCN    Ag+ + CN–Unit 6.indd   2059/12/2022   11:58:30 AM206Ksp =  [Ag+][CN–] = 6 × 10–17Ni(OH)2      Ni2+ + 2OH–Ksp = [Ni2+][OH–]2 = 2 × 10–15Let [Ag+] = S1, then [CN-] = S1Let [Ni2+] = S2, then [OH–] = 2S2S12 = 6 × 10–17 , S1 = 7.8 × 10–9(S2)(2S2)2 = 2 × 10–15, S2 = 0.58 × 10–4Ni(OH)2 is more soluble than AgCN.6.13.2 Common Ion Effect on Solubility of Ionic SaltsIt is expected from Le Chatelier’s principle that if we increase the concentration of any one of the ions, it should combine with the \nion of its opposite charge and some of the \nsalt will be precipitated till once again Ksp = Qsp. Similarly, if the concentration of one of the ions is decreased, more salt will dissolve \nto increase the concentration of both the ions \ntill once again Ksp = Qsp. This is applicable even to soluble salts like sodium chloride \nexcept that due to higher concentrations \nof the ions, we use their activities instead \nof their molarities in the expression for \nQsp. Thus if we take a saturated solution of sodium chloride and pass HCl gas through it, \nthen sodium chloride is precipitated due to \nincreased concentration (activity) of chloride \nion available from the dissociation of HCl. \nSodium chloride thus obtained is of very \nhigh purity and we can get rid of impurities \nlike sodium and magnesium sulphates. The \ncommon ion effect is also used for almost \ncomplete precipitation of a particular ion \nas its sparingly soluble salt, with very low \nvalue of solubility product for gravimetric \nestimation. Thus we can precipitate silver ion \nas silver chloride, ferric ion as its hydroxide \n(or hydrated ferric oxide) and barium ion as \nits sulphate for quantitative estimations.Dissolution of S mol/L of Ni(OH)2 provides S mol/L of Ni2+ and 2S mol/L of OH–, but the total concentration of OH– = (0.10 + 2S) mol/L because the solution already contains 0.10 mol/L of OH– from NaOH.Ksp = 2.0 × 10–15 = [Ni2+] [OH–]2                          = (S) (0.10 + 2S)2As Ksp is small, 2S \u003c\u003c 0.10, thus, (0.10 + 2S) ≈ 0.10Hence,\n2.0 × 10–15 = S (0.10)2S = 2.0 × 10–13 M = [Ni2+]Problem 6.28Calculate the molar solubility of Ni(OH)2 in 0.10 M NaOH. The ionic product of Ni(OH)2 is 2.0 × 10–15.Solution\nLet the solubility of Ni(OH)2 be equal to S. The solubility of salts of weak acids like phosphates increases at lower pH. This is because at lower pH the concentration of the \nanion decreases due to its protonation. This \nin turn increase the solubility of the salt so \nthat Ksp = Qsp. We have to satisfy two equilibria simultaneously i.e.,Ksp = [M+] [X–],                           [X–] / [HX] = Ka/[H+] Taking inverse of both side and adding 1 we getHXXHHXHXHaaa\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\n\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001d\n\u001c\u001b\n\u001a\u0019\u001f\u001e\u0019\u001d\n\u001c\u001b\n\u001a\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0018\u001d\n\u001c\u001b\n\u001a\u0019\u0017\u0019\u0017\u0017\u001911KKKNow, again taking inverse, we get[X–] / {[X–] + [HX]} = f = Ka/(Ka + [H+]) and it can be seen that ‘f’ decreases as pH decreases. If S is the solubility of the salt at a given  pH then Ksp = [S] [f S] = S2 {Ka/(Ka + [H+])} andS = {Ksp ([H+] + Ka)/Ka}1/2    (6.46)Thus solubility S increases with increase in [H+] or decrease in pH. Unit 6.indd   2069/12/2022   11:58:30 AM207SUMMARYWhen the number of molecules leaving the liquid to vapour equals the number of molecules returning to the liquid from vapour, equilibrium is said to be attained and is dynamic in \nnature. Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical processes and at \nthis stage rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Equilibrium constant, Kc is expressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants, each term raised to the �stoichiometric coefficient.For reaction, a A + b B        c C +d DKc = [C]c[D]d/[A]a[B]bEquilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage all the macroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. become constant. For a gaseous \nreaction equilibrium constant is expressed as Kp and is written by replacing concentration terms by partial pressures in Kc expression. The direction of reaction can be predicted by reaction quotient Qc which is equal to Kc at equilibrium. Le Chatelier’s principle states that the change in any factor such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc. will cause the \nequilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce or counteract the effect of the change. It can be used to study the effect of various factors such as temperature, concentration, \npressure, catalyst and inert gases on the direction of equilibrium and to control the yield of \nproducts by controlling these factors. Catalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition \nof a reaction mixture but increases the rate of chemical reaction by making available a new \nlower energy pathway for conversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.All substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes. Acids, bases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous solutions \nis due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of electrolytes in aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In weak electrolytes \nthere is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte molecules. According to \nArrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous \nsolutions. Brönsted-Lowry on the other hand, defined an acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor. When a Brönsted-Lowry acid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate \nbase and a conjugate acid corresponding to the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate \npair of acid-base differs only by one proton. Lewis further generalised the definition of an acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions \nfor ionization (equilibrium) constants of weak acids (Ka) and weak bases (Kb) are developed using Arrhenius definition. The degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and \ncommon ion are discussed. The pH scale (pH = –log[H+]) for the hydrogen ion concentration (activity) has been introduced and extended to other quantities (pOH = – log[OH–]); pKa = –log[Ka];  pKb = –log[Kb]; and pKw = –log[Kw] etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and we note that the equation: pH + pOH = pKw is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid and weak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo hydrolysis in �aqueous solution. The definition of buffer solutions,  and their importance are discussed briefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed and the equilibrium \nconstant is introduced as solubility product constant (Ksp).

    "input": "295UNIT 9After studying this unit, you will be able to • name hydrocarbons according to IUPAC system of nomenclature; • recognise and write structures  of isomers of alkanes, alkenes, alkynes and aromatic \nhydrocarbons;• learn about various methods of \npreparation of hydrocarbons;• distinguish between alkanes, \nalkenes, alkynes and aromatic \nhydrocarbons on the basis of physical and chemical properties;• draw and differentiate between \nvarious conformations of ethane;• appreciate the role of hydrocarbons as sources of  energy and for other industrial \napplications;• predict the formation of the addition products of \nunsymmetrical alkenes and \nalkynes on the basis of electronic \nmechanism;• comprehend the structure of benzene, explain aromaticity  and understand mechanism  of electrophilic substitution \nreactions of benzene; • predict the directive influence of substituents in monosubstituted \nbenzene ring;• learn about carcinogenicity and \ntoxicity.HYDROCARBONSThe term ‘hydrocarbon’ is self-explanatory which means compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons \nplay a key role in our daily life. You must be familiar \nwith the terms ‘LPG’ and ‘CNG’ used as fuels. LPG is the \nabbreviated form of liquified petroleum gas whereas CNG \nstands for compressed natural gas. Another term ‘LNG’ \n(liquified natural gas) is also in news these days. This is \nalso a fuel and is obtained by liquifaction of natural gas. \nPetrol, diesel and kerosene oil are obtained by the fractional \ndistillation of petroleum found under the earth’s crust.  Coal gas is obtained by the destructive distillation of \ncoal. Natural gas is found in upper strata during drilling \nof oil wells. The gas after compression is known as \ncompressed natural gas. LPG is used as a domestic fuel \nwith the least pollution. Kerosene oil is also used as a \ndomestic fuel but it causes some pollution. Automobiles \nneed fuels like petrol, diesel and CNG. Petrol and CNG \noperated automobiles cause less pollution. All these fuels \ncontain mixture of hydrocarbons, which are sources of \nenergy. Hydrocarbons are also used for the manufacture of polymers like polythene, polypropene, polystyrene etc. \nHigher hydrocarbons are used as solvents for paints. They \nare also used as the starting materials for manufacture \nof many dyes and drugs. Thus, you can well understand \nthe importance of hydrocarbons in your daily life. In this \nunit, you will learn more about hydrocarbons.9.1 CLASSIFICATIONHydrocarbons are of different types. Depending upon the types of carbon-carbon bonds present, they can be classified into three main categories – (i) saturated  Hydrocarbons are the important sources of energy.Unit 9.indd   29510/10/2022   10:37:52 AM296(ii) unsaturated and (iii) aromatic hydrocarbons. Saturated hydrocarbons \ncontain carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen \nsingle bonds. If different carbon atoms are \njoined together to form open chain of carbon \natoms with single bonds, they are termed \nas alkanes as you have already studied in  Unit 8. On the other hand, if carbon atoms \nform a closed chain or a ring, they are termed \nas cycloalkanes. Unsaturated hydrocarbons �contain carbon-carbon multiple bonds – \ndouble bonds, triple bonds or both. Aromatic \nhydrocarbons are a special type of cyclic \ncompounds. You can construct a large \nnumber of models of such molecules of both \ntypes (open chain and close chain) keeping \nin mind that carbon is tetravalent and \nhydrogen is monovalent. For making models \nof alkanes, you can use toothpicks for bonds \nand plasticine balls for atoms. For alkenes, \nalkynes and aromatic hydrocarbons, spring \nmodels can be constructed.9.2  ALKANES As already mentioned, alkanes are saturated open chain hydrocarbons containing  carbon - carbon single bonds. Methane (CH4) is the first member of this family. Methane is \na gas found in coal mines and marshy places. \nIf you replace one hydrogen atom of methane \nby carbon and join the required number of \nhydrogens to satisfy the tetravalence of the \nother carbon atom, what do you get? You \nget C2H6. This hydrocarbon with molecular formula C2H6 is known as ethane. Thus you can consider C2H6 as derived from CH4 by replacing one hydrogen atom by -CH3 group. Go on constructing alkanes by doing this \ntheoretical exercise i.e., replacing hydrogen �atom by –CH3 group. The next molecules will be C3H8, C4H10 … of the general formula for alkane family \nor homologous series? If we examine the formula of different alkanes we find that \nthe general formula for alkanes is CnH2n+2. It represents any particular homologue when n \nis given appropriate value. Can you recall the \nstructure of methane? According to VSEPR \ntheory (Unit 4), methane has a tetrahedral \nstructure (Fig. 9.1), in which carbon atom lies \nat the centre and the four hydrogen atoms lie \nat the four corners of a regular tetrahedron.  �All H-C-H  bond angles are of 109.5°. In alkanes, tetrahedra are joined together in which C-C and C-H bond lengths are  154 pm and 112 pm respectively (Unit 8). �You have already read that C–C and C–H σ bonds are formed by head-on overlapping of \nsp3 hybrid orbitals of carbon and 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms.9.2.1 Nomenclature and Isomerism You have already read about nomenclature of different classes of organic compounds in Unit 8. Nomenclature and isomerism \nin alkanes can further be understood with \nthe help of a few more examples. Common \nnames are given in parenthesis. First three �alkanes – methane, ethane and propane have \nonly one structure but higher alkanes can \nhave more than one structure. Let us write \nstructures for C4H10. Four carbon atoms of C4H10 can be joined either in a continuous chain or with a branched chain in the \nfollowing two ways :Fig. 9.1  Structure of methane   Butane (n- butane), (b.p. 273 K)I H H H     H—C—H replace any H by - CH3 H—C—C—H or C2H6    H H H  These hydrocarbons are inert under normal conditions as they do not react with acids, bases and other reagents. Hence, \nthey were earlier known as paraffins (latin : \nparum, little; affinis, affinity). Can you think Unit 9.indd   29611/10/2022   15:24:01297 In how many ways, you can join five carbon atoms and twelve hydrogen atoms of C5H12? They can be arranged in three ways as shown in structures III–Visomers. It is also clear that structures I and III have continuous chain of carbon atoms \nbut structures II, IV and V have a branched \nchain. Such structural isomers which differ \nin chain of carbon atoms are known as chain isomers. Thus, you have seen that C4H10 and C5H12 have two and three chain isomers respectively.Problem 9.1Write structures of different chain isomers of alkanes corresponding to the \nmolecular formula C6H14. Also write their IUPAC names.Solution(i) CH3 – CH2 – CH2 – CH2– CH2– CH3n-Hexane2-Methylpentane3-Methylpentane2,3-Dimethylbutane 2,2 - Dimethylbutane Based upon the number of carbon atoms attached to a carbon atom, the carbon atom is termed as primary (1°), secondary (2°), tertiary (3°) or quaternary (4°). Carbon atom attached \nto no other carbon atom as in methane or to \nonly one carbon atom as in ethane is called \nprimary carbon atom. Terminal carbon \natoms are always primary. Carbon atom \nattached to two carbon atoms is known as \nsecondary. Tertiary carbon is attached to \nthree carbon atoms and neo or quaternary \ncarbon is attached to four carbon atoms. Can �you identify 1°, 2°, 3° and 4° carbon atoms in II2-Methylpropane (isobutane)  (b.p.261 K)Structures I and II possess same molecular formula but differ in their boiling points and other properties. Similarly structures III, IV and V possess the same molecular formula \nbut have different properties. Structures I and \nII are isomers of butane, whereas structures \nIII, IV and V are isomers of pentane. Since \ndifference in properties is due to difference in \ntheir structures, they are known as structural IIIPentane (n-pentane)(b.p. 309 K) 2-Methylbutane (isopentane) (b.p. 301 K)IV2,2-Dimethylpropane (neopentane) (b.p. 282.5 K)VUnit 9.indd   29710/10/2022   10:37:53 AM298structures I to V ? If you go on constructing structures for higher alkanes, you will be \ngetting still larger number of isomers. C6H14 has got five isomers and C7H16 has nine. As many as 75 isomers are possible for C10H22. In structures II, IV and V, you observed that –CH3 group is attached to carbon atom numbered as 2. You will come across groups �like –CH3, –C2H5, –C3H7 etc. attached to carbon atoms in alkanes or other classes of compounds.  These groups or substituents are known as alkyl groups as they are derived \nfrom alkanes by removal of one hydrogen \natom. General formula for alkyl groups is \nCnH2n+1 (Unit 8).  Let us recall the general rules for nomenclature already discussed in Unit 8. Nomenclature of substituted alkanes can \nfurther be understood by considering the \nfollowing problem:Problem 9.2Write structures of different isomeric alkyl groups corresponding to the molecular formula C5H11.

From unsaturated hydrocarbonsDihydrogen gas adds to alkenes and alkynes \nin the presence of finely divided catalysts like \nplatinum, palladium or nickel to form alkanes. \nThis process is called hydrogenation. These metals adsorb dihydrogen gas on their �surfaces and activate the hydrogen – hydrogen \nbond. Platinum and palladium catalyse the \nreaction at room temperature but relatively \nhigher temperature and pressure are required \nwith nickel catalysts.CH2 =CH2 + H2 Pt/Pd/Ni CH3−CH3 Ethene Propane   (9.1)  CH2–CH=CH2 + H2 Pt/Pd/Ni CH3−CH2CH3 Propane Propane(9.2) \nCH3–C≡ C–H + 2H Pt/Pd/Ni CH3−CH2CH3 Propyne Propane(9.3)2.

Why?9.2.3 PropertiesPhysical propertiesAlkanes are almost non-polar molecules because of the covalent nature of C-C and C-H bonds and due to very little difference \nof electronegativity between carbon and \nhydrogen atoms. They possess weak van der \nWaals forces. Due to the weak forces, the first \nfour members, C1 to C4 are gases, C5 to C17 are liquids and those containing 18 carbon \natoms or more are solids at 298 K. They are \ncolourless and odourless. What do you think \nabout solubility of alkanes in water based \nupon non-polar nature of alkanes? Petrol \nis a mixture of hydrocarbons and is used \nas a fuel for automobiles. Petrol and lower \nfractions of petroleum are also used for  dry \ncleaning of clothes to remove grease stains. \nOn the basis of this observation, what do \nyou think about the nature of the greasy \nsubstance? You are correct if you say that grease (mixture of higher alkanes) is non-Unit 9.indd   30103-05-2024   17:16:25302polar and, hence, hydrophobic  in nature. It is generally observed that in relation to solubility \nof substances in solvents, polar substances \nare soluble in polar solvents, whereas the \nnon-polar ones in non-polar solvents i.e., like dissolves like. Boiling point (b.p.) of different alkanes are given in Table 9.2 from which it is clear that \nthere is a steady increase in boiling point with \nincrease in molecular mass. This is due to the \nfact that the intermolecular van der Waals \nforces increase with increase of the molecular \nsize or the surface area of the molecule.  You can make an interesting observation by having a look on the boiling points of  three isomeric pentanes viz., (pentane,  2-methylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpropane). It \nis observed (Table 9.2) that pentane having \na continuous chain of five carbon atoms has \nthe highest boiling point (309.1K) whereas  2,2 – dimethylpropane boils at 282.5K. With \nincrease in number of branched chains, \nthe molecule attains the shape of a sphere. \nThis results in smaller area of contact and \ntherefore weak intermolecular forces between \nspherical molecules, which are overcome at \nrelatively lower temperatures. Chemical propertiesAs already mentioned, alkanes are generally \ninert towards acids, bases, oxidising and reducing agents. However, they undergo \nthe following reactions under certain  conditions.1. Substitution reactionsOne or more hydrogen atoms of alkanes can be replaced by halogens, nitro group \nand sulphonic acid group. Halogenation takes place either at higher temperature  (573-773 K) or in the presence of diffused \nsunlight or ultraviolet light. Lower alkanes \ndo not undergo nitration and sulphonation \nreactions. These reactions in which hydrogen \natoms of alkanes are substituted are known \nas substitution reactions. As an example, chlorination of methane is given below:HalogenationCH2 + C1 hv     CH3C1 + HC1 Chloromethane (9.10)CH3C1  +  hv CH2 C12 + HC1 Dichloromethane (9.11)CH2C12  hv  CHC13 + HC1 Trichloromethane (9.12)CHC13  +  C12  hv  CC14 + HC1 Tetrachloromethane (9.13)Table 9.2 Variation of Melting Point and Boiling Point in AlkanesMolecular  Name Molecular b.p./(K) m.p./(K)formula  mass/u  CH4 Methane 16 111.0 90.5C2H6 Ethane 30 184.4 101.0C3H8 Propane 44 230.9 85.3C4H10 Butane 58 272.4 134.6C4H10 2-Methylpropane 58 261.0 114.7C5H12 Pentane 72 309.1 143.3C5H12 2-Methylbutane 72 300.9 113.1C5H12 2,2-Dimethylpropane 72 282.5 256.4C6H14 Hexane 86 341.9 178.5C7H16 Heptane 100 371.4 182.4C8H18 Octane 114 398.7 216.2C9H20 Nonane 128 423.8 222.0C10H22 Decane 142 447.1 243.3C20H42 Eicosane 282 615.0 236.2Unit 9.indd   30210/10/2022   10:37:54 AM303CH3–CH3  +  C12  hv  CH3–CH2C1   +   HC1 Chloroethane (9.14) It is found that the rate of reaction of alkanes with halogens is F2 \u003e Cl2 \u003e Br2 \u003e I2. Rate of replacement of hydrogens of alkanes is :  3° \u003e 2° \u003e 1°. Fluorination is too violent to be controlled. Iodination is very slow and a \nreversible reaction. It can be carried out in the \npresence of oxidizing agents like HIO3 or HNO3.CH4+I2  CH3I+HI (9.15)HIO3+5HI→312+3H2O (9.16) Halogenation is supposed to proceed via free radical chain mechanism involving three steps namely initiation, propagation and termination as given below:Mechanism (i) Initiation : The reaction is initiated by homolysis of chlorine molecule in the presence of light or heat. The Cl–Cl bond �is weaker than the C–C and C–H bond and \nhence, is easiest to break.C1–C1   hvhomolysis C.   H3 + C1   Chlorine free radicals(ii) Propagation : Chlorine free radical attacks the methane molecule and takes the reaction in the forward direction by breaking \nthe C-H bond to generate methyl free radical \nwith the formation of H-Cl.(a) CH4 +  C+ 1  hv C+  H3 + H–C1 The methyl radical thus obtained attacks the second molecule of chlorine to form  CH3 – Cl with the liberation of another chlorine free radical by homolysis of chlorine molecule.\n(b) CH3 +  C1–C1 hv CH3 – C1 + C1 The chlorine and methyl free radicals generated above repeat steps (a) and (b) respectively and thereby setup a chain of reactions. The propagation steps (a) and \n(b) are those which directly give principal \nproducts, but many other propagation steps are possible and may occur. Two such steps given below explain how more highly \nhaloginated products are formed.CH3C1 + C.   1 → C.   H2C1 + HC1C.   H2C1 + C1– C1 → CH2C12  + C.   1(iii)  Termination: The reaction stops after some time due to consumption of reactants  and / or due to the following side reactions : The possible chain terminating steps are:(a) C.   1 + C.   1 → C1–C1(b) H3 C.    + C.    H3 → H3C– CH3(c) H3 C.   1  +  C.   1  →  H3C–C1 Though in (c), CH3 – Cl,  the one of the products is formed but free radicals are consumed and the chain is terminated. The \nabove mechanism helps us to understand \nthe reason for the formation of ethane as a \nbyproduct during chlorination of methane. 2. Combustion Alkanes on heating in the presence of air or dioxygen are completely oxidized to carbon \ndioxide and water with the evolution of large \namount of heat.4222è-1c410222è-1cCH(g)20(g)CO(g)2HO(1);ÄH890kJmol(9.17)CH(g)13/2O(g)4CO(g)5HO(1)ÄH2875.84kJmol(9.18)+→+−+→+=−        The general combustion equation for any alkane is :n2n+22223n1CHOnCO(n1)HO2++→++ (9.19) Due to the evolution of large amount of heat during combustion, alkanes are used as fuels.During incomplete combustion of alkanes with insufficient amount of air or dioxygen, carbon black is formed which is used in \nthe manufacture of ink, printer ink, black \npigments and as filters.Unit 9.indd   30310/10/2022   10:37:54 AM304CH4(g) + O2(g) incompletecombustion C(s)+2H2 O(1) (9.20)3.

Isomerisation \nn-Alkanes on heating in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride and hydrogen chloride gas isomerise to branched chain \nalkanes. Major products are given below. \nSome minor products are also possible which \nyou can think over. Minor products are \ngenerally not reported in organic reactions.CH3(CH)2)4CH3Anhy, AICI3/ HCI  n-Hexane \nCH3CH–(CH2)2–CH3+CH3CH2–CH–CH2–CH3   CH3 CH32-Methylpentane 3-Methylpenatone(9.25)5. Aromatization \nn-Alkanes having six or more carbon atoms \non heating to 773K at 10-20 atmospheric pressure in the presence of oxides of vanadium, molybdenum or chromium supported over \nalumina get dehydrogenated and cyclised to \nbenzene and its homologues. This reaction is \nknown as aromatization or reforming.(9.26) Toluene (C7H8) is methyl derivative of benzene. Which alkane do you suggest for \npreparation of toluene ?6. Reaction with steam  Methane reacts with steam at 1273 K in the \npresence of nickel catalyst to form carbon \nmonoxide and dihydrogen. This method is \nused for industrial preparation of dihydrogen \ngasCH4  +  H2IO Ni∆ CO  +  3H2 (9.27)7. Pyrolysis Higher alkanes on heating to higher \ntemperature decompose into lower alkanes, \nalkenes etc. Such a decomposition reaction \ninto smaller fragments by the application of heat is called pyrolysis or cracking.(9.28) Pyrolysis of alkanes is believed to be a free radical reaction. Preparation of oil gas \nor petrol gas from kerosene oil or petrol involves the principle of pyrolysis. For \nexample, dodecane, a constituent of kerosene \noil on heating to 973K in the presence of \nplatinum, palladium or nickel gives a mixture \nof heptane and pentene.C12H26 Pt/Pd/Ni973K C7H16  +  C5H10 + Other ProductsDodecane Heptane Pentene(9.29)Unit 9.indd   30403-05-2024   16:28:293059.2.4 ConformationsAlkanes contain carbon-carbon sigma (σ) bonds. Electron distribution of the sigma molecular orbital is symmetrical around the �internuclear axis of the C–C bond which is \nnot disturbed due to rotation about its axis. �This permits free rotation about C–C single \nbond. This rotation results into different \nspatial arrangements of atoms in space \nwhich can change into one another. Such \nspatial arrangements of atoms which can \nbe converted into one another by rotation \naround a C-C single bond are called \nconformations or conformers or rotamers. Alkanes can thus have infinite number of \nconformations by rotation around C-C single \nbonds. However, it may be remembered that \nrotation around a C-C single bond is not \ncompletely free. It is hindered by a small \nenergy barrier of 1-20 kJ mol–1 due to weak repulsive interaction between the adjacent \nbonds. Such a type of repulsive interaction \nis called torsional strain. Conformations of ethane : Ethane molecule (C2H6) contains a carbon – carbon single bond with each carbon atom attached \nto three hydrogen atoms.  Considering the \nball and stick model of ethane, keep one \ncarbon atom stationary and rotate the other \ncarbon atom around the C-C axis. This \nrotation results into infinite number of spatial \narrangements of hydrogen atoms attached to \none carbon atom with respect to the hydrogen \natoms attached to the other carbon atom. \nThese are called conformational isomers (conformers). Thus there are infinite number \nof conformations of ethane. However, there are \ntwo extreme cases. One such conformation \nin which hydrogen atoms attached to two \ncarbons are as closed together as possible is \ncalled eclipsed conformation and the other in which hydrogens are as far apart as possible \nis known as the staggered conformation. Any other intermediate conformation is called a \nskew conformation.It may be remembered that in all the conformations, the bond angles \nand the bond lengths remain the same. \nEclipsed and the staggered conformations can be represented by Sawhorse and Newman projections.1. Sawhorse projections \nIn this projection, the molecule is viewed \nalong the molecular axis. It is then projected �on paper by drawing the central C–C bond \nas a somewhat longer straight line. Upper \nend of the line is  slightly tilted towards \nright or left hand side. The front carbon is \nshown at the lower end of the line, whereas \nthe rear carbon is shown at the upper end. \nEach carbon has three lines attached to it \ncorresponding to three hydrogen atoms. �The lines are inclined at an angle of 120° to \neach other. Sawhorse projections of eclipsed \nand staggered conformations of ethane are \ndepicted in Fig. 9.2.2. Newman projections In this projection, the molecule is viewed at the �C–C bond head on. The carbon atom nearer \nto the eye is represented by a point. Three \nhydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon \natom are shown by three lines drawn at an �angle of 120° to each other. The rear carbon \natom (the carbon atom away from the eye) is \nrepresented by a circle and the three hydrogen \natoms are shown attached to it by the shorter �lines drawn at an angle of 120° to each other. \nThe Newman’s projections are depicted in  Fig. 9.3.Fig. 9.2  Sawhorse projections of ethaneFig. 9.3  Newman’s projections of ethaneUnit 9.indd   30510/10/2022   10:37:54 AM306Fig. 9.4 Orbital picture of ethene depicting  σ bonds onlyRelative stability of conformations: As mentioned earlier, in staggered form of ethane, the electron clouds of carbon-hydrogen bonds \nare as far apart as possible. Thus, there are \nminimum repulsive forces, minimum energy \nand maximum stability of the molecule. On the \nother hand, when the staggered form changes \ninto the eclipsed form, the electron clouds of the �carbon – hydrogen bonds come closer to each \nother resulting in increase in electron cloud \nrepulsions. To check the increased repulsive \nforces, molecule will have to possess more \nenergy and thus has lesser stability. As already \nmentioned, the repulsive interaction between \nthe electron clouds, which affects stability of \na conformation, is called torsional strain.  \nMagnitude of torsional strain depends upon �the angle of rotation about C–C bond. This \nangle is also called dihedral angle or torsional angle. Of all the conformations of ethane, the \nstaggered form has the least torsional strain \nand the eclipsed form, the maximum torsional \nstrain. Therefore, staggered conformation is \nmore stable than the eclipsed conformation. \nHence, molecule largely remains in staggered \nconformation or we can say that it is preferred \nconformation. Thus it may be inferred that �rotation around C–C bond in ethane is not \ncompletely free.  The energy difference between \nthe two extreme forms is of the order of 12.5 \nkJ mol–1, which is very small. Even at ordinary temperatures, the ethane molecule gains \nthermal or kinetic energy sufficient enough to \novercome this energy barrier of 12.5 kJ mol–1 through intermolecular collisions. Thus, it \ncan be said that rotation about carbon-carbon \nsingle bond in ethane is almost free for all \npractical purposes. It has not been possible to \nseparate and isolate different conformational \nisomers of ethane.9.3 ALKENESAlkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing at least one double bond. What should be the general formula of alkenes? If \nthere is one double bond between two carbon \natoms in alkenes, they must possess two \nhydrogen atoms less than alkanes. Hence, \ngeneral formula for alkenes is CnH2n. Alkenes are also known as olefins (oil forming) since the first member, ethylene or ethene (C2H4) was found to form an oily liquid on reaction \nwith chlorine.9.3.1 Structure of Double BondCarbon-carbon double bond in alkenes consists of one strong sigma (σ) bond (bond enthalpy about 397 kJ mol–1) due to head-on overlapping of sp2 hybridised orbitals and one weak pi (π) bond (bond enthalpy about \n284 kJ mol–1) obtained by lateral or sideways overlapping of the two 2p orbitals of the two \ncarbon atoms. The double bond is shorter in �bond length (134 pm) than the C–C single \nbond (154 pm). You have already read that \nthe pi (π) bond is a weaker bond due to poor \nsideways overlapping between the two 2p \norbitals. Thus, the presence of the pi (π) bond \nmakes alkenes behave as sources of loosely \nheld mobile electrons. Therefore, alkenes are \neasily attacked by reagents or compounds \nwhich are in search of electrons. Such \nreagents are called electrophilic reagents. \nThe presence of weaker π-bond makes alkenes unstable molecules in comparison to alkanes \nand thus, alkenes can be changed into single \nbond compounds by combining with the \nelectrophilic reagents. Strength of the double \nbond (bond enthalpy, 681 kJ mol–1) is greater than that of a carbon-carbon single bond in \nethane (bond enthalpy, 348 kJ mol–1). Orbital diagrams of ethene molecule are shown in  Figs. 9.4 and 9.5.9.3.2 NomenclatureFor nomenclature of alkenes in IUPAC system, the longest chain of carbon atoms containing the double bond is selected. Numbering of the \nchain is done from the end which is nearer to Unit 9.indd   30611/10/2022   15:26:35307the double bond. The suffix ‘ene’ replaces ‘ane’ of alkanes. It may be remembered that  first member of alkene series is: CH2 (replacing n by 1 in CnH2n) known as methene but has a very short life. As already mentioned, first \nstable member of alkene series is C2H4 known as ethylene (common) or ethene (IUPAC). \nIUPAC names of a few members of alkenes \nare given below :Structure IUPAC nameCH3 – CH = CH2 PropeneCH3 – CH2 – CH = CH2 But – l - eneCH3 – CH = CH–CH3 But-2-eneCH2 = CH – CH = CH2 Buta – 1,3 - dieneCH2 = C – CH3 2-Methylprop-1-ene          |          CH3CH2 = CH – CH – CH3 3-Methylbut-1-ene          |          CH3Problem  9.7Write IUPAC names of the following compounds:(i) (CH3)2CH – CH =  CH – CH2 – CH   \t\t\t\t    CH3 – CH – CH         |         C2H5(ii)(iii) CH2 = C (CH2CH2CH3)2(iv) CH3 CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2CH3 | |     CH3 – CHCH = C – CH2 – CHCH3   |   CH3Solution(i) 2,8-Dimethyl-3, 6-decadiene;(ii) 1,3,5,7 Octatetraene; (iii) 2-n-Propylpent-1-ene;(iv) 4-Ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-dec-4-ene;Problem 9.8Calculate number of sigma (σ) and pi (π) bonds in the above structures (i-iv).Solutionσ bonds : 33, π bonds : 2σ bonds : 17, π bonds : 4σ bonds : 23, π bond : 1σ bonds : 41, π bond : 19.3.3 Isomerism Alkenes show both structural isomerism and geometrical isomerism.Structural isomerism : As in alkanes, ethene (C2H4) and propene (C3H6) can have only one structure but alkenes higher than propene have different structures. Alkenes possessing \nC4H8 as molecular formula can be written in the following three ways:I. 1 2 3 4 CH2 = CH – CH2 – CH3  But-1-ene (C4H8)   II.  1  2  3  4 CH3 – CH = CH – CH3  But-2-ene (C4H8)Fig. 9.5 Orbital picture of ethene showing formation of (a) π-bond, (b) π-cloud and (c) bond angles and bond lengths Unit 9.indd   30710/10/2022   10:37:55 AM308III. 1 2 3 CH2 = C – CH3 | CH3 2-Methylprop-1-ene (C4H8) Structures I and III, and II and III are the examples of chain isomerism whereas structures I and II are position isomers.Problem 9.9Write structures and IUPAC names of different structural isomers of alkenes \ncorresponding to C5H10.Solution(a) CH2 = CH – CH2 – CH2 – CH3  Pent-1-ene(b) CH3 – CH=CH  – CH2 – CH3 Pent-2-ene(c) CH3 – C = CH – CH3 | CH3 2-Methylbut-2-ene(d) CH3 – CH – CH = CH2 | CH3 3-Methylbut-1-ene(e) CH2 = C – CH2 – CH3 | CH3  2-Methylbut-1-ene Geometrical isomerism: Doubly bonded carbon atoms have to satisfy the remaining two valences by joining with two atoms or \ngroups. If the two atoms or groups attached to each carbon atom are different, they can \nbe represented by YX C = C XY like structure.  YX C = C XY can be represented in space in \nthe following two ways : In (a), the two identical atoms i.e., both the X or both the Y lie on the same side \nof the double bond but in (b) the two X or \ntwo Y lie across the double bond or on the \nopposite sides of the double bond. This results in different geometry of (a) and (b) i.e. \ndisposition of atoms or groups in space in \nthe two arrangements is different. Therefore, \nthey are stereoisomers. They would have the \nsame geometry if atoms or groups around \nC=C bond can be rotated but rotation around \nC=C bond is not free. It is restricted. For \nunderstanding this concept, take two pieces \nof strong cardboards and join them with the \nhelp of two nails. Hold one cardboard in your \none hand and try to rotate the other. Can \nyou really rotate the other cardboard ? The \nanswer is no. The rotation is restricted. This \nillustrates that the restricted rotation of atoms \nor groups around the doubly bonded carbon \natoms gives rise to different geometries of \nsuch compounds. The stereoisomers of this \ntype are called geometrical isomers. The \nisomer of the type (a), in which two identical \natoms or groups lie on the same side of the \ndouble bond is called cis  isomer and the other isomer of the type (b), in which identical \natoms or groups lie on the opposite sides of \nthe double bond is called trans isomer . Thus cis and trans isomers have the same structure but have different configuration (arrangement \nof atoms or groups in space). Due to different \narrangement of atoms or groups in space, \nthese isomers differ in their properties like \nmelting point, boiling point, dipole moment, \nsolubility etc. Geometrical or cis-trans isomers \nof but-2-ene are represented below : Cis form of alkene is found to be more polar than the trans form. For example, dipole moment of cis-but-2-ene is 0.33 Debye, \nwhereas, dipole moment of the trans form  is almost zero or it can be said that  Unit 9.indd   30803-05-2024   16:07:55309trans-but-2-ene is non-polar. This can be understood by drawing geometries of the two \nforms as given below from which it is clear \nthat in the trans-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups are in opposite directions, Threfore, \ndipole moments of C-CH3 bonds cancel, thus  making the trans form non-polar. (ii) CH2 = CBr2(iii) C6H5CH = CH – CH3(iv) CH3CH = CCl CH3Solution(iii) and (iv). In structures (i) and (ii), two \nidentical groups are attached to one of \nthe doubly bonded carbon atom.9.3.4 Preparation 1. From alkynes: Alkynes on partial reduction with calculated amount of dihydrogen in the presence of palladised charcoal partially deactivated with poisons \nlike sulphur compounds or quinoline give \nalkenes. Partially deactivated palladised \ncharcoal is known as Lindlar’s catalyst. \nAlkenes thus obtained are having cis geometry. However, alkynes on reduction \nwith sodium in liquid ammonia form trans alkenes.(9.30)(9.31)iii) CH≡ CH+H2 Pd/C CH2 =CH2     (9.32) Ethyne Etheneiv) CH3–C≡ CH+H2 Pd/C CH3–CH =CH2 Propyne Propene(9.33) Will propene thus obtained show geometrical isomerism? Think for the reason in support of your answer.2. From alkyl halides: Alkyl halides (R-X) on heating with alcoholic potash (potassium \nhydroxide dissolved in alcohol, say,  In the case of solids, it is observed that the trans isomer has higher melting point than the cis form.

This reaction is \nknown as dehydrohalogenation i.e., \nremoval of halogen acid. This is example \nof β-elimination reaction, since hydrogen atom is eliminated from the β carbon atom (carbon atom next to the carbon to which \nhalogen is attached). (9.34) Nature of halogen atom and the alkyl group determine rate of the reaction. It is observed \nthat for halogens, the rate is: iodine \u003e \nbromine \u003e chlorine, while for alkyl groups \nit is : tertiary \u003e secondary \u003e primary. 3. From vicinal dihalides: Dihalides in which two halogen atoms are attached \nto  two adjacent carbon atoms are known as vicinal dihalides. Vicinal dihalides on treatment with zinc metal lose a molecule \nof ZnX2 to form an alkene. This reaction is known  as dehalogenation.CH2Br–CH2Br + Zn  CH2=CH2+ ZnBr2(9.35)CH3CHBr–CH2Br + Zn  CH3CH=CH2  +ZnBr2(9.36)4. From alcohols by acidic dehydration: \nYou have read during nomenclature of different homologous series in Unit 12 \nthat alcohols are the hydroxy derivatives �of alkanes. They are represented by R–OH \nwhere, R is CnH2n+1. Alcohols on heating with concentrated sulphuric acid form \nalkenes with the elimination of one water \nmolecule. Since a water molecule is \neliminated from the alcohol molecule in \nthe presence of an acid, this reaction is \nknown as acidic dehydration of alcohols. This reaction is also the example of   β-elimination reaction since –OH group takes out one hydrogen atom from the  β-carbon atom.(9.37)9.3.5 PropertiesPhysical properties\nAlkenes as a class resemble alkanes in physical properties, except in types of \nisomerism and difference in polar nature. \nThe first three members are gases, the next \nfourteen are liquids and the higher ones are \nsolids. Ethene is a colourless gas with a faint \nsweet smell. All other alkenes are colourless \nand odourless, insoluble in water but fairly \nsoluble in non-polar solvents like benzene, \npetroleum ether. They show a regular increase \nin boiling point with increase in size i.e., every �– CH2 group added increases boiling point by 20–30 K. Like alkanes, straight chain alkenes \nhave higher boiling point than isomeric \nbranched chain compounds.Chemical propertiesAlkenes are the rich source of loosely held  pi (π) electrons, due to which they show addition reactions in which the electrophiles \nadd on to the carbon-carbon double bond to \nform the addition products.  Some reagents \nalso add by free radical mechanism. There \nare cases when under special conditions, \nalkenes also undergo free radical substitution �reactions. Oxidation and ozonolysis reactions \nare also quite prominent in alkenes. A brief \ndescription of different reactions of alkenes \nis given  below:1. Addition of dihydrogen: Alkenes add up one molecule of dihydrogen gas in the presence of finely divided nickel, \npalladium or platinum to form alkanes \n(Section 9.2.2)2. Addition of halogens : Halogens like bromine or chlorine add up to alkene to \nform vicinal dihalides. However, iodine does not show addition reaction under Unit 9.indd   31003-05-2024   16:08:27311normal conditions. The reddish orange colour of bromine solution in carbon \ntetrachloride is discharged when bromine \nadds up to an unsaturation site. This \nreaction is used as a test for unsaturation. \nAddition of halogens to alkenes is an \nexample of electrophilic addition reaction \ninvolving cyclic halonium ion formation \nwhich you will study in higher classes.(9.38) (9.39)3. Addition of hydrogen halides: Hydrogen halides (HCl, HBr,HI) add up to alkenes to form alkyl halides. The order of reactivity of the hydrogen halides is  HI \u003e HBr \u003e HCl. Like addition of halogens \nto alkenes, addition of hydrogen halides is \nalso an example of electrophilic addition \nreaction. Let us illustrate this by taking \naddition of HBr to symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkenes Addition reaction of HBr to symmetrical alkenes\nAddition reactions of HBr to symmetrical \nalkenes (similar groups attached to double \nbond) take place by electrophilic addition \nmechanism. CH2=CH2+H–Br  CH3–CH2–Br (9.40)CH3–CH=CH–CH3+HBr  CH3–CH–CHCH3  Br(9.41)Addition reaction of HBr to unsymmetrical alkenes (Markovnikov Rule)�How will H – Br add to propene ? The two possible products are I and II.(9.42)Markovnikov, a Russian chemist made a \ngeneralisation in 1869 after studying such \nreactions in detail. These generalisations \nled Markovnikov to frame a rule called \nMarkovnikov rule. The rule states that \nnegative part of the addendum (adding \nmolecule) gets attached to that carbon atom \nwhich possesses lesser number of hydrogen \natoms. Thus according to this rule, product \nI i.e., 2-bromopropane is expected. In actual practice, this is the principal product of the \nreaction. This generalisation of Markovnikov \nrule can be better understood in terms of \nmechanism of the reaction.Mechanism Hydrogen bromide provides an electrophile, \nH+, which attacks the double bond to form carbocation as shown below :(i)  The secondary carbocation (b) is more \nstable than the primary carbocation \n(a), therefore, the former predominates because it is formed at a faster rate.(ii)  The carbocation (b) is attacked by Br– ion to form the  product as follows :2-Bromopropane (major product)(a) less stable primary carbocation(b) more stable secondary carbocationUnit 9.indd   31110/27/2022   2:19:43 PM312Anti Markovnikov addition or peroxide effect or Kharash effectIn the presence of peroxide, addition of HBr \nto unsymmetrical alkenes like propene takes \nplace contrary to the Markovnikov rule. This \nhappens only with HBr but not with HCl \nand Hl. This addition reaction was observed  by M.S. Kharash and F.R. Mayo in 1933 \nat the University of Chicago. This reaction \nis known as peroxide or Kharash effect  or addition reaction anti to Markovnikov  rule.CH3 – CH=CH2+HBr (C6H5CO)2O2 CH3–CH2 CH2Br1–Bromopropane(9.43)Mechanism : Peroxide effect proceeds via free radical chain mechanism as given below:(ii) C.   6H5+H–Br Homolysis C6H3+ B.   r The secondary free radical obtained in the above mechanism (step iii) is more stable than the primary. This explains the formation of  1-bromopropane as the major product. It may be noted that the peroxide effect is not observed \nin addition of HCl and HI. This may be due  to the fact that the H–Cl bond being  stronger (430.5 kJ mol–1) than H–Br bond  (363.7 kJ mol–1), is not cleaved by the  free radical, whereas the H–I bond is weaker  (296.8 kJ mol–1) and iodine free radicals combine to form iodine molecules instead of \nadding to the double bond. Problem 9.12Write IUPAC names of the products obtained by addition reactions of HBr to  \nhex-1-ene (i) in the absence of peroxide and  (ii) in the presence of peroxide.Solution4. Addition of sulphuric acid : Cold concentrated sulphuric acid adds to alkenes in accordance with Markovnikov rule to form alkyl hydrogen sulphate by \nthe electrophilic addition reaction.(i)Unit 9.indd   31210/10/2022   10:37:56 AM313(9.44)(9.45)5. Addition of water : In the presence of a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid alkenes react with water to form alcohols, in accordance with the Markovnikov rule.(9.46)6. Oxidation: Alkenes on reaction with cold, dilute, aqueous solution of potassium \npermanganate (Baeyer’s reagent) produce vicinal glycols. Decolorisation of KMnO4 solution is used as a test for unsaturation.(9.47)(9.48)b) Acidic potassium permanganate or acidic \npotassium dichromate oxidises alkenes to ketones and/or acids depending upon the nature of the alkene and the experimental \nconditions (9.49)CH3 – CH=CH–CH3 KMnO4/H+ 2CH3COOHBut-2-ene Ethanoic acid(9.50)7. Ozonolysis : Ozonolysis of alkenes \ninvolves the addition of ozone molecule to alkene to form ozonide, and then cleavage \nof the ozonide by Zn-H2O to smaller molecules. This reaction is highly useful \nin detecting the position of the double \nbond in alkenes or other unsaturated \ncompounds. (9.51)(9.52)8. Polymerisation: You are familiar with polythene bags and polythene sheets. Polythene is obtained by the combination \nof large number of ethene molecules at \nhigh temperature, high pressure and \nin the presence of a catalyst. The large \nmolecules thus obtained are called \npolymers. This reaction is known as \npolymerisation. The simple compounds from which polymers are made are called Unit 9.indd   31303-05-2024   16:08:51314monomers. Other alkenes also undergo polymerisation.n(CH2 =CH2) High temp./pressureCatalyst —(  CH2–CH2 )— Polythene(9.53)n(CH3 –CH=CH2) High temp./pressureCatalyst —(  CH–CH2 )—n  CH3Polypropene(9.54) Polymers are used for the manufacture of plastic \nbags, squeeze bottles, refrigerator dishes, toys, pipes, radio and T.V. cabinets etc. Polypropene \nis used for the manufacture of milk crates, \nplastic buckets and other moulded articles. \nThough these materials have now become \ncommon, excessive use of polythene and \npolypropylene is a matter of great concern for \nall of us.9.4 ALKYNESLike alkenes, alkynes are also unsaturated hydrocarbons. They contain at least one triple bond between two carbon atoms. The number \nof hydrogen atoms is still less in alkynes as \ncompared to alkenes or alkanes. Their general \nformula is CnH2n–2.  The first stable member of alkyne series is ethyne which is popularly known as \nacetylene. Acetylene is used for arc welding \npurposes in the form of oxyacetylene flame \nobtained by mixing acetylene with oxygen \ngas. Alkynes are starting materials for a large \nnumber of organic compounds. Hence, it \nis interesting to study this class of organic \ncompounds.9.4.1 Nomenclature and IsomerismIn common system, alkynes are named as derivatives of acetylene. In IUPAC system, they are named as derivatives of the corresponding \nalkanes replacing ‘ane’ by the suffix ‘yne’. \nThe position of the triple bond is indicated \nby the first triply bonded carbon. Common \nand IUPAC names of a few members of alkyne \nseries are given in Table 9.2. You have already learnt that ethyne and propyne have got only one structure but there are two possible structures for butyne –  (i) but-1-yne and (ii) but-2-yne. Since these \ntwo compounds differ in their structures \ndue to the position of the triple bond, they \nare known as position isomers. In how \nmany ways, you can construct the structure \nfor the next homologue i.e., the next alkyne \nwith molecular formula  C5H8? Let us try to arrange five carbon atoms with a continuous \nchain and with a side chain. Following are the \npossible structures : Structure IUPAC nameI.   1 2 3 4 5HC≡ C– CH2– CH2– CH3 Pent–1-yneII.  1 2 3  4 5H3C–C≡ C– CH2– CH3 Pent–2-yneIII.   4 3 2  1H3C–CH–C≡  CH | CH3          3-Methyl but–1-yne Structures I and II are position isomers and structures I and III or II and III are chain \nisomers.Problem 9.13Write structures of different isomers \ncorresponding to the 5th member of alkyne series. Also write IUPAC names of \nall the isomers. What type of isomerism \nis exhibited by different pairs of isomers?Solution 5th member of alkyne has the molecular formula C6H10.

Structure of ethyne is shown in  Fig. 9.6. Each carbon atom of ethyne has two sp hybridised orbitals. Carbon-carbon sigma (σ) bond is obtained by the head-on overlapping \nof the two sp hybridised orbitals of the two \ncarbon atoms. The remaining sp hybridised \norbital of each carbon atom undergoes \noverlapping along the internuclear axis with \nthe 1s orbital of each of the two hydrogen atoms forming two C-H sigma bonds. �H-C-C bond angle is of 180°. Each carbon \nhas two unhybridised p orbitals which are perpendicular to each other as well as to the \nplane of the C-C sigma bond. The 2p orbitals \nof one carbon atom are parallel to the 2p orbitals of the other carbon atom, which undergo lateral or sideways overlapping to \nform two pi (π) bonds between two carbon \natoms. Thus ethyne molecule consists of one �C–C σ bond,  two C–H σ bonds and two C–C π bonds. The strength of C≡C bond (bond enthalpy 823 kJ mol-1) is more than those of C=C bond (bond enthalpy 681 kJ mol–1) and C–C bond (bond enthalpy 348 kJ mol–1). The C≡C bond length is shorter (120 pm) than those of C=C (133 pm) and C–C (154 \npm). Electron cloud between two carbon \natoms is cylindrically symmetrical about the \ninternuclear axis. Thus, ethyne is a linear \nmolecule.9.4.3 Preparation1. From calcium carbide: On industrial scale, ethyne is prepared by treating calcium carbide with water. Calcium carbide is prepared by heating quick lime \nwith coke. Quick lime can be obtained by \nheating limestone as shown in the following  reactions:CaCO3 ∆ CaO + O2 (9.55)Fig. 9.6 Orbital picture of ethyne showing  (a) sigma overlaps (b) pi overlaps.Unit 9.indd   31511/10/2022   15:27:49316CaO + 3C   CaC2 + CO (9.56)  Calcium   carbideCaC2 + 2H2O   Ca(OH)2 + C2H2 (9.57)2. From vicinal dihalides : Vicinal dihalides on treatment with alcoholic potassium hydroxide undergo dehydrohalogenation. \nOne molecule of hydrogen halide is \neliminated to form alkenyl halide which \non treatment with sodamide gives alkyne.9.4.4  PropertiesPhysical propertiesPhysical properties of alkynes follow the same trend of alkenes and alkanes. First three \nmembers are gases, the next eight are liquids \nand the higher ones are solids. All alkynes \nare colourless. Ethyene has characteristic \nodour. Other members are odourless. Alkynes \nare weakly polar in nature. They are lighter \nthan water and immiscible with water but \nsoluble in organic solvents like ethers, carbon \ntetrachloride and benzene. Their  melting \npoint, boiling point and density increase with \nincrease in molar mass.Chemical propertiesAlkynes show acidic nature, addition reactions \nand polymerisation reactions as follows : A. Acidic character of alkyne: Sodium metal and sodamide (NaNH2) are strong bases. They react with ethyne to form sodium acetylide with the liberation of dihydrogen \ngas. These reactions have not been observed \nin case of ethene and ethane thus indicating \nthat ethyne is acidic in nature in comparison \nto ethene and ethane. Why is it so ? Has \nit something to do with their structures \nand the hybridisation ? You have read that hydrogen atoms in ethyne are attached to the sp hybridised carbon atoms whereas they are attached to sp2 hybridised carbon atoms in ethene and sp3 hybridised carbons in ethane. Due to the maximum percentage of s character (50%), the sp hybridised orbitals of carbon atoms in ethyne molecules have  \nhighest electronegativity; hence, these attract \nthe shared electron pair of the C-H bond of \nethyne to a greater extent than that of the \nsp2 hybridised orbitals of carbon in ethene and the sp3 hybridised orbital of carbon in ethane. Thus in ethyne, hydrogen atoms \ncan be liberated as protons more easily as \ncompared to ethene and ethane. Hence, \nhydrogen atoms of ethyne attached to triply \nbonded carbon atom are acidic in nature. You \nmay note that the hydrogen atoms attached \nto the triply bonded carbons are acidic but \nnot all the hydrogen atoms of alkynes.

What \nabout the above reactions with but-1-yne and \nbut-2-yne ? Alkanes, alkenes and alkynes \nfollow the following trend in their acidic \nbehaviour :i) CH ≡ CH \u003e H2C – CH2 \u003e CH3 –CH3ii) HC ≡ CH \u003e CH3 –C≡ CH \u003e\u003e CH3 –C≡C–CH3 B. Addition reactions: Alkynes contain a triple bond, so they add up, two molecules of dihydrogen, halogen, hydrogen halides etc. Formation of the addition product takes place \naccording to the following steps. Unit 9.indd   31610/10/2022   10:37:57 AM317  The addition product formed depends upon stability of vinylic cation. Addition in unsymmetrical alkynes takes place according to Markovnikov rule.

This is used as a test for unsaturation.(iii) Addition of hydrogen halidesTwo molecules of hydrogen halides (HCl, HBr, HI) add to alkynes to form gem dihalides (in which two halogens are attached to the same carbon atom)H–C≡C–H+H–Br  [CH2 = CH–Br]→ CHBr2 Bromoethene  CH31,1-Dibromoethane(9.65)(9.66)(iv)  Addition of waterLike alkanes and alkenes, alkynes are also immiscible and do not react with water. \nHowever, one molecule of water adds to \nalkynes on warming with mercuric sulphate \nand dilute sulphuric acid at 333 K to form \ncarbonyl compounds.(9.67)(9.68)(v) Polymerisation(a) Linear polymerisation: Under suitable conditions, linear polymerisation of ethyne \ntakes place to produce polyacetylene or polyethyne which is a high molecular \nweight polyene containing repeating units of  (CH = CH – CH =  CH ) and can be represented �as —(CH = CH – CH = CH)n— Under special conditions, this polymer conducts electricity. Unit 9.indd   31703-05-2024   16:36:52318Thin film of polyacetylene can be used as electrodes in batteries. These films are good \nconductors, lighter and cheaper than the \nmetal conductors.(b)  Cyclic polymerisation: Ethyne on passing through red hot iron tube at 873K undergoes cyclic polymerization. Three molecules polymerise to form benzene, which \nis the starting molecule for the preparation of \nderivatives of benzene, dyes, drugs and large \nnumber of other organic compounds. This is \nthe best route for entering from aliphatic to \naromatic compounds as discussed below:                                   (9.69)Problem 9.14How will you convert ethanoic acid into benzene?Solution9.5 AROMATIC HYDROCARBONThese hydrocarbons are also known as ‘arenes’. Since most of them possess pleasant odour (Greek; aroma meaning pleasant \nsmelling), the class of compounds was \nnamed as ‘aromatic compounds’. Most of such \ncompounds were found to contain benzene \nring. Benzene ring is highly unsaturated but in a majority of reactions of aromatic \ncompounds, the unsaturation of benzene ring \nis retained. However, there are examples of \naromatic hydrocarbons which do not contain a \nbenzene ring but instead contain other highly \nunsaturated ring.  Aromatic compounds \ncontaining benzene ring are known as \nbenzenoids and those not containing a \nbenzene ring are known as non-benzenoids. \nSome examples of arenes are given  below:    Benzene         Toluene NaphthaleneBiphenyl9.5.1 Nomenclature and IsomerismThe nomenclature and isomerism of aromatic hydrocarbons has already been discussed in Unit 8. All six hydrogen atoms in benzene \nare equivalent; so it forms one and only one \ntype of monosubstituted product. When two \nhydrogen atoms in benzene are replaced by \ntwo similar or different monovalent atoms or \ngroups, three different position isomers are \npossible. The 1, 2 or 1, 6 is known as the ortho (o–), the 1, 3 or 1, 5 as meta (m–) and the 1, 4 as para (p–) disubstituted compounds. A \nfew examples of derivatives of benzene are \ngiven below: Methylbenzene 1,2-Dimethylbenzene (Toluene)  (o-Xylene)Unit 9.indd   31811/10/2022   15:28:313191,3 Dimethylbenzene 1,4-Dimethylbenzene (m-Xylene)              ( p-Xylene)9.5.2 Structure of BenzeneBenzene was isolated by Michael Faraday in 1825. The molecular formula of benzene, \nC6H6, indicates a high degree of unsaturation. This molecular formula did not account for \nits relationship to corresponding alkanes, \nalkenes and alkynes which you have studied \nin earlier sections of this unit. What do you \nthink about its possible structure? Due to \nits unique properties and unusual stability, \nit took several years to assign its structure. \nBenzene was found to be a stable molecule \nand found to form a triozonide which indicates \nthe presence of three double bonds. Benzene was further found to produce one and only one monosubstituted derivative which indicated \nthat all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms \nof benzene are identical. On the basis of this \nobservation August Kekulé in 1865 proposed \nthe following structure for benzene having \ncyclic arrangement of six carbon atoms with \nalternate single and double bonds and one \nhydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom.  The Kekulé structure indicates the possibility of two isomeric  1, 2-dibromobenzenes. In one of the isomers, the bromine atoms are attached to the \ndoubly bonded carbon atoms whereas in the \nother, they are attached to the singly bonded carbons.Friedrich August Kekulé,a German chemist was born in 1829 at Darmsdt in Germany. He became Professor in 1856 and Fellow of Royal Society in 1875. He \nmade major contribution to structural organic chemistry by proposing in 1858 that \ncarbon atoms can join to one another to form chains and later in 1865,he found \nan answer to the challenging problem of benzene structure by suggesting that \nthese chains can close to form rings. He gave the dynamic structural  formula to \nbenzene which forms the basis for its modern electronic structure. He described \nthe discovery of benzene structure later as: “I was sitting writing at my textbook,but the work did not progress; my thoughts were elsewhere. I turned my chair to the fire, and dozed. Again the atoms were \ngambolling before my eyes. This time the smaller groups kept modestly in the \nbackground. My mental eye, rendered more acute by repeated visions of this \nkind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold  conformations; long \nrows,sometimes more closely fitted together; all twisting and turning in snake like motion. But look! What \nwas that? One of the snakes had seized hold of it’s own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my \neyes. As if by a flash of lightning I woke;.... I spent the rest of the night working out the consequences of \nthe hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth but let us \nbeware of making our dreams public before they have been approved by the waking mind.”( 1890). One hundred years later, on the occasion of Kekulé’s centenary celebrations a group of compounds having polybenzenoid structures have been named as Kekulenes. FRIEDRICH AUGUST KEKULÉ(7th September 1829–13th July 1896)Unit 9.indd   31910/10/2022   10:37:58 AM320  However, benzene was found to form only one ortho disubstituted product. This problem was overcome by Kekulé by suggesting the concept of oscillating nature of double bonds \nin benzene as given below. Even with this modification, Kekulé structure of benzene  fails to explain unusual \nstability and preference to substitution  reactions than addition reactions, which \ncould later on be explained by resonance.Resonance and stability of benzeneAccording to Valence Bond Theory, the concept of oscillating double bonds in benzene \nis now explained by resonance. Benzene is a \nhybrid of various resonating structures. The \ntwo structures, A and B given by Kekulé  are the main contributing structures. The hybrid \nstructure is represented by inserting a circle \nor a dotted circle in the hexagon as shown \nin (C). The circle represents the six electrons \nwhich are delocalised between the six carbon \natoms of the benzene ring.   (A)     (B)                               (C) The orbital overlapping gives us better picture about the structure of benzene. All the six carbon atoms in benzene are sp2 hybridized. Two sp2 hybrid orbitals of each carbon atom overlap with sp2 hybrid orbitals of adjacent carbon atoms to form six C—C sigma bonds which are in the hexagonal \nplane. The remaining sp2 hybrid orbital of each carbon atom overlaps with s orbital of a hydrogen atom to form six C—H sigma bonds. Each carbon atom is now left with one unhybridised p orbital perpendicular to the plane of the ring as shown below: The unhybridised p orbital of carbon atoms are close enough to form a π bond by lateral overlap. There are two equal possibilities of \nforming three π bonds by overlap of p orbitals of C1 –C2, C3  – C4, C5  – C6 or C2  – C3, C4  – C5, C6  – C1 respectively as shown in the following figures.Fig. 9.7 (a)Fig. 9.7 (b) Structures shown in Fig. 9.7(a) and (b) correspond to two Kekulé’s structure with localised π bonds. The internuclear distance Unit 9.indd   32011/10/2022   15:29:07321between all the carbon atoms in the ring has been determined by the X-ray diffraction to \nbe the same; there is equal probability for the \np orbital of each carbon atom to overlap with \nthe p orbitals of adjacent carbon atoms [Fig. 9.7 (c)]. This can be represented in the form \nof two doughtnuts (rings) of electron clouds \n[Fig. 9.7 (d)], one above and one below the \nplane of the hexagonal ring as shown below: Fig. 9.7 (c)                    Fig. 9.7 (d) The six π electrons are thus delocalised and can move freely about the six carbon nuclei, instead of any two as shown in  Fig. 9.6 (a) or (b). The delocalised π electron cloud is attracted more strongly by the nuclei of the \ncarbon atoms than the electron cloud localised \nbetween two carbon atoms. Therefore, presence \nof delocalised π electrons in benzene makes it more stable than the hypothetical \ncyclohexatriene. X-Ray diffraction data reveals that benzene is a planar molecule. Had any one of the above structures of benzene (A or B) been correct, two types of C—C bond lengths were expected. \nHowever, X-ray data indicates that all the \nsix C—C bond lengths are of the same order  (139 pm) which is  intermediate between  C— C single bond (154 pm) and C—C double \nbond (133 pm). Thus the absence of pure \ndouble bond in benzene accounts for the \nreluctance of benzene to show addition \nreactions under normal conditions, thus explaining the unusual behaviour of benzene.9.5.3 AromaticityBenzene was considered as parent ‘aromatic’ compound. Now, the name is applied to all the \nring systems whether or not having benzene \nring, possessing following characteristics.(i) Planarity(ii) Complete delocalisation of the π electrons \nin the ring(iii) Presence of (4n + 2) π electrons in the ring where n is an integer (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .).  This is often referred to as Hückel Rule.Some examples of aromatic compounds are given below:           9.5.4 Preparation of BenzeneBenzene is commercially isolated from coal \ntar. However, it may be prepared in the laboratory by the following methods.(i) Cyclic polymerisation of ethyne: (Section 9.4.4)(ii) Decarboxylation of aromatic acids: Sodium salt of benzoic acid on heating \nwith sodalime gives benzene.(9.70)(electron cloud)Unit 9.indd   32110/27/2022   2:18:31 PM322(iii) Reduction of phenol: Phenol is reduced to benzene by passing its vapours over heated zinc dust  (9.71)9.5.5 PropertiesPhysical properties Aromatic hydrocarbons are non- polar  molecules and are usually colourless liquids \nor solids with a characteristic aroma. You are \nalso familiar with naphthalene balls which are \nused in toilets and for preservation of clothes \nbecause of unique smell of the compound \nand the moth repellent property. Aromatic \nhydrocarbons are immiscible with water but \nare readily miscible with organic solvents. \nThey burn with sooty flame.Chemical properties Arenes are characterised by electrophilic \nsubstitution reactions. However, under \nspecial conditions they can also undergo \naddition and oxidation reactions.Electrophilic substitution reactionsThe common electrophilic substitution \nreactions of arenes are nitration, halogenation, \nsulphonation, Friedel Craft’s alkylation and \nacylation reactions in which attacking reagent \nis an electrophile (E+)(i) Nitration: A nitro group is introduced into benzene ring when benzene is heated \nwith a mixture of concentrated nitric acid \nand concentrated sulphuric acid (nitrating \nmixture). (9.72)               Nitrobenzene(ii) Halogenation: Arenes react with halogens in the presence of a Lewis acid like anhydrous FeCl3, FeBr3 or AlCl3 to yield haloarenes.Chlorobenzene (9.73)(iii) Sulphonation: The replacement of a hydrogen atom by a sulphonic acid group in a ring is called sulphonation. It is carried out \nby heating benzene with fuming sulphuric \nacid (oleum).(9.74)(iv) Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction: When benzene is treated with an alkyl halide \nin the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride, alkylbenene is formed. (9.75) (9.76) Why do we get isopropyl benzene on treating benzene with 1-chloropropane instead of n-propyl benzene?(v) Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction: The reaction of benzene with an acyl halide or acid anhydride in the presence of Lewis acids (AlCl3) yields acyl benzene.Unit 9.indd   32212/13/2022   10:16:03323(9.77) (9.78) If excess of electrophilic reagent is used, further substitution reaction may take place in which other hydrogen atoms of benzene \nring may also be successively replaced by the electrophile. For example, benzene \non treatment with excess of chlorine in \nthe presence of anhydrous AlCl3 can be chlorinated to hexachlorobenzene (C6Cl6)   (9.79)Mechanism of electrophilic substitution \nreactions:\nAccording to experimental evidences, SE (S = substitution; E = electrophilic) reactions are supposed to proceed via the following three \nsteps:(a) Generation of the eletrophile (b) Formation of carbocation intermediate(c) Removal of proton from the carbocation intermediate(a) Generation of electrophile E⊕: During chlorination, alkylation and acylation of \nbenzene, anhydrous AlCl3, being a Lewis acid helps in generation of the elctrophile Cl⊕, R⊕, RC⊕O (acylium ion) respectively by combining with the attacking reagent.  In the case of nitration, the electrophile, nitronium ion,  is produced by transfer of a proton (from sulphuric acid) to nitric acid in the following manner:Step I Step II Protonated Nitronium nitric acid ion It is interesting to note that in the process of generation of nitronium ion, sulphuric acid serves as an acid and nitric acid as a base. \nThus, it is a simple acid-base equilibrium.(b) Formation of Carbocation   (arenium ion): Attack of electrophile results in the formation of σ-complex or arenium ion in which one of the carbon is sp3 hybridised.   sigma complex (arenium ion) The arenium ion  gets stabilised by resonance:Unit 9.indd   32312/1/2022   11:04:17324 Sigma complex or arenium ion loses its aromatic character because delocalisation of electrons stops at sp3 hybridised carbon.(c)  Removal of proton: To restore the aromatic character, σ -complex releases proton from sp3 hybridised carbon on attack by [AlCl4]– (in case of halogenation, alkylation and acylation) and [HSO4]– (in case of nitration).Addition reactions\nUnder  vigorous conditions, i.e., at high \ntemperature and/ or pressure in the presence \nof nickel catalyst, hydrogenation of benzene \ngives cyclohexane.   Cyclohexane(9.80) Under ultra-violet light, three chlorine molecules add to benzene to produce benzene hexachloride, C6H6Cl6 which is also called gammaxane.Benzene hexachloride,       (BHC)(9.81)Combustion: When heated in air, benzene burns with sooty flame producing CO2 and H2O6222615CHO26CO+3HO+→ (9.82)General combustion reaction for any hydrocarbon may be given by the following chemical equation:CxHy + (x + ) O2 → x CO2 +  H2O  n (9.83)9.5.6 Directive influence of a functional group in monosubstituted benzeneWhen monosubstituted benzene is subjected to further substitution, three possible disubstituted products are not formed in \nequal amounts. Two types of behaviour are \nobserved. Either ortho and para products or \nmeta product is predominantly formed. It has also been observed that this behaviour \ndepends on the nature of the substituent \nalready present in the benzene ring and not \non the nature of the entering group. This is \nknown as directive influence of substituents. \nReasons for ortho/para or meta directive nature of groups are discussed below:Ortho and para directing groups: The groups which direct the incoming group to ortho and para positions are called ortho and para directing groups. As an example, let us \ndiscuss the directive influence of phenolic  (–OH) group. Phenol is resonance hybrid of following structures:It is clear from the above resonating structures that the electron density is more on o – and p – positions. Hence, the substitution takes place mainly at these positions. However, �it may be noted that –I effect of – OH group also \noperates due to which the electron density on \northo and para positions of the benzene ring is slightly reduced. But the overall electron \ndensity increases at  these positions of the �ring due to resonance. Therefore, –OH group activates the benzene ring for the attack by Unit 9.indd   32410/10/2022   10:38:01 AM325an electrophile. Other examples of activating groups are –NH2, –NHR, –NHCOCH3, –OCH3,  –CH3, –C2H5, etc.In the case of aryl halides, halogens are moderately deactivating. Because of their  strong – I effect, overall electron density on \nbenzene ring decreases. It makes further \nsubstitution difficult. However, due to \nresonance the electron density on o– and p– positions is greater than that at the m-position. Hence, they are also o– and p– directing groups. Resonance structures of \nchlorobenzene are given below:In this case, the overall electron density on benzene ring decreases making further \nsubstitution difficult, therefore these groups \nare also called ‘deactivating groups’. The \nelectron density on o– and p– position is comparatively less than that at meta position. Hence, the electrophile attacks on \ncomparatively electron rich meta position \nresulting in meta substitution.9.6 CARCINOGENICITY AND TOXICITYBenzene and polynuclear hydrocarbons containing more than two benzene rings fused together are toxic and said to \npossess cancer producing (carcinogenic) \nproperty. Such polynuclear hydrocarbons \nare formed on incomplete combustion of \norganic materials like tobacco, coal and \npetroleum. They enter into human body \nand undergo various biochemical reactions \nand finally damage DNA and cause cancer. \nSome of the carcinogenic hydrocarbons are \ngiven below (see box).Meta directing group: The groups which direct the incoming group to meta position are called meta directing groups. Some examples of meta directing groups are –NO2, –CN, –CHO, –COR, –COOH, –COOR, –SO3H, etc.  Let us take the example of nitro group. Nitro group reduces the electron density in �the benzene ring due to its strong–I effect. \nNitrobenzene is a resonance hybrid of the \nfollowing structures.Unit 9.indd   32510/10/2022   10:38:01 AM326SUMMARYHydrocarbons are the compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons are mainly obtained from coal and petroleum, which are the major sources of energy. Petrochemicals are the prominent starting materials used for the manufacture of a large number of \ncommercially important products. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and  CNG (compressed \nnatural gas), the main sources of energy for domestic fuels and the automobile industry, are \nobtained from petroleum. Hydrocarbons are classified as open chain saturated (alkanes) and unsaturated (alkenes and alkynes), cyclic (alicyclic) and aromatic, according to their structure. The important reactions of alkanes are free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation and aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly electrophilic additions. Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo mainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under special conditions. Alkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C–C sigma bonds. Out of staggered and the eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation is more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical  (cis-trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon–carbon double bond. Benzene and benzenoid compounds show aromatic character. Aromaticity, the property of being aromatic is possessed by compounds having specific electronic structure \ncharacterised by Hückel (4n+2)π electron rule. The nature of groups or substituents attached to benzene ring is responsible for activation or deactivation of the benzene ring towards \nfurther electrophilic substitution and also for orientation of the incoming group. Some of \nthe polynuclear hydrocarbons having fused benzene ring system have carcinogenic property.

    "input": "235Chemistry deals with varieties of matter and change of one kind of matter into the other. Transformation of matter from one kind into another occurs through the \nvarious types of reactions. One important category of such \nreactions is Redox Reactions. A number of phenomena, \nboth physical as well as biological, are concerned with \nredox reactions. These reactions find extensive use in \npharmaceutical, biological, industrial, metallurgical and \nagricultural areas. The importance of these reactions is \napparent from the fact that burning of different types of \nfuels for obtaining energy for domestic, transport and \nother commercial purposes, electrochemical processes \nfor extraction of highly reactive metals and non-metals, \nmanufacturing of  chemical  compounds like  caustic \nsoda, operation of dry and wet batteries and corrosion of \nmetals fall within the purview of redox processes. Of late, \nenvironmental issues like Hydrogen Economy (use of liquid hydrogen as fuel) and development of ‘Ozone Hole’ have started figuring under redox phenomenon. 7.1\tCLASSICAL\tIDEA\tOF\tREDOX\tREACTIONS\t–\t\tOXIDATION AND REDUCTION REACTIONSOriginally, the term oxidation was used to describe the addition of oxygen to an element or a compound. Because of the presence of dioxygen in the atmosphere (~20%), \nmany elements combine with it and this is the principal \nreason why they commonly occur on the earth in the  form of their oxides. The following reactions represent \noxidation processes according to the limited definition of \noxidation: \n2 Mg (s)  +  O2 (g)  →  2 MgO (s) (7.1)S (s) + O2 (g)  →  SO2 (g) (7.2)After studying this unit you will be \nable to • identify redox reactions as a class of reactions in which oxidation and reduction reactions occur \nsimultaneously; • define the terms oxidation, \nreduction, oxidant (oxidising agent) and reductant (reducing \nagent); • explain mechanism of redox \nreactions by electron transfer process;• use  the concept of oxidation \nnumber to identify oxidant and \nreductant in a reaction;• classify redox reaction into combination (synthesis), \ndecomposition, displacement \nand disproportionation \nreactions; • suggest a comparative order \namong various reductants and \noxidants; • balance chemical equations using (i) oxidation number  (ii) half reaction method;• learn the concept of redox \nreactions in terms of electrode processes.UNIT 7REDOX REACTIONSWhere there is oxidation, there is always reduction –  Chemistry is essentially a study of redox systems.Unit 7.indd   23510/10/2022   10:37:02 AM236In reactions (7.1) and (7.2), the elements magnesium and sulphur are oxidised on account of addition of oxygen to them. \nSimilarly,  methane is oxidised owing to the \naddition of oxygen to it.CH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (l) (7.3)A careful examination of reaction (7.3) in which hydrogen has been replaced by oxygen prompted chemists to reinterpret oxidation \nin terms of removal of hydrogen from it and, \ntherefore, the scope of term oxidation was \nbroadened to include the removal of hydrogen \nfrom a substance. The following illustration is \nanother reaction where removal of hydrogen \ncan also be cited as an oxidation reaction. 2 H2S(g) + O2 (g) → 2 S (s) + 2 H2O (l) (7.4)As knowledge of chemists grew, it was natural to extend the term oxidation for reactions similar to (7.1 to 7.4), which do not involve oxygen but other electronegative \nelements. The oxidation of magnesium with \nfluorine, chlorine and sulphur etc. occurs \naccording to the following reactions : Mg (s) + F2 (g) → MgF2 (s) (7.5)Mg (s) + Cl2 (g) → MgCl2 (s) (7.6)Mg (s) + S (s) → MgS (s) (7.7)Incorporating the reactions (7.5 to 7.7) within the fold of oxidation reactions  encouraged chemists to consider not only the removal of hydrogen as oxidation, but \nalso the removal of electropositive elements \nas oxidation. Thus the reaction : 2K4 [Fe(CN)6](aq) + H2O2 (aq) →2K3[Fe(CN)6](aq) + 2 KOH (aq)is interpreted as oxidation due to the removal \nof electropositive element potassium from \npotassium ferrocyanide before it changes to \npotassium ferricyanide. To summarise, the \nterm “oxidation” is defined as the addition of oxygen/electronegative element to \na substance or removal of hydrogen/\nelectropositive element from a substance.In the beginning, reduction was considered as removal of oxygen from a compound. \nHowever, the term reduction has been broadened these days to include removal of oxygen/electronegative element from \na substance or addition of hydrogen/\nelectropositive element to a substance. According to the definition given above, the following are the examples of reduction \nprocesses:2 HgO (s)   2 Hg (l) + O2 (g) (7.8)(removal of oxygen from mercuric oxide )2 FeCl3 (aq) + H2 (g) →2 FeCl2 (aq) + 2 HCl(aq)(7.9)(removal of electronegative element, chlorine from ferric chloride)CH2 = CH2 (g) + H2 (g) → H3C – CH3 (g) (7.10)(addition of hydrogen)\n2HgCl2 (aq) + SnCl2 (aq) → Hg2Cl2 (s)+SnCl4 (aq)(7.11)(addition of mercury to mercuric chloride)In reaction (7.11) simultaneous oxidation of stannous chloride to stannic chloride is also occurring because of the addition of \nelectronegative element chlorine to it. It was \nsoon realised that oxidation and reduction \nalways occur simultaneously (as will be \napparent by re-examining all the equations \ngiven above), hence, the word “redox” was \ncoined for this class of chemical reactions. Problem 7.1In the reactions given below, identify the species undergoing oxidation and \nreduction: (i)  H2S (g) + Cl2 (g) → 2 HCl (g) + S (s)(ii) 3Fe3O4 (s) + 8 Al (s) → 9 Fe (s)                                                  + 4Al2O3 (s)(iii) 2 Na (s) + H2 (g) → 2 NaH (s)Solution  \n(i) H2S is oxidised because a more electronegative element, chlorine is added to hydrogen (or a more electropositive \nelement, hydrogen has been removed  from S). Chlorine is reduced due to \naddition of hydrogen to it.(ii)  Aluminium is oxidised because oxygen is added to it. Ferrous ferric oxide Unit 7.indd   23610/10/2022   10:37:03 AM237(Fe3O4) is reduced because oxygen has been removed from it. (iii)  With the careful application of the concept of electronegativity only we \nmay infer that sodium is oxidised and \nhydrogen is reduced. Reaction (iii) chosen here prompts us to think in terms of another way to define \nredox reactions. 7.2 REDOX REACTIONS IN TERMS OF \nELECTRON  TRANSFER REACTIONSWe have already learnt that the reactions 2Na(s) + Cl2(g) →  2NaCl (s) (7.12)4Na(s) + O2(g) →  2Na2O(s) (7.13)2Na(s) + S(s) →  Na2S(s) (7.14)are redox reactions because in each of these \nreactions sodium is oxidised due to the addition of either oxygen or more electronegative \nelement to sodium. Simultaneously, chlorine, \noxygen and sulphur are reduced because to \neach of these, the electropositive element \nsodium has been added. From our knowledge \nof chemical bonding we also know that sodium \nchloride, sodium oxide and sodium sulphide \nare ionic compounds and perhaps better \nwritten as Na+Cl– (s), (Na+)2O2–(s), and (Na+)2 S2–(s). Development of charges on the species produced suggests us to rewrite the reactions \n(7.12 to 7.14) in the following manner : For convenience, each of the above processes can be considered as two separate \nsteps, one involving the loss of electrons \nand the other the gain of electrons. As an \nillustration, we may further elaborate one of \nthese, say, the formation of  sodium chloride. 2 Na(s) → 2 Na+(g)   +   2e–Cl2(g) + 2e– → 2 Cl–(g)Each of the above steps is called a half reaction, which explicitly shows involvement of electrons. Sum of the half reactions gives \nthe overall reaction : 2 Na(s) + Cl2 (g)  → 2 Na+ Cl– (s) or 2 NaCl (s)Reactions 7.12 to 7.14 suggest that half reactions that involve loss of electrons are \ncalled oxidation reactions. Similarly, the \nhalf reactions that involve gain of electrons \nare called reduction reactions.  It may not \nbe out of context to mention here that the \nnew way of defining oxidation and reduction \nhas been achieved only by establishing a \ncorrelation between the behaviour of species \nas per the classical idea and their interplay \nin electron-transfer change. In reactions (7.12 \nto 7.14) sodium, which is oxidised, acts as  a reducing agent because it donates electron \nto each of the elements interacting with it and \nthus helps in reducing them. Chlorine, oxygen \nand sulphur are reduced and act as oxidising \nagents because these accept electrons from \nsodium. To summarise, we may mention that Oxidation : Loss of electron(s) by any species.\nReduction : Gain of electron(s) by any species.Oxidising agent : Acceptor of electron(s).\nReducing agent : Donor of electron(s).Problem 7.2  Justify that the reaction:\n2 Na(s) + H2(g) →  2 NaH (s) is a redox change.\nSolution\nSince in the above reaction the compound formed is an ionic compound, which may \nalso be represented as Na+H– (s), this suggests that one half reaction in this \nprocess is : 2 Na (s) → 2 Na+(g)  +   2e–Unit 7.indd   23710/10/2022   10:37:03 AM238and the other half reaction is: H2 (g) + 2e– →  2 H–(g)This splitting of the reaction under examination into two half reactions \nautomatically reveals that here sodium \nis oxidised and hydrogen is reduced, \ntherefore, the complete reaction is a \nredox change. 7.2.1 Competitive Electron Transfer \nReactionsPlace a strip of metallic zinc in an aqueous \nsolution of copper nitrate as shown in Fig. \n7.1, for about one hour. You may notice that the  strip becomes coated with reddish \nmetallic copper and the blue colour of the \nsolution disappears. Formation of  Zn2+ ions among the products can easily be  judged \nwhen the blue colour of the solution due to \nCu2+ has disappeared. If hydrogen sulphide gas is passed through the colourless solution \ncontaining Zn2+ ions, appearance of white zinc sulphide, ZnS can be seen on making the \nsolution alkaline with ammonia. The reaction between metallic zinc and the aqueous solution of copper nitrate is : Zn(s) + Cu2+ (aq) → Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)     (7.15)In reaction (7.15), zinc has lost electrons to form Zn2+ and, therefore, zinc is oxidised. Evidently, now if zinc is oxidised, releasing electrons, something must be reduced, \naccepting the electrons lost by zinc. Copper \nion is reduced by gaining electrons from the zinc. Reaction (7.15) may be rewritten as : At this stage we may investigate the state of equilibrium for the reaction represented by \nequation (7.15). For this purpose, let us place \na strip of metallic copper in a zinc sulphate \nsolution. No visible reaction is noticed and \nattempt to detect the presence of Cu2+ ions by passing H2S gas through the solution to produce the black colour of cupric sulphide, \nCuS, does not succeed. Cupric sulphide has \nsuch a low solubility that this is an extremely \nsensitive test; yet the amount of Cu2+ formed cannot be detected. We thus conclude that \nthe state of equilibrium for the reaction (7.15) \ngreatly favours the products over the reactants. Let us extend electron transfer reaction now to copper metal and silver nitrate solution \nin water and arrange a set-up as shown in  Fig. 7.2. The solution develops blue colour \ndue to the formation of Cu2+ ions on account of the reaction:Fig. 7.1  Redox reaction between zinc and aqueous solution of copper nitrate occurring in a beaker.(7.16)Here, Cu(s) is oxidised to Cu2+(aq) and  Ag+(aq) is reduced to Ag(s). Equilibrium greatly favours the products Cu2+ (aq) and Ag(s).By way of contrast, let us also compare the reaction of metallic cobalt placed in nickel \nsulphate solution. The reaction that occurs \nhere is : (7.17)Unit 7.indd   23811/11/2022   09:48:49239Fig. 7.2  Redox reaction between copper and aqueous solution of silver nitrate occurring in a beaker. At equilibrium, chemical tests reveal that both Ni2+(aq) and Co2+(aq)  are present at moderate concentrations. In this case, neither the \nreactants [Co(s) and Ni2+(aq)] nor the products [Co2+(aq) and Ni (s)] are greatly favoured. This competition for release of electrons incidently reminds us of the competition for \nrelease of  protons among acids.  The similarity \nsuggests that we might develop a table in \nwhich metals and their ions are listed  on the \nbasis of their tendency to release electrons \njust as we do in the case of acids to indicate \nthe strength of the acids. As a matter of fact \nwe have already made certain comparisons. \nBy comparison we have come to know that \nzinc releases electrons to copper and copper \nreleases electrons to silver and, therefore, \nthe electron releasing tendency of the metals \nis in the order: Zn\u003eCu\u003eAg. We would love to \nmake our list more vast and design a metal \nactivity series or electrochemical series. \nThe competition for electrons between various \nmetals helps us to design a class of cells, \nnamed as Galvanic cells in which the chemical \nreactions become the source of electrical \nenergy. We would study more about these \ncells in Class XII.7.3 OXIDATION NUMBERA less obvious example of electron transfer is realised when hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water by the reaction:2H2(g) + O2 (g) →  2H2O (l)      (7.18)Though not simple in its approach, yet we can visualise the H atom as going from a neutral (zero) state in H2 to a positive state in H2O, the O atom goes from a zero state in O2 to a dinegative state in H2O. It is assumed that there is an electron transfer from H to O and consequently H2 is oxidised and O2 is reduced. However, as we shall see later, the charge transfer is only partial and is perhaps better \ndescribed as an electron shift rather than a \ncomplete loss of electron by H and gain by \nO. What has been said here with respect \nto equation (7.18) may be true for a good \nnumber of other reactions involving covalent \ncompounds. Two such examples of this class \nof the reactions are:H2(s) + Cl2(g)   →  2HCl(g)     (7.19)and,\nCH 4(g)  +  4Cl2(g)  → CCl4(l)  + 4HCl(g)    (7.20)In order to keep track of electron shifts in chemical reactions involving formation of covalent compounds, a more practical \nmethod of using oxidation number has \nbeen developed. In this method, it is always \nassumed that there is a complete transfer \nof electron from a less electronegative atom \nto a more electonegative atom. For example, \nwe rewrite equations (7.18 to 7.20) to show \ncharge on each of the atoms forming part of \nthe reaction :   0           0              +1 –22H2(g) + O2(g) →  2H2O (l) (7.21)0            0            +1 –1H2 (s) + Cl2(g) →  2HCl(g) (7.22)–4+1          0          +4 –1        +1 –1 CH4(g)  + 4Cl2(g) →  CCl4(l)  +4HCl(g) (7.23)It may be emphasised that the assumption of electron transfer is made for book-keeping \npurpose only and it will become obvious at \na later stage in this unit that it leads to the simple description of redox reactions. Oxidation number denotes the oxidation state of an element in a compound \nascertained according to a set of rules \nformulated on the basis that electron pair Unit 7.indd   23911/10/2022   15:18:03240in a covalent bond belongs entirely to more electronegative element. It is not always possible to remember or make out easily in a compound/ion, which \nelement is more electronegative than the \nother. Therefore, a set of rules has been \nformulated to determine the oxidation \nnumber of an element in a compound/ion. \nIf two or more than two atoms of an element \nare present in the molecule/ion such as \nNa2S2O3/Cr2O7 2–, the oxidation number of the atom of that element will then be the average \nof the oxidation number of all the atoms of \nthat element. We may at this stage, state the \nrules for the calculation of oxidation number. \nThese rules are: 1. In elements, in the free or the uncombined state, each atom bears an oxidation \nnumber of zero. Evidently each atom in H2, O2, Cl2, O3, P4, S8, Na, Mg, Al has the oxidation number zero. 2. For ions composed of only one atom, the \noxidation number is equal to the charge \non the ion. Thus Na+ ion has an oxidation number of +1, Mg2+ ion, +2, Fe3+ ion, +3, Cl– ion, –1, O2– ion, –2; and so on. In their compounds all alkali metals have oxidation \nnumber of +1, and all alkaline earth metals \nhave an oxidation number of +2. Aluminium \nis regarded to have an oxidation number of \n+3 in all its compounds. 3. The oxidation number of oxygen in most compounds is –2. However, we come across two kinds of exceptions here. \nOne arises in the case of peroxides and \nsuperoxides, the compounds of oxygen in \nwhich oxygen atoms are directly linked to \neach other. While in peroxides (e.g., H2O2, Na2O2), each oxygen atom is assigned an oxidation number of –1, in superoxides \n(e.g., KO2, RbO2) each oxygen atom is assigned an oxidation number of –(½). \nThe second exception appears rarely, i.e. \nwhen oxygen is bonded to fluorine. In \nsuch compounds e.g., oxygen difluoride \n(OF2) and dioxygen difluoride (O2F2), the oxygen is assigned an oxidation number \nof +2 and +1, respectively. The number \nassigned to oxygen will depend upon the bonding state of oxygen but this number would now be a positive figure only. 4. The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1, \nexcept when it is bonded to metals in binary \ncompounds (that is compounds containing two elements). For example, in LiH, NaH, \nand CaH2, its oxidation number is –1. 5. In all its compounds, fluorine has an �oxidation number of –1. Other halogens (Cl, Br, and I) also have an oxidation number �of –1, when they occur as halide ions in \ntheir compounds. Chlorine, bromine and \niodine when combined with oxygen, for \nexample in oxoacids and oxoanions, have \npositive oxidation numbers. 6. The algebraic sum of the oxidation number \nof all the atoms in a compound must be \nzero. In polyatomic ion, the algebraic sum of all the oxidation numbers of atoms of \nthe ion must equal the charge on the ion. \nThus, the sum of oxidation number of three \noxygen atoms and one carbon atom in the \ncarbonate ion, (CO3)2– must equal –2. By the application of above rules, we can find out the oxidation number of the desired \nelement in a molecule or in an ion. It is clear \nthat the metallic elements have positive \noxidation number and nonmetallic elements \nhave positive or negative oxidation number. \nThe atoms of transition elements usually \ndisplay several positive oxidation states. The \nhighest oxidation number of a representative \nelement is the group number for the first \ntwo groups and the group number minus 10 \n(following the long form of periodic table) for \nthe other groups. Thus, it implies that the \nhighest value of oxidation number exhibited \nby an atom of an element generally increases \nacross the period in the periodic table. In the \nthird period, the highest value of oxidation \nnumber changes from 1 to 7 as indicated \nbelow in the compounds of the elements.A term that is often used interchangeably with the oxidation number is the oxidation \nstate. Thus in CO2, the oxidation state of carbon is +4, that is also its oxidation number \nand similarly the oxidation state as well �as oxidation number of oxygen is – 2. This \nimplies that the oxidation number denotes the oxidation state of an element in a compound. Unit 7.indd   24010/10/2022   10:37:04 AM241The oxidation number/state of a metal in a compound is sometimes presented according \nto the notation given by German chemist, \nAlfred Stock. It is popularly known as Stock \nnotation. According to this, the oxidation number is expressed by putting a Roman \nnumeral representing the oxidation number \nin parenthesis after the symbol of the metal in \nthe molecular formula. Thus aurous chloride \nand auric chloride are written as Au(I)Cl and \nAu(III)Cl3. Similarly, stannous chloride and stannic chloride are written as Sn(II)Cl2 and Sn(IV)Cl4. This change in oxidation number implies change in oxidation state, which in \nturn helps to identify whether the species \nis present in oxidised form or reduced form. Thus, Hg2(I)Cl2 is the reduced form of Hg(II) Cl2. Problem 7.3Using Stock notation, represent the following compounds :HAuCl4, Tl2O, FeO,   Fe2O3, CuI, CuO, MnO and MnO2.    Solution By applying various rules of calculating the oxidation number of the desired \nelement in a compound, the oxidation \nnumber of each metallic element in its \ncompound is as follows:HAuCl4  → Au has 3Tl2O → Tl has 1FeO → Fe has 2Fe2O3 → Fe has 3 CuI → Cu has 1CuO → Cu has 2MnO → Mn has 2MnO2 → Mn has 4Therefore, these compounds may be represented as:HAu(III)Cl4, Tl2(I)O, Fe(II)O, Fe2(III)O3, Cu(I)I, Cu(II)O, Mn(II)O, Mn(IV)O2.The idea of oxidation number has been invariably applied to define oxidation, \nreduction, oxidising agent (oxidant), reducing \nagent (reductant) and the redox reaction. To \nsummarise, we may say that:Oxidation: An increase in the oxidation number of the element in the given substance. Reduction  : A decrease in the oxidation number of the element in the given substance.\nOxidising agent: A reagent which can increase the oxidation number of an element in a given substance. These reagents are \ncalled as oxidants also.Reducing agent: A reagent which lowers the oxidation number of an element in a given substance. These reagents are also called as \nreductants.Redox reactions: Reactions which involve change in oxidation number of the interacting species.Problem 7.4Justify that the reaction:\n2Cu2O(s) + Cu2S(s)  →   6Cu(s) + SO2(g)is a redox reaction. Identify the species oxidised/reduced, which acts as an \noxidant and which acts as a reductant.SolutionLet us assign oxidation number to each of the species in the reaction under \nexamination. This results into:  +1  –2        +1  –2          0        +4 –22Cu2O(s) + Cu2S(s)  →  6Cu(s) + SO2We therefore, conclude that in this \nreaction copper is reduced from  +1 state to zero oxidation state and sulphur is \noxidised from –2 state to +4 state. The \nabove reaction is thus a redox reaction.

Combination reactions A combination reaction may be denoted in the manner:A + B  →   CEither A and B or both A and B must be in \nthe elemental form for such a reaction to be \na redox reaction. All combustion reactions, \nwhich make use of elemental dioxygen, as well \nas other reactions involving elements other \nthan dioxygen, are redox reactions. Some \nimportant examples of this category are:0           0              +4 –2C(s)  +  O2 (g)      CO2(g) (7.24)   0       0       +2  –33Mg(s) + N2(g)    Mg3N2(s) (7.25)–4+1           0            +4 –2               +1 –2CH4(g)  +  2O2(g)  CO2(g)   +    2H2O (l)2. Decomposition reactions Decomposition reactions are the opposite of combination reactions. Precisely, a \ndecomposition reaction leads to the breakdown \nof a compound into two or more components \nat least one of which must be in the elemental \nstate. Examples of this class of reactions are:+1 –2         0           02H2O (l)    2H2 (g) + O2(g) (7.26)+1 –1                    0            02NaH (s)     2Na (s) + H2(g) (7.27)+1 +5 –2                 +1 –1           02KClO3 (s)     2KCl (s)  + 3O2(g) (7.28)It may carefully be noted that there is no change in the oxidation number of hydrogen in methane under combination reactions \nand that of potassium in potassium chlorate \nin reaction (7.28). This may also be noted here that all decomposition reactions are not redox reactions. For example, decomposition of calcium carbonate is not a redox reaction.+2 +4 –2  +2 –2           +4 –2CaCO3 (s)      CaO(s)    +    CO2(g) 3. Displacement reactions In a displacement reaction, an ion (or an atom) in a compound is replaced by an ion (or an atom) of another element. It may be \ndenoted as: X  + YZ  →  XZ  + Y Displacement reactions fit into two \ncategories: metal displacement and non-metal \ndisplacement.(a) Metal displacement: A metal in a compound can be displaced by another metal in the uncombined state. We have already \ndiscussed about this class of the reactions \nunder section 7.2.1. Metal displacement \nreactions find many applications in \nmetallurgical processes in which pure metals \nare obtained from their compounds in ores. A \nfew such examples are:+2+6–2     0   0        +2 +6 –2CuSO4(aq) + Zn (s) → Cu(s) + ZnSO4 (aq)              (7.29)+5 –2            0   0      +2 –2V2O5 (s) + 5Ca (s)    2V (s) + 5CaO (s)            (7.30)+4 –1           0         0             +2 –1TiCl4 (l) + 2Mg (s)   Ti (s) + 2 MgCl2 (s)           (7.31)+3 –2              0            +3 –2             0Cr2O3 (s) + 2 Al (s)   Al2O3 (s) + 2Cr(s)             (7.32)In each case, the reducing metal is a better reducing agent than the one that is \nbeing reduced which evidently shows more \ncapability to lose electrons as compared to \nthe one that is reduced.(b) Non-metal displacement: The non-metal displacement redox reactions include \nhydrogen displacement and a rarely occurring \nreaction involving oxygen displacement.Unit 7.indd   24210/10/2022   10:37:04 AM243All alkali metals and some alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr, and Ba) which are very good reductants, will displace hydrogen from cold \nwater.   0          +1 –2               +1 –2 +1          02Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g)(7.33)  0         +1 –2             +2 –2 +1            0Ca(s)  +  2H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2 (aq) + H2(g) (7.34)Less active metals such as magnesium and iron react with steam to produce dihydrogen gas: 0         +1 –2             +2 –2 +1  0 Mg(s)  +  2H2O(l)    Mg(OH)2(s) + H2(g)             (7.35)  0         +1 –2            +3 –2            02Fe(s) + 3H2O(l)     Fe2O3(s) + 3H2(g)   (7.36)Many metals, including those which do not react with cold water, are capable of displacing hydrogen from acids. Dihydrogen from acids \nmay even be produced by such metals which \ndo not react with steam. Cadmium and tin are \nthe examples of such metals. A few examples \nfor the displacement of hydrogen from acids \nare:  0         +1 –1  +2 –1           0Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq)  →  ZnCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)           (7.37) 0           +1 –1          +2 –1             0Mg (s) + 2HCl (aq)  →  MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)           (7.38) 0     +1 –1       +2 –1           0Fe(s) + 2HCl(aq)  →  FeCl2(aq) + H2(g)            (7.39)Reactions (7.37 to 7.39) are used to prepare dihydrogen gas in the laboratory. Here, the reactivity of metals is reflected in \nthe rate of hydrogen gas evolution, which is \nthe slowest for the least active metal Fe, and \nthe fastest for the most reactive metal, Mg. \nVery less active metals, which may occur in \nthe native state such as silver (Ag), and gold \n(Au) do not react even with hydrochloric acid.In section (7.2.1) we have already discussed that the metals – zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and \nsilver (Ag) through tendency to lose electrons \nshow their reducing activity in the order Zn\u003e Cu\u003eAg. Like metals, activity series also exists for the halogens. The power of these elements \nas oxidising agents decreases as we move \ndown from fluorine to iodine in group 17 of the \nperiodic table. This implies that fluorine is so \nreactive that it can replace chloride, bromide \nand iodide ions in solution. In fact, fluorine is \nso reactive that it attacks water and displaces \nthe oxygen of water :  +1 –2           0        +1 –1        02H2O (l) + 2F2 (g)  → 4HF(aq)  + O2(g)     (7.40)It is for this reason that the displacement reactions of chlorine, bromine and iodine \nusing fluorine are not generally carried out in \naqueous solution. On the other hand, chlorine \ncan displace bromide and iodide ions in an \naqueous solution as shown below:  0     +1 –1          +1 –1           0Cl2 (g) + 2KBr (aq)  → 2 KCl (aq) + Br2 (l)            (7.41) 0     +1–1         +1 –1            0Cl2 (g) + 2KI (aq)  →  2 KCl (aq)  +  I2 (s)      (7.42)As Br2 and I2 are coloured and dissolve in CCl4, can easily be identified from the colour of the \nsolution. The above reactions can be written \nin ionic form as:   0       –1         –1           0Cl2 (g) + 2Br– (aq) → 2Cl– (aq) + Br2 (l)  (7.41a) 0            –1                      –1            0Cl2 (g) + 2I– (aq)  →  2Cl– (aq) + I2 (s)    (7.42b)Reactions (7.41) and (7.42) form the basis of identifying Br– and I– in the laboratory through the test popularly known as ‘Layer Test’. It may not be out of place to mention \nhere that bromine likewise can displace iodide \nion in solution: 0      –1                –1            0Br2 (l)  + 2I – (aq) → 2Br– (aq) + I2 (s)       (7.43)The halogen displacement reactions have a direct industrial application. The recovery of halogens from their halides requires an oxidation process, which is represented by: 2X–  →   X2   +  2e–         (7.44)here X denotes a halogen element. Whereas chemical means are available to oxidise Cl–, Br– and I–, as fluorine is the strongest oxidising Unit 7.indd   24310/10/2022   10:37:04 AM244agent; there is no way to convert F– ions to F2 by chemical means. The only way to achieve F2 from F– is to oxidise electrolytically, the details of which you will study at a later stage. 4. Disproportionation reactions  \nDisproportionation reactions are a special type of redox reactions. In a disproportionation \nreaction an element in one oxidation state \nis simultaneously oxidised and reduced.  One of the reacting substances in a \ndisproportionation reaction always contains \nan element that can exist in at least three \noxidation states. The element in the form \nof reacting substance is in the intermediate \noxidation state; and both higher and lower \noxidation states of that element are formed in \nthe reaction. The decomposition of hydrogen \nperoxide is a familiar example of the reaction, \nwhere oxygen experiences disproportionation.+1 –1                 +1  –2        02H2O2 (aq)  →  2H2O(l) +  O2(g)       (7.45)Here the oxygen of peroxide, which is present in –1 state, is converted to zero oxidation state \nin O2 and decreases to –2 oxidation state in H2O. Phosphorous, sulphur and chlorine undergo disproportionation in the alkaline \nmedium as shown below : 0                                          –3                 +1P4(s) + 3OH–(aq)+ 3H2O(l) → PH3(g) + 3H2PO2–   (aq)   (7.46)0                     –2                +2 S8(s) + 12 OH– (aq) →  4S2– (aq) + 2S2O32–(aq)  + 6H2O(l)   (7.47)0               +1               –1Cl2 (g) + 2 OH– (aq)  →     ClO– (aq) + Cl– (aq) + H2O (l)   (7.48)The reaction (7.48) describes the formation of household bleaching agents. \nThe hypochlorite ion (ClO–) formed in the reaction oxidises the colour-bearing stains \nof the substances to colourless compounds. It is of interest to mention here that whereas bromine and iodine follow the same trend \nas exhibited by chlorine in reaction (7.48),  fluorine shows deviation from this behaviour \nwhen it reacts with alkali. The reaction that \ntakes place in the case of fluorine is as follows: 2 F2(g) + 2OH–(aq) → 2 F–(aq) + OF2(g) + H2O(l)  (7.49)(It is to be noted with care that fluorine in reaction (7.49) will undoubtedly attack water to produce some oxygen also). This departure \nshown by fluorine is not surprising for us as \nwe know the limitation of fluorine that, being \nthe most electronegative element, it cannot \nexhibit any positive oxidation state. This \nmeans that among halogens, fluorine does not \nshow a disproportionation tendency. Problem 7.5 Which of the following species, do not show disproportionation reaction and \nwhy ? ClO–, ClO2–, ClO3– and ClO4 –Also write reaction for each of the species that disproportionates. Solution \nAmong the oxoanions of chlorine listed above, ClO4– does not disproportionate because in this oxoanion chlorine is \npresent in its highest oxidation state that \nis, +7. The disproportionation reactions \nfor the other three oxoanions of chlorine \nare as follows:  +1     –1        +53ClO– → 2Cl– + ClO–3   +3    +5            –16 ClO2–    4ClO3–  +  2Cl–  +5  –1           +74ClO–3 → Cl–  +   3 ClO4–Problem 7.6      \nSuggest a scheme of classification of the following redox reactions(a) N2 (g) + O2 (g)  → 2 NO (g)(b) 2Pb(NO3)2(s)  → 2PbO(s) + 4 NO2 (g) +      O2 (g)(c) NaH(s) + H2O(l) → NaOH(aq) + H2 (g)(d) 2NO2(g) + 2OH–(aq) →  NO2–(aq) +                                           NO3– (aq)+H2O(l)Unit 7.indd   24411/10/2022   15:18:43245SolutionIn reaction (a), the compound nitric oxide is formed by the combination of \nthe elemental substances, nitrogen and \noxygen; therefore, this is an example \nof combination redox reactions. The \nreaction (b) involves the breaking down \nof lead nitrate into three components; \ntherefore, this is categorised under decomposition redox reaction. In The Paradox of Fractional Oxidation NumberSometimes, we come across with certain compounds in which the oxidation number of a particular \nelement in the compound is in fraction. Examples are:C3O2 [where oxidation number of carbon  is (4/3)], Br3O8 [where oxidation number of bromine is (16/3)] and Na2S4O6 (where oxidation number of sulphur is 2.5).We know that the idea of fractional oxidation number is unconvincing to us, because electrons are never shared/transferred in fraction. Actually this fractional oxidation state is the average oxidation state of the element under examination and the structural parameters reveal that the \nelement for whom fractional oxidation state is realised is present in different oxidation states. \nStructure of the species C3O2, Br3O8 and S4O62– reveal  the following bonding situations:                                             +2    0    +2O = C = C*= C = OStructure of C3O2 (carbon suboxide)    Structure of Br3O8  (tribromooctaoxide)   Structure of S4O62– (tetrathionate ion) The element marked with asterisk in each species is exhibiting the different oxidation state (oxidation number) from rest of the atoms  of the same element in each of the species. \nThis reveals that in C3O2, two carbon atoms are present in +2 oxidation state each, whereas the third one is present in zero oxidation state and the average is 4/3. However, the realistic \npicture is +2 for two terminal carbons and zero for the middle carbon. Likewise in Br3O8, each of the two terminal bromine atoms are present in +6 oxidation state and the middle bromine \nis present in +4 oxidation state. Once again the average, that is different from reality, is  16/3. In the same fashion, in the species S4O62–, each of the two extreme sulphurs exhibits oxidation state of +5 and the two middle sulphurs as zero. The average of four  oxidation numbers of sulphurs \nof the S4O62– is 2.5, whereas the reality being + 5,0,0 and +5 oxidation number respectively for each sulphur.We may thus, in general, conclude that the idea of fractional oxidation state should be taken with care and the reality is revealed by the structures only. Further, whenever we come across \nwith fractional oxidation state of any particular element in any species, we must understand that \nthis is the average oxidation number only. In reality (revealed by structures only), the element in \nthat particular species is present in more than one whole number oxidation states. Fe3O4, Mn3O4, Pb3O4 are some of the other examples of the compounds, which are mixed oxides, where we come across with fractional oxidation states of the metal atom. However, the oxidation states may be in \nfraction as in O2+ and O2– where it is +½ and –½ respectively.reaction (c), hydrogen of water has been displaced by hydride ion into dihydrogen \ngas. Therefore, this may be called as \ndisplacement redox reaction. The reaction \n(d) involves disproportionation of NO2  (+4 state)  into NO2– (+3 state) and NO3– (+5 state). Therefore reaction (d) is an \nexample of disproportionation redox \nreaction.Unit 7.indd   24510/10/2022   10:37:04 AM246Problem 7.8Write the net ionic equation for the reaction of potassium dichromate(VI), \nK2Cr2O7 with sodium sulphite, Na2SO3, in an acid solution to give chromium(III) \nion and the sulphate  ion. Problem 7.7Why do the following reactions proceed differently ?Pb3O4 + 8HCl → 3PbCl2 + Cl2 + 4H2O   andPb3O4 + 4HNO3 → 2Pb(NO3)2 + PbO2 +                                   2H2OSolution\nPb3O4  is actually a stoichiometric mixture of 2 mol of PbO and 1 mol of PbO2. In PbO2, lead is present in +4 oxidation state, whereas the stable \noxidation state of lead in PbO is +2. PbO2 thus can act as an oxidant (oxidising \nagent) and, therefore, can oxidise Cl– ion of HCl into chlorine. We may also keep in \nmind that PbO is a basic oxide. Therefore, \nthe reactionPb3O4 + 8HCl → 3PbCl2 + Cl2 + 4H2O  can be splitted into two reactions namely:\n2PbO + 4HCl → 2PbCl2 + 2H2O     (acid-base reaction)+4              –1              +2          0PbO2 + 4HCl →  PbCl2 + Cl2 +2H2O    (redox reaction)Since HNO3 itself is an oxidising agent therefore, it is unlikely that the reaction may occur between PbO2 and HNO3. However, the acid-base reaction occurs \nbetween PbO and HNO3 as:2PbO + 4HNO3 → 2Pb(NO3)2 + 2H2OIt is the passive nature of PbO2 against HNO3 that makes the reaction different from the one that follows with HCl.(a) Oxidation Number Method: In writing equations for oxidation-reduction reactions, just as for other reactions, the compositions and \nformulas must be known for the substances \nthat react and for the products that are \nformed. The oxidation number method is now \nbest illustrated in the following steps:Step 1: Write the correct formula for each reactant and product.Step 2: Identify atoms which undergo change in oxidation number in the reaction \nby assigning the oxidation number to all \nelements in the reaction.Step 3: Calculate the increase or decrease in the oxidation number per atom and for \nthe entire molecule/ion in which it occurs. If \nthese are not equal then multiply by suitable \nnumber so that these become equal. (If you \nrealise that two substances are reduced and \nnothing is oxidised or vice-versa, something \nis wrong. Either the formulas of reactants or \nproducts are wrong or the oxidation numbers \nhave not been assigned properly).Step 4: Ascertain the involvement of ions if the reaction is taking place in water, add H+ or OH– ions to the expression on the appropriate side so that the total ionic charges of reactants \nand products are equal. If the reaction is \ncarried out in acidic solution, use H+ ions in the equation; if in basic solution, use OH– ions. Step 5 :  Make the numbers of hydrogen atoms in the expression on the two sides \nequal by adding water (H2O) molecules to the reactants or products. Now, also check the \nnumber of oxygen atoms. If there are the same \nnumber of oxygen atoms in the reactants and \nproducts, the equation then represents the \nbalanced redox reaction. Let us now explain the steps involved in the method with the help of a few problems given below: 7.3.2 Balancing of Redox ReactionsTwo methods are used to balance chemical equations for redox processes. One of these \nmethods is based on the change in the oxidation number of reducing agent and the \noxidising agent and the other method is based \non splitting the redox reaction into two half \nreactions — one involving oxidation and the \nother involving reduction. Both these methods \nare in use and the choice of their use rests \nwith the individual using them.Unit 7.indd   24610/10/2022   10:37:04 AM247Solution Step 1: The skeletal ionic equation is: \nCr2O72–(aq) + SO32–(aq) → Cr3+(aq)  + SO42–(aq)Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers for Cr and S+6  –2            +4 –2             +3          +6 –2Cr2O72–(aq) + SO32–(aq) → Cr(aq)+SO42–(aq)This indicates that the dichromate ion is \nthe oxidant and the sulphite ion is the \nreductant.Step 3: Calculate the increase and decrease of oxidation number, and make \nthem equal: from step-2 we can notice \nthat there is change in oxidation state \nof chromium and sulphur. Oxidation \nstate of chromium changes form +6 to \n+3. There is decrease of +3 in oxidation \nstate of chromium on right hand side of \nthe equation. Oxidation state of sulphur \nchanges from +4 to +6. There is an increase \nof +2 in the oxidation state of sulphur on \nright hand side. To make the increase and \ndecrease of oxidation state equal, place \nnumeral 2 before cromium ion on right \nhand side and numeral 3 before sulphate \nion on right hand side and balance the \nchromium and sulphur atoms on both the \nsides of  the equation. Thus we get+6 –2                +4 –2               +3        Cr2O72–(aq) + 3SO32– (aq)  → 2Cr3+ (aq) +         +6 –23SO42– (aq)Step 4: As the reaction occurs in the \nacidic medium, and further the ionic \ncharges are not equal on both the sides, \nadd 8H+ on the left to make ionic charges equal Cr2O72–(aq) + 3SO32–(aq)+ 8H+→ 2Cr3+(aq)   + 3SO42– (aq)Step 5: Finally, count the hydrogen atoms, and add appropriate number of \nwater molecules (i.e., 4H2O) on the right to achieve balanced redox change. Cr2O72– (aq) + 3SO32– (aq)+ 8H+ (aq) →  2Cr3+ (aq) + 3SO42– (aq) +4H2O (l)Problem 7.9  Permanganate ion reacts with bromide ion in basic medium to give manganese \ndioxide and bromate ion. Write the balanced ionic equation for the reaction. Solution Step 1: The skeletal ionic equation is : \nMnO4–(aq) + Br–(aq) → MnO2(s) + BrO3– (aq)Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers for Mn and Br+7            –1     +4            +5MnO4–(aq) + Br–(aq) →MnO2 (s) + BrO3– (aq)this indicates that permanganate ion \nis the oxidant and bromide ion is the \nreductant. Step 3: Calculate the increase and decrease of oxidation number, and make the increase equal to the decrease.   +7             –1       +4            +5  2MnO4–(aq)+Br –(aq) → 2MnO2(s)+BrO3–(aq)Step 4: As the reaction occurs in the basic medium, and the ionic charges are \nnot equal on both sides, add 2 OH– ions on the right to make ionic charges equal. 2MnO4– (aq) + Br– (aq) → 2MnO2(s) +  BrO3–(aq) + 2OH–(aq)Step 5: Finally, count the hydrogen atoms and add appropriate number of water \nmolecules (i.e. one H2O molecule) on the left side to achieve balanced redox change. 2MnO4–(aq) + Br–(aq) + H2O(l) → 2MnO2(s)             + BrO3– (aq) + 2OH–(aq)(b) Half Reaction Method: In this method, the two half equations are balanced separately and then added together to give balanced \nequation. Suppose we are to balance the equation showing the oxidation of Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions by dichromate ions (Cr2O7)2– in acidic medium, wherein, Cr2O72– ions are reduced to Cr3+ ions. The following steps are involved in this task. Step 1: Produce unbalanced equation for the reaction in ionic form : Fe2+(aq) + Cr2O72– (aq) →  Fe3+ (aq) + Cr3+(aq)   (7.50)Unit 7.indd   24710/10/2022   10:37:05 AM248Step 2: Separate the equation into half-reactions:    +2          +3  Oxidation half : Fe2+ (aq) →  Fe3+(aq)      (7.51)   +6 –2      +3Reduction half : Cr2O72–(aq) →  Cr3+(aq)   (7.52)Step 3: Balance the atoms other than O and H in each half reaction individually. Here the oxidation half reaction is already balanced with respect to Fe atoms. For the reduction \nhalf reaction, we multiply the Cr3+ by 2 to balance Cr atoms.Cr2O7 2–(aq)  →  2 Cr3+(aq) (7.53)Step 4: For reactions occurring in acidic medium, add H2O to balance O atoms and H+ to balance H atoms. Thus, we get :Cr2O7 2– (aq) + 14H+ (aq) → 2 Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O (l) (7.54)Step 5: Add electrons to one side of the half reaction to balance the charges. If need be, make the number of electrons equal in the two half reactions by multiplying one or both half reactions by appropriate number. The oxidation half reaction is thus rewritten to balance the charge: Fe2+ (aq)  →  Fe3+ (aq)  + e– (7.55)Now in the reduction half reaction there are net twelve positive charges on the left hand side and only six positive charges on the right hand side. Therefore, we add six electrons on \nthe left side. Cr2O7 2– (aq) + 14H+ (aq) + 6e– → 2Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O (l) (7.56)To equalise the number of electrons in both the half reactions, we multiply the oxidation half reaction by 6 and write as : 6Fe2+ (aq) → 6Fe3+(aq)  + 6e–        (7.57)Step 6: We add the two half reactions to achieve the overall reaction and cancel the electrons on each side. This gives the net ionic equation as : 6Fe2+(aq) + Cr2O72–(aq) + 14H+(aq) → 6 Fe3+(aq) + 2Cr 3+(aq) + 7H2O(l)  (7.58)Step 7: Verify that the equation contains the same type and number of atoms and the same \ncharges on both sides of the equation. This \nlast check reveals that the equation is fully \nbalanced with respect to number of atoms and the charges. For the reaction in a basic medium, first balance the atoms as is done in acidic medium. Then for each H+ ion, add an equal number of OH– ions to both sides of the equation. Where H+ and OH– appear on the same side of the equation, combine these to give H2O. Problem 7.10Permanganate(VII) ion, MnO4– in basic solution oxidises iodide ion, I– to produce molecular iodine (I2) and manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2). Write a balanced ionic equation to represent this redox reaction. \nSolution\nStep 1: First we write the skeletal ionic equation, which is \nMnO4– (aq) + I– (aq) → MnO2(s) + I2(s)Step 2: The two half-reactions are:            –1                 0Oxidation half :  I–(aq)   →   I2 (s)         +7           +4Reduction half:  MnO4–(aq) →  MnO2(s)Step 3: To balance the I atoms in the oxidation half reaction, we  rewrite it as:   2I– (aq) → I2 (s)Step 4: To balance the O atoms in the \nreduction half reaction, we add two water \nmolecules on the right: MnO4– (aq) → MnO2 (s) + 2 H2O (l)To balance the H atoms, we add four H+ ions on the left: \nMnO4 – (aq) + 4 H+ (aq) → MnO2(s) + 2H2O (l)As the reaction takes place in a basic solution, therefore, for four H+ ions, we add four OH– ions to both sides of the equation: MnO4– (aq) + 4H+ (aq) + 4OH–(aq)  →  MnO2 (s) + 2 H2O(l)  + 4OH– (aq)Replacing the H+ and OH– ions with water, Unit 7.indd   24810/10/2022   10:37:05 AM249the resultant equation is: MnO4– (aq) + 2H2O (l) → MnO2 (s) + 4 OH– (aq)Step 5 : In this step we balance the charges of the two half-reactions in the manner depicted as:  2I– (aq) → I2 (s) + 2e–MnO4–(aq) + 2H2O(l) + 3e– → MnO2(s)  + 4OH–(aq)Now to equalise the number of electrons, \nwe multiply the oxidation half-reaction by \n3 and the reduction half-reaction by 2. 6I–(aq) → 3I2 (s) + 6e–2 MnO4– (aq) + 4H2O (l) +6e– → 2MnO2(s)   + 8OH– (aq)Step 6: Add two half-reactions to obtain the net reactions after cancelling \nelectrons on both sides. 6I–(aq) + 2MnO4–(aq) + 4H2O(l) → 3I2(s) +  2MnO2(s) +8 OH–(aq)Step 7: A final verification shows that the equation is balanced in respect of \nthe number of atoms and charges on \nboth sides. 7.3.3 Redox Reactions as the Basis  for \nTitrations In acid-base systems we come across with a titration method for finding out the strength \nof one solution against the other using a pH sensitive indicator. Similarly, in redox \nsystems, the titration method can be adopted \nto determine the strength of a reductant/\noxidant using a redox sensitive indicator. \nThe usage of indicators in redox titration is \nillustrated below:(i) In one situation, the reagent itself is intensely coloured, e.g., permanganate ion, MnO4–. Here MnO4– acts as the self indicator. The visible end point in this case \nis achieved after the last of the reductant \n(Fe2+ or C2O42–) is oxidised and the first lasting tinge of pink colour appears at \nMnO4– concentration as low as 10–6 mol dm–3  (10–6 mol L–1). This ensures a minimal ‘overshoot’ in colour beyond the equivalence \npoint, the point where the reductant and \nthe oxidant are equal in terms of their \nmole stoichiometry.(ii) If there is no dramatic auto-colour change (as with MnO4– titration), there are indicators which are oxidised immediately after the last bit of the reactant is consumed, \nproducing a dramatic colour change. The \nbest example is afforded by Cr2O72–, which is not a self-indicator, but oxidises the \nindicator substance diphenylamine just \nafter the equivalence point to produce an \nintense blue colour, thus signalling the \nend point. (iii) There is yet another method which is \ninteresting and quite common. Its use is \nrestricted to those reagents which are able to oxidise I– ions, say, for example, Cu(II): 2Cu2+(aq) + 4I–(aq) → Cu2I2(s) + I2(aq)  (7.59)This method relies on the facts that iodine itself gives an intense blue colour with \nstarch and has a very specific reaction with \nthiosulphate ions (S2O32–), which too is a redox reaction: I2(aq) + 2 S2O32–(aq)→2I–(aq) + S4O62–(aq) (7.60)I2, though insoluble in water, remains in solution containing KI as KI3.On addition of starch after the liberation of iodine from the reaction of Cu2+ ions on iodide ions, an intense blue colour appears. This colour disappears as soon as the iodine \nis consumed by the thiosulphate ions. Thus, \nthe end-point can easily be tracked and the \nrest is the stoichiometric calculation only. 7.3.4 Limitations of Concept of Oxidation Number As you have observed in the above discussion, the concept of redox processes has been evolving with time. This process of evolution \nis continuing. In fact, in recent past the \noxidation process is visualised as a decrease \nin electron density and reduction process as \nan increase in electron density around the \natom(s) involved in the reaction.7.4 REDOX REACTIONS AND ELECTRODE PROCESSESThe experiment corresponding to reaction (7.15), can also be observed if zinc rod is dipped in copper sulphate solution. The \nredox reaction takes place and during the Unit 7.indd   24910/10/2022   10:37:05 AM250reaction, zinc is oxidised to zinc ions and copper ions are reduced to metallic copper \ndue to direct transfer of electrons from zinc \nto copper ion. During this reaction heat is \nalso evolved.  Now we modify the experiment \nin such a manner that for the same redox \nreaction transfer of electrons takes place \nindirectly. This necessitates the separation \nof zinc metal from copper sulphate solution.  \nWe take copper sulphate solution in a beaker \nand put a copper strip or rod in it. We also \ntake zinc sulphate solution in another beaker \nand put a zinc rod or strip in it.  Now reaction \ntakes place in either of the beakers and at the \ninterface of the metal and its salt solution in \neach beaker both the reduced and oxidized \nforms of the same species are present.  These \nrepresent the species in the reduction and \noxidation half reactions. A redox couple is \ndefined as having together the oxidised and \nreduced forms of a substance taking part in \nan oxidation or reduction half reaction.This is represented by separating the oxidised form from the reduced form by \na vertical line or a slash representing an \ninterface (e.g. solid/solution).  For example \nin this experiment the two redox couples are represented as Zn2+/Zn and Cu2+/Cu.  In both cases, oxidised form is put before \nthe reduced form. Now we put the beaker \ncontaining copper sulphate solution and  the \nbeaker containing zinc sulphate solution \nside by side (Fig. 7.3). We connect solutions \nin two beakers by a salt bridge (a U-tube \ncontaining a solution of potassium chloride \nor ammonium nitrate usually solidified by \nboiling with agar agar and later cooling to a \njelly like substance). This provides an electric \ncontact between the two solutions without \nallowing them to mix with each other.  The \nzinc and copper rods are connected by a \nmetallic wire with a provision for an ammeter \nand a switch. The set-up as shown in Fig.7.3 \nis known as Daniell cell. When the switch is \nin the off position, no reaction takes place in \neither of the beakers and no current flows \nthrough the metallic wire.  As soon as the \nswitch is in the on position, we make the \nfollowing observations:1. The transfer of electrons now does not take place directly from Zn to Cu2+ but through the metallic wire connecting the \ntwo rods as is apparent from the arrow \nwhich indicates the flow of current.  2. The electricity from solution in one beaker to solution in the other beaker flows by \nthe migration of ions through the salt \nbridge.  We know that the flow of current \nis possible only if there is a potential \ndifference between the copper and zinc \nrods known as electrodes here.The potential  associated with each electrode is known as electrode potential. If the concentration of each species taking part in the electrode reaction is unity (if any \ngas appears in the electrode reaction, it is \nconfined to 1 atmospheric pressure) and \nfurther the reaction is carried out at 298K, \nthen the potential of each electrode is said \nto be the Standard Electrode Potential. By \nconvention, the standard electrode potential \n(E) of hydrogen electrode is 0.00 volts. The electrode potential value for each electrode \nprocess is a measure of the relative tendency \nof the active species in the process to remain \nin the oxidised/reduced form. A negative E means that the redox couple is a stronger Fig.7.3 The set-up for Daniell cell. Electrons produced at the anode due to oxidation of Zn travel through the external circuit \nto the cathode where these reduce the \ncopper ions. The circuit is completed \ninside the cell by the migration of ions \nthrough the salt bridge.  It may be noted \nthat the direction of current is opposite to \nthe direction of electron flow.Unit 7.indd   25010/10/2022   10:37:05 AM251 Reaction (Oxidised form + ne–        → Reduced form) E / VF2(g) + 2e–   → 2F–  2.87Co3+ + e–  → Co2+  1.81H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e–  → 2H2O     1.78MnO4– + 8H+ + 5e–  → Mn2+ + 4H2O  1.51Au3+ + 3e–  → Au(s)  1.40Cl2(g) + 2e–  → 2Cl–  1.36Cr2O72– + 14H+ + 6e–  → 2Cr3+ + 7H2O  1.33O2(g) + 4H+ + 4e–  → 2H2O  1.23MnO2(s) + 4H+ + 2e–  → Mn2+ + 2H2O  1.23Br2 + 2e–  → 2Br–  1.09NO3– + 4H+ + 3e–  → NO(g) + 2H2O  0.972Hg2+ + 2e–  → Hg22+  0.92Ag+ + e–  → Ag(s)  0.80Fe3+ + e–  → Fe2+  0.77O2(g) + 2H+ + 2e–  → H2O2  0.68I2(s) + 2e–  → 2I–  0.54Cu+ + e–  → Cu(s)  0.52Cu2+ + 2e–  → Cu(s)  0.34AgCl(s) + e–  → Ag(s) + Cl–  0.22AgBr(s) + e–  → Ag(s) + Br–  0.102H+ + 2e–  → H2(g)  0.00Pb2+ + 2e–  → Pb(s)  –0.13Sn2+ + 2e–  → Sn(s)  –0.14Ni2+ + 2e–  → Ni(s)  –0.25Fe2+ + 2e–  → Fe(s)  –0.44Cr3+ + 3e–  → Cr(s)  –0.74Zn2+ + 2e–  → Zn(s)  –0.762H2O + 2e– → H2(g) + 2OH–  –0.83Al3+ + 3e–  → Al(s)  –1.66Mg2+ + 2e–  → Mg(s)  –2.36Na+ + e–  → Na(s)  –2.71Ca2+ + 2e–  → Ca(s)  –2.87K+ + e–  → K(s)  –2.93Li+ + e–  → Li(s)  –3.05 Increasing strength of oxidising agent Increasing strength of reducing agent1.

Unit 7.indd   25110/10/2022   10:37:05 AM252SUMMARY Redox reactions form an important class of reactions in which oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously. Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation \nnumber, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail. Oxidation, \nreduction, oxidising agent (oxidant) and reducing agent (reductant) have been viewed \naccording to each conceptualisation. Oxidation numbers are assigned in accordance with a \nconsistent set of rules. Oxidation number and ion-electron method both are useful means in \nwriting equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories: \ncombination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions. The concept of \nredox couple and electrode processes is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide \napplications in the study of electrode processes and cells.EXERCISES7.1 Assign oxidation number to the underlined elements in each of the following species:  (a) NaH2PO4 (b) NaHSO4 (c)  H4P2O7 (d)  K2MnO4 (e) CaO2 (f)  NaBH4   (g)  H2S2O7 (h)  KAl(SO4)2.12 H2O7.2 What are the oxidation number of the underlined elements in each of the following and how do you rationalise your results ?

The resulting compounds are studied \nunder a separate branch of chemistry called organic \nchemistry. This unit incorporates some basic principles \nand techniques of analysis required for understanding the \nformation and properties of organic compounds.8.1 GENERAL INTRODUCTIONOrganic compounds are vital for sustaining life on earth and include complex molecules like genetic information bearing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and proteins that \nconstitute essential compounds of our blood, muscles and skin. Organic compounds appear in materials like clothing, fuels, polymers, dyes and medicines. These are some of \nthe important areas of application of these compounds.Science of organic chemistry is about two hundred years old. Around the year 1780, chemists began to \ndistinguish between organic compounds obtained from \nplants and animals and inorganic compounds prepared \nfrom mineral sources. Berzilius, a Swedish chemist \nproposed that a ‘vital force’ was responsible for the \nformation of organic compounds. However, this notion \nwas rejected in 1828 when F. Wohler synthesised an \norganic compound, urea from an inorganic compound, \nammonium cyanate.NH4CNO     NH2CONH2Ammonium cyanate          UreaThe pioneering synthesis of acetic acid by Kolbe (1845) and that of methane by Berthelot (1856) showed conclusively that organic compounds could be synthesised \nfrom inorganic sources in a laboratory.UNIT 8Unit 8.indd   2562/24/2023   16:52:17257The development of electronic theory of covalent bonding ushered organic chemistry into its modern shape.8.2 tetraValence OF carBOn:  shaPes OF Organic cOmPOunds8.2.1 The Shapes of Carbon Compounds  The knowledge of fundamental concepts of molecular structure helps in understanding and predicting the properties of organic \ncompounds. You have already learnt theories \nof valency and molecular structure in Unit 4. \nAlso, you already know that tetravalence of \ncarbon and the formation of covalent bonds \nby it are explained in terms of its electronic \nconfiguration and the hybridisation of s and p orbitals. It may be recalled that formation and \nthe shapes of molecules like methane (CH4), ethene (C2H4), ethyne (C2H2) are explained in terms of the use of sp3, sp2 and sp hybrid orbitals by carbon atoms in the respective \nmolecules. Hybridisation influences the bond length and bond enthalpy (strength) in compounds. \nThe sp hybrid orbital contains more s character and hence it is closer to its nucleus \nand forms shorter and stronger bonds than \nthe sp3 hybrid orbital. The sp2 hybrid orbital is intermediate in s character between sp and sp3 and, hence, the length and enthalpy of the bonds it forms, are also intermediate \nbetween them. The change in hybridisation \naffects the electronegativity of carbon. The \ngreater the s character of the hybrid orbitals, \nthe greater is the electronegativity. Thus, a \ncarbon atom having an sp hybrid orbital with 50% s character is more electronegative than that possessing  sp2 or sp3 hybridised orbitals. This relative electronegativity is reflected in \nseveral physical and chemical properties of \nthe molecules concerned, about which you \nwill learn in later units. 8.2.2  some characteristic Features of π BondsIn a π (pi) bond formation, parallel orientation of the two p orbitals on adjacent atoms is necessary for a proper sideways overlap. Thus, in H2C=CH2 molecule all the atoms must be in the same plane. The p orbitals are mutually parallel and both the p orbitals are perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. \nRotation of one CH2 fragment with respect to other interferes with maximum overlap \nof p orbitals and, therefore, such rotation about carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is \nrestricted. The electron charge cloud of the π \nbond is located above and below the plane of \nbonding atoms. This results in the electrons \nbeing easily available to the attacking  reagents. In general, π bonds provide the most reactive centres in the molecules containing multiple bonds.Problem 8.1How many σ and π bonds are present in each of the following molecules?(a) HC≡CCH=CHCH3 (b) CH2=C=CHCH3 solution(a) σC – C: 4; σC–H : 6; πC=C :1; π C≡C:2(b) σC – C: 3; σC–H: 6; πC=C: 2.Problem 8.2What is the type of hybridisation of each carbon in the following compounds?

The Lewis structure or dot structure, dash structure, condensed structure and bond line structural \nformulas are some of the specific types. The \nLewis structures, however, can be simplified \nby representing the two-electron covalent �bond by a dash (–). Such a structural formula \nfocuses on the electrons involved in bond \nformation.  A single dash represents a single \nbond, double dash  is used for double bond \nand a triple dash represents triple bond. Lone-\npairs of electrons on heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, \nnitrogen, sulphur, halogens etc.) may or may \nnot be shown. Thus, ethane (C2H6), ethene (C2H4), ethyne (C2H2) and methanol (CH3OH) can be represented by the following structural \nformulas. Such structural representations are \ncalled complete structural formulas.Similarly, CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 can be further condensed to CH3(CH2)6CH3. For further simplification, organic chemists \nuse another way of representing the \nstructures, in which only lines are used. \nIn this bond-line structural representation \nof organic compounds, carbon and \nhydrogen atoms are not shown and the \nlines representing carbon-carbon bonds are  \ndrawn in a zig-zag fashion. The only atoms \nspecifically written are oxygen, chlorine, \nnitrogen etc. The terminals denote methyl  (–CH3) groups (unless indicated otherwise by a functional group), while the line junctions \ndenote carbon atoms bonded to appropriate \nnumber of hydrogens required to satisfy the \nvalency of the carbon atoms. Some of the \nexamples are represented as follows:(i) 3-Methyloctane can be represented in various forms as:(a)   CH3CH2CHCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3                     |                   CH3 These structural formulas can be further abbreviated by omitting some or all of the dashes representing covalent bonds and by \nindicating the number of identical groups \nattached to an atom by a subscript. The \nresulting expression of the compound is \ncalled a condensed structural formula. Thus, \nethane, ethene, ethyne and methanol can be \nwritten as:CH3CH3        H2C=CH2       HC≡CH            CH3OH Ethane       Ethene         Ethyne      Methanol        Ethane                  Ethene                  Ethyne              Methanol(ii) Various ways of representing 2-bromo butane are:(a)  CH3CHBrCH2CH3  (b)  (c)  (b)(c)Unit 8.indd   25810/10/2022   10:37:29 AM259In cyclic compounds, the bond-line formulas may be given as follows:CyclopropaneCyclopentanechlorocyclohexaneProblem 8.4Expand each of the following condensed formulas into their complete structural \nformulas.(a) CH3CH2COCH2CH3(b) CH3CH=CH(CH2)3CH3solution(a) (b)  (b) solutionCondensed formula:(a) HO(CH2)3CH(CH3)CH(CH3)2(b) HOCH(CN)2Bond-line formula:Problem 8.5For each of the following compounds, write a  condensed formula and also their \nbond-line formula.(a) HOCH2CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH3(b)(a)Problem 8.6Expand each of the following bond-line formulas to show all the atoms including \ncarbon and hydrogen(a)(b)(c)(d)solutionUnit 8.indd   25910/10/2022   10:37:30 AM260 Framework model Ball and stick modelSpace filling modelFig. 8.28.3.2  Three-Dimensional Representation of Organic \nMoleculesThe three-dimensional (3-D) structure of organic molecules can be represented on \npaper by using certain conventions. For \nexample, by using solid () and dashed () wedge formula, the 3-D image of a molecule from a two-dimensional picture can be perceived. In these formulas the solid-wedge is used to indicate a bond \nprojecting out of the plane of paper, towards \nthe observer. The dashed-wedge is used to \ndepict the bond projecting out of the plane of \nthe paper and away from the observer. Wedges \nare shown in such a way that the broad end of \nthe wedge is towards the observer. The bonds \nlying in plane of the paper are depicted by \nusing a normal line (—). 3-D representation of \nmethane molecule on paper has been shown \nin Fig. 8.1 Fig. 8.1 Wedge-and-dash representation of CH4Molecular ModelsMolecular models are physical devices \nthat are used for a better visualisation and \nperception of three-dimensional shapes \nof organic molecules. These are made of \nwood, plastic or metal and are commercially \navailable. Commonly three types of molecular \nmodels are used: (1) Framework model, (2) \nBall-and-stick model, and (3) Space filling \nmodel. In the framework model only the bonds connecting the atoms of a molecule \nand not the atoms themselves are shown. \nThis model emphasizes the pattern of \nbonds of a molecule while ignoring the size \nof atoms. In the ball-and-stick model, both the atoms and the bonds are shown. Balls \nrepresent atoms and the stick denotes a \nbond. Compounds containing C=C (e.g., \nethene) can best be represented by using \nsprings in place of sticks. These models are \nreferred to as ball-and-spring model. The \nspace-filling model emphasises the relative \nsize of each atom based on its van der Waals \nradius. Bonds are not shown in this model. \nIt conveys the volume occupied by each atom \nin the molecule. In addition to these models, \ncomputer graphics can also be used for \nmolecular modelling. Unit 8.indd   26011/10/2022   15:19:57261                        8.4 CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDSThe existing large number of organic compounds and their ever-increasing numbers has made it necessary to classify \nthem on the basis of their structures. Organic \ncompounds are broadly classified as follows:I. Acyclic or open chain compoundsThese compounds are also called as aliphatic compounds and consist of straight or \nbranched chain compounds, for example:(homocyclic).CyclohexaneCyclohexeneCyclopropane Sometimes atoms other than carbon are \nalso present in the ring (heterocylic). \nTetrahydrofuran given below is an example \nof this type of compound:TetrahydrofuranThese exhibit some of the properties similar \nto those of aliphatic compounds.(b) Aromatic compoundsAromatic compounds are special types of compounds. You will learn about these compounds in detail in Unit 9. These include \nbenzene and other related ring compounds \n(benzenoid). Like alicyclic compounds, \naromatic comounds may also have hetero \natom in the ring. Such compounds are called \nhetrocyclic aromatic compounds. Some of \nthe examples of various types of aromatic \ncompounds are:Benzenoid aromatic compoundsBenzene          Aniline            NaphthaleneNon-benzenoid compoundTroponeIsobutaneAcetaldehydeAcetic acidCH3CH3EthaneII Cyclic or closed chain or ring compounds(a) Alicyclic compounds Alicyclic (aliphatic cyclic) compounds contain carbon atoms joined in the form of a ring  Unit 8.indd   26111/10/2022   15:20:58262Heterocyclic aromatic compounds   Furan             Thiophene            PyridineOrganic compounds can also be classified on the basis of functional groups, into families or homologous series. 8.4.1 Functional GroupThe functional group is an atom  or a group of atoms joined to the carbon chain which is \nresponsible for the characteristic chemical properties of the organic compounds. The �examples are hydroxyl group (–OH), aldehyde �group (–CHO) and carboxylic acid group (–\nCOOH) etc.8.4.2 Homologous SeriesA group or a series of organic compounds each containing a characteristic functional group forms a homologous series and the members of \nthe series are called homologues. The members of a homologous series can be represented by \ngeneral molecular formula and the successive \nmembers differ from each other in molecular �formula by a –CH2 unit. There are a number of homologous series of organic compounds. \nSome of these are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, \nhaloalkanes, alkanols, alkanals, alkanones, \nalkanoic acids, amines etc. It is also possible that a compound contains two or more identical or different functional \ngroups. This gives rise to polyfunctional compounds.8.5  NOMENCLATURE OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDSOrganic chemistry deals with millions of compounds. In order to clearly identify \nthem, a systematic method of naming has \nbeen developed and is known as the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) system of nomenclature. In this \nsystematic nomenclature, the names are correlated with the structure such that the \nreader or listener can deduce the structure \nfrom the name.  Before the IUPAC system of nomenclature, however, organic compounds were assigned names based on their origin or certain properties. For instance, citric acid is named so because it is found in citrus fruits and the \nacid found in red ant is named formic acid \nsince the Latin word for ant is formica. These \nnames are traditional and are considered \nas trivial or common names. Some common names are followed even today. For example,  \nBuckminsterfullerene is a common name \ngiven to the newly discovered C60 cluster (a form of carbon) noting its structural similarity \nto the geodesic domes popularised by the \nfamous architect R. Buckminster Fuller. \nCommon names are useful and in many \ncases indispensable, particularly when the \nalternative systematic names are lengthy and \ncomplicated. Common names of some organic \ncompounds are given in Table 8.1. Table 8.1 Common or Trivial Names of Some Organic Compounds8.5.1  The IUPAC System of NomenclatureA systematic name of an organic compound is generally derived by identifying the parent hydrocarbon and the functional group(s) \nattached to it. See the example given below. Unit 8.indd   26211/10/2022   15:20:58263By further using prefixes and suffixes, the parent name can be modified to obtain the \nactual name. Compounds containing carbon \nand hydrogen only are called hydrocarbons. \nA hydrocarbon is termed saturated if it \ncontains only carbon-carbon single bonds. \nThe IUPAC name for a homologous series of \nsuch compounds is alkane. Paraffin (Latin: \nlittle affinity) was the earlier name given to \nthese compounds. Unsaturated hydrocarbons \nare those, which contain at least one carbon-\ncarbon double or triple bond. 8.5.2 iuPac nomenclature of  alkanesStraight chain hydrocarbons: The names of such compounds are based on their chain structure, and end with suffix ‘-ane’ and carry \na prefix indicating the number of carbon \natoms present in the chain (except from CH4 to C4H10, where the prefixes are derived from trivial names). The IUPAC names of some \nstraight chain saturated hydrocarbons are \ngiven in Table 8.2. The alkanes in Table \n8.2 differ from each other by merely the \nnumber of -CH2 groups in the chain. They are homologues of alkane series.In order to name such compounds, the names of alkyl groups are prefixed to the name of \nparent alkane. An alkyl group is derived \nfrom a saturated hydrocarbon by removing \na hydrogen atom from carbon.  Thus, CH4 becomes  -CH3 and is called methyl group. An alkyl group is named by substituting ‘yl’ for \n‘ane’ in the corresponding alkane. Some alkyl groups are listed in Table 8.3.table 8.3  some alkyl groupstable 8.2 iuPac names of some unbranched Saturated HydrocarbonsBranched chain hydrocarbons: In a branched chain compound small chains of carbon atoms are attached at one or more \ncarbon atoms of the parent chain. The small \ncarbon chains (branches) are called alkyl \ngroups. For example:CH3–CH–CH2–CH3  CH3–CH–CH2–CH–CH3               CH3              CH2CH3   CH3(a) (b) Abbreviations are used for some alkyl groups. For example, methyl is abbreviated as Me, ethyl as Et, propyl as Pr and butyl as Bu. The alkyl groups can be branched also. Thus, \npropyl and butyl groups can have branched \nstructures as shown below. CH3-CH- CH3-CH2-CH-      CH3-CH-CH2-                                                                      CH3CH3CH3Isopropyl-sec-Butyl-Isobutyl-                      CH3            CH3CH3-C-           CH3-C-CH2-               CH3                     CH3tert-Butyl-            Neopentyl- Common branched groups have specific trivial names. For example, the propyl groups can either be n-propyl group or isopropyl group. The branched butyl groups are called sec-butyl, isobutyl and tert-butyl group. \nWe also encounter the structural unit,  –CH2C(CH3)3, which is called neopentyl group.Nomenclature of branched chain alkanes:  We encounter a number of branched chain \nalkanes. The rules for naming them are given below.Unit 8.indd   26310/10/2022   10:37:31 AM264separated from the groups by hyphens and there is no break between methyl  and nonane.] 4. If two or more identical substituent \ngroups are present then the numbers \nare separated by commas. The names of \nidentical substituents are not repeated, instead prefixes such as di (for 2), tri  (for 3), tetra (for 4), penta (for 5), hexa (for \n6) etc. are used. While writing the name \nof the substituents in alphabetical order, \nthese prefixes, however, are not considered. \nThus, the following compounds are  named as:  CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3      CH3-CH-CH2-CH-CH3 CH3 C CH2CH CH3 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 52,4-Dimethylpentane 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane  H3C H2C CH3        CH3CH2CHCCH2CH2CH3  1 2 3 4 5 6 7     CH3 3-Ethyl-4,4-dimethylheptane 5. If the two substituents are found in \nequivalent positions, the lower number is given to the one coming first in the �alphabetical listing. Thus, the following \ncompound is 3-ethyl-6-methyloctane and \nnot 6-ethyl-3-methyloctane. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8CH3 — CH2—CH—CH2—CH2—CH—CH2 —CH3          CH2CH3  CH3 6. The branched alkyl groups can be \nnamed by following the above mentioned \nprocedures. However, the carbon atom of the branch that attaches to the root �alkane is numbered 1 as exemplified \nbelow. 4 3 2 1 CH3–CH–CH2–CH–       CH3 CH3  1,3-Dimethylbutyl-1. First of all, the longest carbon chain in �the molecule is identified. In the example  (I) given below, the longest chain has nine \ncarbons and it is considered as the parent \nor root chain. Selection of parent chain as shown in (II) is not correct because it has \nonly eight carbons.2. The carbon atoms of the parent chain are numbered to identify the parent alkane and to locate the positions of the carbon \natoms at which branching takes place due \nto the substitution of alkyl group in place \nof hydrogen atoms. The numbering is �done in such a way that the branched �carbon atoms get the lowest possible \nnumbers. Thus, the numbering in the above example should be from left to right \n(branching at carbon atoms 2 and 6) and \nnot from right to left (giving numbers \n4 and  8 to the carbon atoms at which branches are attached).  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9C  C  C  C  C  C  C  C  C      C    CC9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1C  C  C  C  C  C  C  C  C     C   C  C 3. The names of  alkyl groups attached as a branch are then prefixed to the name of the parent alkane and position \nof the substituents is indicated by the \nappropriate numbers. If different alkyl \ngroups are present, they are listed in \nalphabetical order. Thus, name for the \ncompound shown above is: 6-ethyl-2-methylnonane. [Note: the numbers are Unit 8.indd   26410/10/2022   10:37:31 AM265The name of such branched chain alkyl group is placed in parenthesis while naming the \ncompound. While writing the trivial names \nof substituents’ in alphabetical order, the \nprefixes iso- and neo- are considered to be \nthe part of the fundamental name of alkyl \ngroup. The prefixes sec- and tert- are not  \nconsidered to be the part of the fundamental \nname. The use of iso and related common \nprefixes for naming alkyl groups is also \nallowed by the IUPAC nomenclature as long \nas these are not further substituted. In multi-\nsubstituted compounds, the following rules \nmay aso be remembered:•\tIf\tthere\thappens\tto\tbe\ttwo\tchains\tof\tequal\tsize, then that chain is to be selected which contains more number of side chains.•\tAfter\tselection\tof\tthe\tchain,\tnumbering\tis to be done from the end closer to the \nsubstituent.5-(2,2-Dimethylpropyl)nonane     Problem 8.7Structures and IUPAC names of some \nhydrocarbons are given below.

If side \nchains are present, then the rules given above \nare applied.

Compounds having the same functional \ngroup undergo similar reactions. For example, \nCH3OH, CH3CH2OH, and (CH3)2CHOH — all having -OH functional group liberate \nhydrogen on reaction with sodium metal. \nThe presence of functional groups enables \nsystematisation of organic compounds into \ndifferent classes. Examples of some functional \ngroups with their prefixes and suffixes along \nwith some examples of organic compounds \npossessing these are given in Table 8.4.First of all, the functional group present in the molecule is identified which determines \nthe choice of appropriate suffix. The longest chain of carbon atoms containing the �functional group is numbered in such a way �that the functional group is attached at the �carbon atom possessing lowest possible \nnumber in the chain. By using the suffix as given in Table 8.4, the name of the compound is arrived at. In the case of polyfunctional compounds, one of the functional groups is chosen as the principal functional group and the compound \nis then named on that basis. The remaining \nfunctional groups, which are subordinate \nfunctional groups, are named as substituents \nusing the appropriate prefixes. The choice of \nprincipal functional group is made on the basis \nof order of preference. The order of decreasing �priority for some functional groups is: -cOOh, –sO3h, -cOOr (r=alkyl group), cOcl,   -CONH2, -cn,-hc=O,  \u003ec=O, -Oh, -nh2, \u003e c=c\u003c,  -c≡C- . The –R, C6H5-, halogens (F, Cl, Br, I), –NO2, alkoxy (–OR) etc. are always prefix substituents. Thus, a compound containing \nboth an alcohol and a keto group is named \nas hydroxyalkanone since the keto group is \npreferred to the hydroxyl group. For example, HOCH2(CH2)3CH2COCH3 will be named as 7-hydroxyheptan-2-one and not \nas 2-oxoheptan -7-ol. Similarly, BrCH2CH=CH2  is named as 3-bromoprop-1-ene and not \n1-bromoprop-2-ene.  If more than one functional group of the same type are present, their number is \nindicated by adding di, tri, etc. before the class suffix. In such cases the full name of the parent alkane is written before the class suffix. For example CH2(OH)CH2(OH) is named as  ethane–1,2–diol. However, the ending – ne of \nthe parent alkane is dropped  in the case of \ncompounds having more than  one  double or \ntriple bond; for example, CH2=CH-CH=CH2 is named as buta–1,3–diene.Problem 8.8Write the IUPAC names of the compounds  i-iv from their given structures.solution • The functional group present is an \nalcohol (OH). Hence the suffix is ‘-ol’.• The longest chain containing -OH \nhas eight carbon atoms. Hence the  corresponding saturated hydrocar-bon is octane.• The -OH is on carbon atom 3.

Hence, the systematic name of this \ncompound is 6-Methyloctan-3-ol.solutionThe functional group present is ketone \n(\u003eC=O), hence suffix ‘-one’. Presence \nof two keto groups is indicated by ‘di’, hence suffix becomes ‘dione’. The two \nketo groups are at carbons 2 and 4. \nThe longest chain contains 6 carbon \natoms, hence, parent hydrocarbon is \nhexane. Thus, the systematic name is \nHexane-2,4-dione.Unit 8.indd   26610/10/2022   10:37:32 AM267table 8.4  some Functional groups and classes of Organic compoundsUnit 8.indd   26710/10/2022   10:37:32 AM268solutionHere, two functional groups namely ketone and carboxylic acid are present. The principal functional group is the \ncarboxylic acid group; hence the parent \nchain will be suffixed with ‘oic’ acid. \nNumbering of the chain starts from �carbon of – COOH functional group. \nThe keto group in the chain at carbon \n5 is indicated by ‘oxo’. The longest \nchain including the principal functional  \ngroup has 6 carbon atoms; hence the \nparent hydrocarbon is hexane. The \ncompound is, therefore, named as  5-Oxohexanoic acid.solutionThe two C=C functional groups are present at carbon atoms 1 and 3, while \nthe C≡C functional group is present at \ncarbon 5. These groups are indicated by \nsuffixes ‘diene’ and ‘yne’ respectively. The \nlongest chain containing the functional \ngroups has 6 carbon atoms; hence the \nparent hydrocarbon is hexane.

The \nfunctional group chloro is present at \ncarbon 2. Hence, the structure of the \ncompound is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH(Cl)CH3.(ii) ‘pent’ indicates that parent hydrocarbon contains 5 carbon atoms \nin the chain. ‘en’ and ‘ol’ correspond to \nthe functional groups C=C and -OH at \ncarbon atoms 4 and 2 respectively. Thus, \nthe structure is CH2=CHCH2CH (OH)CH3.(iii) Six membered ring containing a carbon-carbon double bond is implied \nby cyclohexene, which is numbered as \nshown in (I). The prefix 3-nitro means \nthat a nitro group is present on C-3. \nThus, complete structural formula of the \ncompound is (II). Double bond is suffixed \nfunctional group whereas NO2 is prefixed functional group therefore double bond �gets preference over –NO2 group:(iv) ‘1-ol’ means that a -OH group is \npresent at C-1. OH is suffixed functional \ngroup and gets preference over C=C \nbond. Thus the structure is as shown  in (II):(v) ‘heptanal’ indicates the compound to be an aldehyde containing 7 carbon \natoms in the parent chain. The  ‘6-hydroxy’ indicates that -OH group is \npresent at carbon 6. Thus, the structural \nformula of the compound is: CH3CH(OH)CH2CH2CH2CH2CHO. Carbon atom of –CHO group is included while numbering \nthe carbon chain.8.5.4 nomenclature of substituted Benzene compoundsFor IUPAC nomenclature of substituted benzene compounds, the substituent is placed as prefix to the word benzene as shown \nin the following examples. However, common \nnames (written in bracket below) of many \nsubstituted benzene compounds are also universally used. Unit 8.indd   26810/10/2022   10:37:32 AM269If benzene ring is disubstituted, the position of substituents is defined by numbering the carbon atoms of the \nring such that the substituents are \nlocated at the lowest numbers possible.\nFor example, the compound(b) is named \nas 1,3-dibromobenzene and not as 1,5-dibromobenzene. Substituent of the base compound is assigned number1 and then the direction of numbering is chosen such that the \nnext substituent gets the lowest number. \nThe substituents appear in the name in \nalphabetical order. Some examples are given \nbelow.Methylbenzene      Methoxybenzene     Aminobenzene\n    (Toluene)              (Anisole)                 (Aniline)      Nitrobenzene                  Bromobenzene1,2-Dibromo- benzene1,3-Dibromo- benzene1,4-Dibromo- benzene(a)(b)(c) In the trivial system of nomenclature the terms ortho (o), meta (m) and para (p) are used as prefixes to indicate the relative \npositions 1,2;1,3 and 1,4 respectively. Thus, \n1,3-dibromobenzene (b) is named as  m-dibromobenzene (meta is abbreviated as m-) and the other isomers of dibromobenzene 1,2-(a) and 1,4-(c), are named as ortho (or just o-) and para (or just p-)-dibromobenzene, respectively.  For tri - or higher substituted benzene derivatives, these prefixes cannot be used \nand the compounds are named by identifying substituent positions on the ring by following \nthe lowest locant rule. In some cases, common \nname of benzene derivatives is taken as  the \nbase compound.1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (not 4-chloro,1,3-dinitrobenzene)                2-Chloro-1-methyl-4-nitrobenzene (not 4-methyl-5-chloro-nitrobenzene)    2-Chloro-4-methylanisole4-Ethyl-2-methylaniline 3,4-Dimethylphenol When a benzene ring is attached to an alkane with a functional group, it is considered as substituent, instead of a parent. The name \nfor benzene as substituent is phenyl (C6H5-, also abbreviated as Ph).Unit 8.indd   26910/10/2022   10:37:33 AM270different carbon skeletons, these are referred to as chain isomers and the phenomenon is \ntermed as chain isomerism. For example, \nC5H12 represents three compounds:IsomerismStructural isomerismStereoisomerismChainisomerismPositionisomerismFunctionalgroupisomerismMetamerismGeometricalisomerismOpticalisomerism8.6 isOmerismThe phenomenon of existence of two or more \ncompounds possessing the same molecular \nformula but different properties is known as isomerism. Such compounds are called \nas isomers. The following flow chart shows \ndifferent types of isomerism. 8.6.1 structural isomerismCompounds having the same molecular formula but different structures (manners in which atoms are linked) are classified as \nstructural isomers. Some typical examples \nof different types of structural isomerism are \ngiven below: (i) Chain isomerism: When two or more compounds have similar molecular formula but (a)  (b)(c) (d)Problem 8.10Write the structural formula of:(a)  o-Ethylanisole, (b) p-Nitroaniline, (c)  2,3 - Dibromo -1 - phenylpentane,(d)  4-Ethyl-1-fluoro-2-nitrobenzene.solution                         CH3                 CH3 C CH3                                       CH3 Neopentane(2,2-Dimethylpropane)(ii) Position isomerism: When two or more compounds differ in the position of \nsubstituent atom or functional group on \nthe carbon skeleton, they are called position \nisomers and this phenomenon is termed \nas position isomerism. For example, the \nmolecular formula C3H8O represents two alcohols:(iii) Functional group isomerism: Two or more compounds having the same molecular \nformula but different functional groups \nare called functional isomers and this \nphenomenon is termed as functional group \nisomerism. For example, the molecular \nformula C3H6O represents an aldehyde and a ketone:  CH3  CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3 CH3−CHCH2CH3     Pentane Isopentane   (2-Methylbutane)  OH  CH3CH2CH2OH CH3−CH-CH3 Propan-1-ol  Propan-2-olUnit 8.indd   27010/10/2022   10:37:33 AM271(iv) Metamerism: It arises due to different alkyl chains on either side of the functional group in the molecule. For example, C4H10O represents methoxypropane (CH3OC3H7) and ethoxyethane (C2H5OC2H5).8.6.2 StereoisomerismThe compounds that have the same constitution and sequence of covalent bonds \nbut differ in relative positions of their atoms \nor groups in space are called stereoisomers. \nThis special type of isomerism is called as \nstereoisomerism and can be classified as \ngeometrical and optical isomerism. 8.7 FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS IN ORGANIC REACTION MECHANISMIn an organic reaction, the organic molecule (also referred as a substrate) reacts with an \nappropriate attacking reagent and leads to \nthe formation of one or more intermediate(s) \nand finally product(s)The general reaction is depicted as follows : in understanding the reactivity of organic compounds and in planning strategy for their \nsynthesis. In the following sections, we shall learn some of the principles that explain how these \nreactions take place. 8.7.1 Fission of a Covalent Bond\nA covalent bond can get cleaved either by : (i) heterolytic cleavage, or by (ii) homolytic \ncleavage.  In heterolytic cleavage, the bond breaks in such a fashion that the shared pair of electrons remains with  one of the fragments. After heterolysis, one atom has a sextet electronic structure and a positive charge and \nthe other, a valence octet with at least one lone \npair and a negative charge. Thus, heterolytic cleavage of bromomethane will give C+H3 and Br– as shown below. A species having a carbon atom possessing  sextext of electrons and a positive charge is called a carbocation (earlier called carbonium ion). The H3 ion is known as a methyl cation or methyl carbonium ion. Carbocations are \nclassified as primary, secondary or tertiary depending on  whether one, two or three  \ncarbons are directly attached to the positively \ncharged carbon. Some other examples of \ncarbocations are: CH3C+H2 (ethyl cation, a primary carbocation), (CH3)2C+H (isopropyl cation, a secondary carbocation), and (CH3)3C+ (tert-butyl cation, a tertiary carbocation). Carbocations are highly unstable and \nreactive species. Alkyl groups directly \nattached to the positively charged carbon \nstabilise the carbocations due to inductive \nand hyperconjugation effects, which you will \nbe studying in the sections 8.7.5 and 8.7.9. \nThe observed order of carbocation stability \nis: C+H3 \u003c CH3C+H2 \u003c (CH3)2C+H \u003c (CH3)3C+. These carbocations have trigonal planar shape \nwith positively charged carbon being sp2 hybridised. Thus, the shape of C+H3 may be considered as being derived from the overlap \nof three equivalent C(sp2) hybridised orbitals with 1s orbital of each of the three hydrogen Organicmolecule\n(Substrate)[Intermediate]Product(s)Attacking ReagentByproductsSubstrate is that reactant which supplies carbon to the new bond and the other reactant \nis called reagent. If both the reactants \nsupply carbon to the new bond then choice \nis arbitrary and in that case the molecule on \nwhich attention is focused is called substrate.In such a reaction a covalent bond  between two carbon atoms or a carbon and \nsome other atom is broken and a new bond is \nformed. A sequential account of each step, describing details of electron movement, \nenergetics during bond cleavage and bond \nformation, and the rates of transformation \nof reactants into products (kinetics) is \nreferred to as reaction mechanism. The \nknowledge of reaction mechanism helps   O    H  \t\t\t CH3−C-CH3 CH3−CH2—C= O Propanone\t\tPropanalUnit 8.indd   27112/13/2022   10:12:45272atoms. Each bond may be represented as C(sp2)–H(1s) sigma bond. The remaining carbon orbital is perpendicular to the \nmolecular plane and contains no electrons. \n[Fig. 8.3(a)]. Fig. 8.3 (a)  Shape of methyl carbocationThe heterolytic cleavage can also give a species in which carbon gets the shared \npair of electrons. For example, when group \nZ attached to  the carbon leaves without electron pair, the methyl anion  is formed. Such a carbon species carrying a \nnegative charge on carbon atom is called \ncarbanion.  Carbon in carbanion is generally \nsp3 hybridised and its structure is distorted tetrahedron as shown in Fig. 8.3(b). Fig. 8.3 (b)  Shape of methyl carbanionCarbanions are also unstable and reactive \nspecies. The organic reactions which proceed \nthrough heterolytic bond cleavage are called \nionic or heteropolar or just polar reactions. In homolytic cleavage, one of the electrons of the shared pair in a covalent bond goes \nwith each of the bonded atoms. Thus, in \nhomolytic cleavage, the movement of a \nsingle electron takes place instead of an \nelectron pair. The single electron movement \nis shown by ‘half-headed’ (fish hook:) curved arrow. Such cleavage results in \nthe formation of neutral species (atom or \ngroup) which contains an unpaired electron. \nThese species are called free radicals. Like \ncarbocations and carbanions, free radicals are \nalso very reactive. A homolytic cleavage can be  shown as:       Alkyl        free radicalAlkyl radicals are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Alkyl radical stability \nincreases as we proceed from primary to \ntertiary:  ,  Methyl Ethyl Isopropyl Tert-butyl free  free  free free radical radical radical radicalOrganic reactions, which proceed by homolytic fission are called free radical or \nhomopolar or nonpolar reactions. 8.7.2 substrate and reagent Ions are generally not formed in the reactions of organic compounds. Molecules as such participate in the reaction. It is convenient to \nname one reagent as substrate and other as \nreagent. In general, a molecule whose carbon \nis involved in new bond formation is called \nsubstrate and the other one is called reagent. \nWhen carbon-carbon bond is formed, the \nchoice of naming the reactants as substrate \nand reagent is arbitrary and depends on \nmolecule under observation. Example:(i)  CH2 = CH2  +  Br2  → CH2 Br – CH2Br Substrate   Reagent Product(ii)  Nucleophiles and ElectrophilesReagents attack the reactive site of the substrate. The reactive site may be electron Unit 8.indd   27210/10/2022   10:37:34 AM273deficient portion of the molecule (a positive reactive site) e.g., an atom with incomplete \nelectron shell or the positive end of the dipole \nin the molecule. If the attacking species is \nelectron rich, it attacks these sites. If attacking \nspecies is electron deficient, the reactive site \nfor it is that part of the substrate molecule \nwhich can supply electrons, e.g., π electrons \nin a double bond.A reagent that brings an electron pair to the reactive site is called a nucleophile (Nu:) \ni.e., nucleus seeking and the reaction is then \ncalled nucleophilic. A reagent that takes away an electron pair from reactive site is called \nelectrophile (E+) i.e., electron seeking and the reaction is called electrophilic. During a polar organic reaction, a nucleophile attacks an electrophilic centre \nof the substrate which is that specific atom \nor part of the substrate which is electron \ndeficient. Similarly, the electrophiles attack \nat  nucleophilic centre, which is the electron  \nrich centre of the substrate. Thus, the \nelectrophiles receive electron pair from the \nsubstrate when the two undergo bonding \ninteraction. A curved-arrow notation is used \nto show the movement of an electron pair \nfrom the nucleophile to the electrophile. Some \nexamples of nucleophiles are the negatively \ncharged ions with lone pair of electrons  such \nas hydroxide (HO– ), cyanide (NC–) ions and carbanions (R3C:–). Neutral molecules such  as  etc., can also act as nucleophiles due to the presence of lone \npair of electrons. Examples of electrophiles  include carbocations (C+H3) and neutral molecules having functional groups like \ncarbonyl group (\u003eC=O) or alkyl halides  (R3C-X, where X is a halogen atom). The  carbon atom in carbocations has sextet \nconfiguration; hence, it is electron deficient  and can receive a pair of electrons from the \nnucleophiles. In neutral molecules such as \nalkyl halides, due to the polarity of the C-X \nbond a partial positive charge is generated  on the carbon atom and hence the carbon \natom becomes an electrophilic centre at which \na nucleophile can attack.Problem 8.11Using curved-arrow notation, show the formation of reactive  intermediates when \nthe following covalent bonds undergo \nheterolytic cleavage. (a) CH3–SCH3, (b) CH3–CN, (c) CH3–CuSolution Problem 8.12\nGiving justification, categorise the following molecules/ions as nucleophile \nor electrophile:SolutionNucleophiles: HS–,C2H5O–,(CH3)3N:H2N:– These species have unshared pair of electrons, which can be donated and \nshared with an electrophile.Electrophiles: BF3,C1+ H3–C+=O,N+ O2. Reactive sites have only six valence electrons; can accept electron pair from \na nucleophile.Problem 8.13 Identify electrophilic centre in the \nfollowing: CH3CH=O, CH3CN, CH3I.SolutionAmong CH3HC*=O, H3CC*≡N, and  H3C*–I, the starred carbon atoms are electrophilic centers as they will have partial positive charge due to polarity of \nthe bond. 8.7.3 Electron Movement in Organic ReactionsThe movement of electrons in organic reactions can be shown by curved-arrow Unit 8.indd   27311/10/2022   15:21:53274notation. It shows how changes in bonding occur due to electronic redistribution during \nthe reaction. To show the change in position \nof a pair of electrons, curved arrow starts \nfrom the point from where an electron pair is \nshifted and it ends at a location to which the \npair of electron may move. Presentation of shifting of electron pair is given below : (i)   from π bond to      adjacent bond position(ii)  from π bond to      adjacent atom(iii)  from atom to adjacent      bond  positionMovement of single electron is indicated by a single barbed ‘fish hooks’ (i.e. half headed curved arrow). For example, in transfer of \nhydroxide ion giving ethanol and in the \ndissociation of chloromethane, the movement \nof electron using curved arrows can be \ndepicted as follows: 8.7.4 electron displacement effects in covalent Bonds The electron displacement in an organic molecule may take place either in the ground state under the influence of an atom or a \nsubstituent group or in the presence of an \nappropriate attacking reagent. The electron \ndisplacements due to the influence of  an atom or a substituent group present in \nthe molecule cause permanent polarlisation \nof the bond. Inductive effect and resonance \neffects are examples of this type of electron \ndisplacements. Temporary electron \ndisplacement effects are seen in a molecule when a reagent approaches to attack it. \nThis type of electron displacement is called \nelectromeric effect or polarisability effect. \nIn the following sections we will learn about \nthese types of electronic displacements.8.7.5 inductive effectWhen a covalent bond is formed between atoms of different electronegativity, the electron density is more towards the more \nelectronegative atom of the bond. Such a shift \nof electron density results in a polar covalent \nbond. Bond polarity leads to various electronic \neffects in organic compounds. Let us consider cholorethane (CH3CH2Cl) in which the C–Cl bond is a polar covalent bond. It is polarised in such a way that the \ncarbon-1 gains some positive charge (δ+) and the chlorine some negative charge (δ–). The fractional electronic charges on the two \natoms in a polar covalent bond are denoted \nby symbol δ (delta) and the shift of electron \ndensity is shown by an arrow that points from �δ+ to δ– end of the polar bond.δδ+ δ+ δ−CH3→CH2→Cl2 1 In turn carbon-1, which has developed partial positive charge (δ+) draws some electron density towards it from the adjacent \nC-C bond. Consequently, some positive charge \n(δδ+) develops on carbon-2 also, where δδ+ symbolises relatively smaller positive charge �as compared to that on carbon – 1. In other �words, the polar C – Cl bond induces polarity \nin the adjacent bonds. Such polarisation of  �σ-bond caused by the polarisation of adjacent σ-bond is referred to as the inductive effect. \nThis effect is passed on to the subsequent \nbonds also but the effect decreases rapidly \nas the number of intervening bonds increases \nand becomes vanishingly small after three \nbonds. The inductive effect is related to the \nability of substituent(s) to either withdraw or \ndonate electron density to the attached carbon \natom. Based on this ability, the substitutents \ncan be classified as electron-withdrawing or electron donating groups relative to hydrogen. \nHalogens and many other groups such as \nnitro (- NO2), cyano  (- CN), carboxy (- COOH), ester (COOR), aryloxy (-OAr, e.g. – OC6H5), etc. are electron-withdrawing groups. On the other �hand, the alkyl groups like methyl (–CH3) and ethyl (–CH2–CH3) are usually considered as electron donating groups. Unit 8.indd   27410/10/2022   10:37:34 AM275Problem 8.14Which bond is more polar in the following pairs of molecules: (a) H3C-H, H3C-Br (b) H3C-NH2, H3C-OH (c) H3C-OH,  H3C-SH solution(a) C–Br, since Br is more electronegative than H, (b) C–O, (c) C–O Problem 8.15In which C–C bond of CH3CH2CH2Br, the inductive effect is expected to be the least?solutionMagnitude of inductive effect diminishes as the number of intervening bonds increases. Hence, the effect is least in the \nbond between carbon-3 and hydrogen.8.7.6  resonance structureThere are many organic molecules whose behaviour cannot be explained by a single Lewis structure. An example is that of   benzene. Its cyclic structure �containing alternating  C–C single \nand C=C  double bonds shown \nis inadequate for explaining its \ncharacteristic properties.  As per the above representation, benzene should exhibit two different bond lengths, due to C–C single and C=C double bonds. However, as determined experimentally �benzene has a uniform C–C bond distances \nof 139 pm, a value intermediate between the �C–C single(154 pm) and C=C double (134 \npm) bonds. Thus, the structure of benzene \ncannot be represented adequately by the \nabove structure. Further, benzene can be \nrepresented equally well by the energetically \nidentical structures I and II. benzene cannot be adequately represented by any of these structures, rather it is \na hybrid of the two structures (I and II) \ncalled resonance structures. The resonance structures (canonical structures or �contributing structures) are hypothetical �and individually do not represent any �real molecule. They contribute to the actual \nstructure in proportion to their stability. Another example of resonance is provided by nitromethane (CH3NO2) which can be represented by two Lewis structures, (I and \nII). There are two types of N-O bonds in these \nstructures.        however, it is known that the two n–O bonds of nitromethane are of the same length (intermediate between a n–O single bond and a n=O double bond). the actual structure of nitromethane is therefore a resonance hybrid of the two canonical forms I and II.  The energy of actual structure of the molecule (the resonance hybrid) is lower than that of any of the canonical structures. The difference in energy between the actual structure and the \nlowest energy resonance structure is called the \nresonance stabilisation energy or simply \nthe resonance energy. The more the number of important contributing structures, the \nmore is the resonance energy. Resonance is \nparticularly important when the contributing \nstructures are equivalent in energy. The following rules are applied while writing resonance structures:  The resonance structures have (i) the same positions of nuclei and (ii) the same number of \nunpaired electrons. Among the resonance \nstructures, the one which has more number \nof covalent bonds, all the atoms with octet \nof electrons (except hydrogen which has a \nduplet), less separation of opposite charges, (a \nnegative charge if any on more electronegative \natom, a positive charge if any on more \nelectropositive atom) and more dispersal of \ncharge, is more stable than others.  Benzene Therefore, according to the resonance theory (Unit 4) the actual structure of Unit 8.indd   27510/10/2022   10:37:34 AM276Problem 8.16Write resonance structures of CH3COO– and show the movement of electrons by curved arrows.solutionFirst, write the structure and put unshared pairs of valence electrons on \nappropriate atoms. Then draw the arrows \none at a time moving the electrons to get \nthe other structures.Problem 8.17Write resonance structures of  CH2=CH–CHO. Indicate relative stability of the contributing structures.solutionsolutionThe two structures are less important contributors as they involve charge separation. Additionally, structure \nI contains a carbon atom with an incomplete octet.8.7.7 resonance effectThe resonance effect is defined as ‘the polarity produced in the molecule by the interaction of two π-bonds or between a π-bond and lone pair of electrons present on an adjacent atom’. The effect is transmitted through the \nchain. There are two types of resonance or \nmesomeric effect designated as R or M effect.(i) Positive Resonance Effect (+R effect) \nIn this effect, the transfer of electrons is away from an atom or substituent group attached \nto the conjugated system. This electron \ndisplacement makes certain positions in the \nmolecule of high electron densities. This effect \nin aniline is shown as : Stability: I \u003e II \u003e III[I: Most stable,  more number of covalent \nbonds, each carbon and oxygen atom has \nan octet and no separation of opposite \ncharge II: negative charge on more \nelectronegative atom and positive charge \non more electropositive atom; III: does \nnot contribute as oxygen has positive \ncharge and carbon has negative charge, \nhence least stable].  Problem 8.18Explain why the following two structures, \nI and II cannot be the major contributors \nto the real structure of CH3COOCH3.(ii) Negative Resonance Effect (- R effect)This effect is observed when the transfer of electrons is towards the atom or substituent \ngroup attached to the conjugated system. \nFor example in nitrobenzene this electron \ndisplacement can be depicted as : The atoms or substituent groups, which represent +R or  –R electron displacement effects are as follows : +R effect: – halogen, –OH, –OR, –OCOR, –NH2, –NHR, –NR2, –NHCOR, – R effect: – COOH, –CHO, \u003eC=O, – CN, –NO2 Unit 8.indd   27610/10/2022   10:37:35 AM277The presence of alternate single and double bonds in an open chain or cyclic system is termed as a conjugated system. These \nsystems often show abnormal behaviour. \nThe examples are 1,3- butadiene, aniline \nand nitrobenzene etc. In such systems, the �π-electrons are delocalised and the system develops polarity.8.7.8 electromeric effect (e effect)It is a temporary effect. The organic compounds having a multiple bond (a double or triple bond) show this effect in the presence of \nan attacking reagent only. It is defined as \nthe complete transfer of a shared pair of  π-electrons to one of the atoms joined by a \nmultiple bond on the demand of an attacking \nreagent. The effect is annulled as soon as the \nattacking reagent is removed from the domain \nof the reaction. It is represented by E and the \nshifting of the electrons is shown by a curved \narrow (). There are two distinct types of electromeric effect. \n(i) Positive Eelctromeric Effect (+E effect) In \nthis effect the π−electrons of the multiple \nbond are transferred to that atom to which \nthe reagent gets attached. For example: system or to an atom with an unshared  p orbital. The σ electrons of C—H bond of the alkyl group enter into partial conjugation with \nthe attached unsaturated system or with the \nunshared p orbital. Hyperconjugation is a permanent effect.To understand hyperconjugation effect, let us take an example of CH3 C+H2 (ethyl cation) in which the positively charged carbon atom has \nan empty p orbital. One of the C-H bonds of \nthe methyl group can align in the plane of this \nempty p orbital and the electrons constituting the C-H bond in plane with this p orbital can \nthen be delocalised into the empty p orbital \nas depicted in Fig. 8.4 (a).(ii) Negative Electromeric Effect (–E effect) In \nthis effect the π - electrons of the multiple \nbond are transferred to that atom to which \nthe attacking reagent does not get attached. \nFor example:When inductive and electromeric effects operate in opposite directions, the electomeric \neffect predominates.8.7.9 hyperconjugationHyperconjugation is a general stabilising interaction. It involves delocalisation of  σ electrons of C—H bond of an alkyl group directly attached to an atom of unsaturated Fig. 8.4(a) Orbital diagram showing hyperconjugation in ethyl cationThis type of overlap stabilises the carbocation because electron density from \nthe adjacent σ bond helps in dispersing the \npositive charge. In general, greater the number of alkyl groups attached to a positively charged carbon atom, the greater is the hyperconjugation \ninteraction and stabilisation of the cation. \nThus, we have the following relative stability \nof carbocations :  Unit 8.indd   27710/10/2022   10:37:35 AM278Hyperconjugation is also possible in alkenes and alkylarenes. Delocalisation of electrons by hyperconjugation in the case of alkene can be depicted as in Fig. 8.4(b).Problem 8.19 \nExplain why (CH3)3C+ is more stable than CH3C+H2 and C+H3 is the least stable  cation. solution Hyperconjugation interaction in (CH3)3C+  is greater than in CH3C+H2 as the (CH3)3C+   has nine C-H bonds. In C+H3, vacant p orbital is perpendicular to the plane  in which C-H bonds lie; hence cannot overlap with it. Thus, C+H3 lacks hyperconjugative stability. 8.7.10 types of Organic reactions and MechanismsOrganic reactions can be classified into the following categories:(i) Substitution reactions(ii) Addition reactions(iii) Elimination reactions(iv) Rearrangement reactionsYou will be studying these reactions in  Unit 9 and later in class XII.8.8 methOds OF PuriFicatiOn OF Organic cOmPOundsOnce an organic compound is extracted from a natural source or synthesised in the laboratory, it is essential to purify it. Various  \nmethods used for the purification of organic \ncompounds are based on the nature of the \ncompound and the impurity present in it. The common techniques used for purification are as follows :(i) Sublimation(ii) Crystallisation(iii) Distillation(iv) Differential extraction and(v) Chromatography Finally, the purity of a compound is  ascertained by determining its melting or boiling point. Most of the pure compounds have sharp melting points and boiling points. New methods of checking the purity of an \norganic compound are based on different Fig. 8.4(b) Orbital diagram showing hyperconjugation in propeneThere are various ways of looking at the hyperconjugative effect. One of the way is to \nregard C—H bond as possessing partial ionic \ncharacter due to resonance.The hyperconjugation may also be regarded as no bond resonance.Unit 8.indd   27810/10/2022   10:37:35 AM279types of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques.8.8.1 sublimationYou have learnt earlier that on heating, some solid substances change from solid to vapour state without passing through liquid state. \nThe purification technique based on the above \nprinciple is known as sublimation and is used \nto separate sublimable compounds from non-\nsublimable impurities.8.8.2 crystallisationThis is one of the most commonly used techniques for the purification of solid organic compounds. It is based on the difference in \nthe solubilities of the compound and the \nimpurities in a suitable solvent. The impure \ncompound is dissolved in a solvent in which it \nis sparingly soluble at room temperature but \nappreciably soluble at higher temperature. \nThe solution is concentrated to get a nearly \nsaturated solution. On cooling the solution, \npure compound crystallises out and is \nremoved by filtration. The filtrate (mother \nliquor) contains impurities and small quantity \nof the compound. If the compound is highly \nsoluble in one solvent and very little  soluble \nin another solvent, crystallisation can be \nsatisfactorily carried out in a mixture of these \nsolvents. Impurities, which impart colour to \nthe solution are removed by adsorbing over \nactivated charcoal. Repeated crystallisation \nbecomes necessary for the purification \nof compounds containing impurities of \ncomparable solubilities.8.8.3 distillationThis important method is used to separate (i) volatile liquids from nonvolatile impurities \nand (ii) the liquids having sufficient difference in their boiling points. Liquids having \ndifferent boiling points vaporise at different \ntemperatures. The vapours are cooled and \nthe liquids so formed are collected separately. \nChloroform (b.p 334 K) and aniline (b.p. 457 \nK) are easily separated by the technique of \ndistillation (Fig 8.5). The liquid mixture is \ntaken in a round bottom flask and heated carefully. On boiling, the vapours of lower boiling component are formed first. The \nvapours are condensed by using a condenser \nand the liquid is collected in a receiver.  \nThe vapours of higher boiling component \nform later and the liquid can be collected \nseparately.Fractional Distillation: If the difference in boiling points of two liquids is not much, simple distillation cannot be used to separate \nthem.  The vapours of such liquids are formed \nwithin the same temperature range and are \ncondensed simultaneously.  The technique of \nfractional distillation is used in such cases. In \nthis technique, vapours of a liquid mixture are \npassed through a fractionating column before \ncondensation. The fractionating column is \nfitted over the mouth of the round bottom \nflask (Fig.8.6, page 280).Vapours of the liquid with higher boiling point condense before the vapours of the \nliquid with lower boiling point. The vapours \nrising up in the fractionating column become \nricher in more volatile component. By the Fig.8.5 Simple distillation. The vapours of a substance formed are condensed and the liquid is collected in conical flask.Unit 8.indd   27910/10/2022   10:37:35 AM280time the vapours reach to the top of the fractionating column, these are rich in the \nmore volatile component. Fractionating \ncolumns are available in various sizes and \ndesigns as shown in Fig.8.7. A fractionating \ncolumn provides many surfaces for heat \nexchange between the ascending vapours \nand the descending condensed liquid.  Some \nof the condensing liquid in the fractionating \ncolumn obtains heat from the ascending \nvapours and revaporises.  The vapours thus \nbecome richer in low boiling component.  The \nvapours of low boiling component ascend \nto the top of the column. On reaching the \ntop, the vapours become pure in low boiling \ncomponent and pass through the condenser \nand the pure liquid is collected in a receiver.  \nAfter a series of successive distillations, the \nremaining liquid in the distillation flask gets \nenriched in high boiling component. Each \nsuccessive condensation and vaporisation Fig.8.7 Different types of fractionating columns.unit in the fractionating column is called a theoretical plate.  Commercially, columns with hundreds of plates are available.One of the technological applications of fractional distillation is to separate different \nfractions of crude oil in petroleum industry.Fig.8.6  Fractional distillation. The vapours of lower boiling \nfraction reach the top of the column first followed by \nvapours of higher boiling fractions.Distillation under reduced \npressure: This method is used to purify liquids having \nvery high boiling points and \nthose, which decompose at \nor below their boiling points. \nSuch liquids are made to boil \nat a temperature lower than \ntheir normal boiling points \nby reducing the pressure on \ntheir surface. A liquid boils \nat a temperature at which its \nvapour pressure is equal to \nthe external pressure. The \npressure is reduced with \nthe help of a water pump \nor vacuum pump (Fig.8.8). \nGlycerol can be separated from �spent-lye in soap industry by \nusing this technique.  Unit 8.indd   28010/10/2022   10:37:35 AM281Fig.8.8 Distillation under reduced pressure. A liquid boils at a temperature below its vapour pressure by reducing the pressure.Steam Distillation: This technique is applied to separate substances which are steam volatile and are immiscible with water. \nIn steam distillation, steam from a steam \ngenerator is passed through a heated flask \ncontaining the liquid to be distilled. The \nmixture of steam and the volatile organic \ncompound is condensed and collected. The \ncompound is later separated from water using \na separating funnel. In steam distillation, \nthe liquid boils when the sum of vapour \npressures due to the organic liquid (p1) and that due to water (p2) becomes equal to the atmospheric pressure (p), i.e. p =p1+ p2. Since p1 is lower than p, the organic liquid vaporises at lower temperature than its \nboiling point. Thus, if one of the substances in the mixture is water and the other, a water insoluble substance, then the mixture will boil \nclose to but below, 373K. A mixture of water \nand the substance is obtained which can \nbe separated by using a separating funnel.  \nAniline is separated by this technique from �aniline – water mixture  (Fig.8.9, Page 282).8.8.4 differential extraction When an organic compound is present in an aqueous medium, it is separated by shaking it with an organic solvent in which it is more \nsoluble than in water. The organic solvent and \nthe aqueous solution should be immiscible \nwith each other so that they form two distinct \nlayers which can be separated by separatory \nfunnel. The organic solvent is later removed \nby distillation or by evaporation to get back  the compound. Differential extraction is \ncarried out in a separatory funnel as shown in  Fig. 8.10 (Page 282). If the organic compound \nis less soluble in the organic solvent, a very \nlarge quantity of solvent would be required \nto extract even a very small quantity of the \ncompound. The technique of continuous \nextraction is employed in such cases. In this \ntechnique same solvent is repeatedly used for \nextraction of the compound.  8.8.5  chromatographyChromatography is an important technique extensively used to separate mixtures into their components, purify compounds and \nalso to test the purity of compounds. The Unit 8.indd   28110/10/2022   10:37:36 AM282name chromatography is based on the Greek word chroma, for colour since the method was first used for the separation of coloured \nsubstances found in plants. In this technique, \nthe mixture of substances is applied onto a \nstationary phase, which may be a solid or a \nliquid. A pure solvent, a mixture of solvents, \nor a gas is allowed to move slowly over the \nstationary phase. The components of the mixture get gradually separated from one \nanother. The moving phase is called the \nmobile phase.Based on the principle involved, chromatography is classified into different \ncategories. Two of these are:(a) Adsorption chromatography, and (b) Partition chromatography.  a) Adsorption Chromatography: Adsor-ption chromatography is based on the fact that different compounds are adsorbed on \nan adsorbent to different degrees. Commonly \nused adsorbents are silica gel and alumina.  \nWhen a mobile phase is allowed to move  over a stationary phase (adsorbent), the \ncomponents of the mixture move by varying distances over the stationary phase. Following \nare two main types of chromatographic \ntechniques based on the principle of differential \nadsorption.  (a)  Column chromatography, and (b) Thin layer chromatography.Fig.8.10 Differential extraction. Extraction of com-pound takes place based on difference in solubility Fig.8.9  Steam distillation.  Steam volatile component volatilizes, the vapours condense in the condenser and the liquid collects in conical flask.Unit 8.indd   28210/10/2022   10:37:36 AM283Column Chromatography: Column chromatography involves separation of \na mixture over a  column of adsorbent \n(stationary phase) packed in a glass tube. \nThe column is fitted with a stopcock at its \nlower end (Fig. 8.11).  The mixture adsorbed \non adsorbent is placed on the top of the \nadsorbent column packed in a glass tube.  \nAn appropriate eluant which is a liquid or a \nmixture of liquids is allowed to flow down the \ncolumn slowly.  Depending upon the degree to \nwhich the compounds are adsorbed, complete \nseparation takes place.  The most readily \nadsorbed substances are retained near the top \nand others come down to various distances \nin the column (Fig.8.11).The glass plate is then placed in a closed jar \ncontaining the eluant (Fig. 8.12a). As the \neluant rises up the plate, the components of \nthe mixture move up along with the eluant to \ndifferent distances depending on their degree \nof adsorption and separation takes place. \nThe relative adsorption of each component \nof the mixture is expressed in terms of its \nretardation factor i.e. Rf value (Fig.8.12 b).Rf  = Distance moved by the substance from base line (x)       Distance moved by the solvent from base line (y)Fig.8.11   Column chromatography. Different stages of separation of components \nof a mixture.Thin Layer Chromatography: Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is another type of \nadsorption chromatography, which involves \nseparation of substances of a mixture over \na thin layer of an adsorbent coated on glass \nplate.  A thin layer (about 0.2mm thick) of \nan adsorbent (silica gel or alumina) is spread \nover a glass plate of suitable size. The plate \nis known as thin layer chromatography plate \nor chromaplate. The solution of the mixture \nto be separated is applied as a small spot \nabout 2 cm above one end of the TLC plate.  The spots of coloured compounds are visible on TLC plate due to their original colour.  \nThe spots of colourless compounds, which are \ninvisible to the eye but fluoresce in ultraviolet \nlight, can be detected by putting the plate under \nultraviolet light. Another detection technique \nis to place the plate in a covered jar containing \na few crystals of iodine. Spots of compounds, \nwhich adsorb iodine, will show up as brown \nspots.  Sometimes an appropriate reagent \nmay also be sprayed on the plate. For example, \namino acids may be detected by spraying the \nplate with ninhydrin solution (Fig.8.12b).

The spots of the separated colourless compounds may be observed either under ultraviolet light or by \nthe use of an appropriate spray reagent as \ndiscussed under thin layer chromatography.  8.9 qualitatiVe analysis OF Organic cOmPOundsThe elements present in organic compounds are carbon and hydrogen. In addition to these, they may also contain oxygen, nitrogen, \nsulphur, halogens and phosphorus.8.9.1  detection of carbon and hydrogenCarbon and hydrogen are detected by heating the compound with copper(II) oxide.

This extract is known as sodium fusion \nextract.(A) Test for Nitrogen \nThe sodium fusion extract is boiled with  iron(II) sulphate and then acidified with Partition Chromatography: Partition chromatography is based on continuous \ndifferential partitioning of components of \na mixture between stationary and mobile \nphases. Paper chromatography is a type \nof partition chromatography. In paper \nchromatography, a special quality paper \nknown as chromatography paper is used. \nChromatography paper contains water trapped \nin it, which acts as the stationary phase.A strip of chromatography paper spotted at the base with the solution of the mixture is suspended in a suitable solvent or a mixture \nof solvents (Fig. 8.13). This solvent acts as the \nmobile phase. The solvent rises up the paper \nby capillary action and flows over the spot. The \npaper selectively retains different components \naccording to their differing partition in the \ntwo phases.   The paper strip so developed is \nknown as a chromatogram.  The spots of the \nseparated coloured compounds are visible at \ndifferent heights from the position of initial Fig.8.13 Paper chromatography.

Sodium cyanide first reacts  with iron(II)sulphate and forms sodium \nhexacyanidoferrate(II). On heating with \nconcentrated sulphuric acid some iron(II) \nions are oxidised to iron(III) ions which \nreact with sodium hexacyanidoferrate(II) \nto produce iron(III) hexacyanidoferrate(II) \n(ferriferrocyanide) which is Prussian blue in \ncolour. 6CN– + Fe2+  →   [Fe(CN)6]4– 3[Fe(CN)6]4– + 4Fe3+  Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3.xH2O Prussian blue(B) Test for Sulphur (a)  The sodium fusion extract is acidified with acetic acid and lead acetate is added \nto it.

It helps chemists in the determination of mass per \ncent of elements present in a compound. You \nhave learnt in Unit-1 that mass per cent of \nelements is required for the determination of \nemperical and molecular formula.The percentage composition of elements present in an organic compound is determined \nby the following methods:8.10.1  carbon and Hydrogen Both carbon and hydrogen are estimated in one experiment. A known mass of an organic compound is burnt in the presence of  excess \nof oxygen and copper(II) oxide.

These tubes are connected in series \n(Fig. 8.14). The increase in masses of calcium \nchloride and potassium hydroxide gives the \namounts of water and carbon dioxide from \nwhich the percentages of carbon and hydrogen are calculated.Let the mass of organic compound be  m g, mass of water and carbon dioxide \nproduced be m1 and m2 g respectively;Percentage of carbon=  21210044mm×××Percentage of hydrogen  = 1210018mm×××  Problem 8.20 \nOn complete combustion, 0.246 g of an \norganic compound gave 0.198g of carbon \ndioxide and 0.1014g of water.

The nature of the covalent bonding \nin organic compounds can be described in terms of orbitals hybridisation concept, \naccording to which carbon can have sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised orbitals. The sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised carbons are found in compounds like methane, ethene and ethyne respectively. \nThe tetrahedral shape of methane, planar shape of ethene and linear shape of ethyne can \nbe understood on the basis of this concept. A sp3 hybrid orbital can overlap with 1s orbital of hydrogen to give a carbon - hydrogen (C–H) single bond (sigma, σ bond). Overlap of a sp2 orbital of one carbon with sp2 orbital of another results in the formation of a carbon–carbon σ bond. The unhybridised p orbitals on two adjacent carbons can undergo lateral (side-\nby-side) overlap to give a pi (π) bond. Organic compounds can be represented by various \nstructural formulas. The three dimensional representation of organic compounds on paper \ncan be drawn by wedge and dash formula.Organic compounds can be classified on the basis of their structure or the functional groups they contain. A functional group is an atom or group of atoms bonded together in a \nunique fashion and which determines the physical and  chemical properties of the compounds. \nThe naming of the organic compounds is carried out by following a set of rules laid down by \nthe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (iuPac). In IUPAC nomenclature, the names are correlated with the structure in such a way that the reader can deduce the structure from the name.Organic reaction mechanism concepts are based on the structure of the substrate molecule, fission of a covalent bond, the attacking reagents, the electron displacement effects \nand the conditions of the reaction. These organic reactions involve breaking and making \nof covalent bonds. A covalent bond may be cleaved in heterolytic or homolytic fashion. \nA heterolytic cleavage yields carbocations or carbanions, while a homolytic cleavage gives �free radicals as reactive intermediate. Reactions proceeding through heterolytic cleavage \ninvolve the complimentary pairs of reactive species. These are electron pair donor known as �nucleophile and an electron pair acceptor known as electrophile. The inductive, resonance, electromeric and hyperconjugation effects may help in the polarisation of a bond making certain carbon atom or other atom positions as places of low or high electron densities.Organic reactions can be broadly classified into following types; substitution, addition, elimination and rearrangement reactions. Purification, qualitative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds are carried out for determining their structures. The methods of purification namely : sublimation, distillation \nand differential extraction are based on the difference in one or more physical properties. \nChromatography is a useful technique of separation, identification and purification of \ncompounds. It is classified into two categories : adsorption and partition chromatography. \nAdsorption chromatography is based on differential adsorption of various components of a \nmixture on an adsorbent. Partition chromatography involves continuous partitioning of the \ncomponents of a mixture between stationary and mobile phases. After getting the compound \nin a pure form, its qualitative analysis is carried out for detection of elements present in it. \nNitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus are detected by lassaigne’s test. Carbon and hydrogen are estimated by determining the amounts of carbon dioxide and water produced. Nitrogen is estimated by dumas or Kjeldahl’s method and halogens by Carius method.
