    "input": "The Periodic Table is arguably the most important concept in chemistry, both in principle and in practice. It is the \neveryday support for students, it suggests new avenues \nof research to professionals, and it provides a succinct \norganization of the whole of chemistry. It is a remarkable \ndemonstration of the fact that the chemical elements are \nnot a random cluster of entities but instead display trends \nand lie together in families. An awareness of the Periodic \nTable is essential to anyone who wishes to disentangle \nthe world and see how it is built up from the fundamental \nbuilding blocks of the chemistry, the chemical elements. Glenn T. SeaborgUNIT 3CLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS AND PERIODICITY IN PROPERTIESAfter studying this Unit, you will be able to •\tappreciate how the concept of grouping elements in accordance \nto their properties led to the \ndevelopment of Periodic Table.•\tunderstand  the Periodic Law; •\tunderstand\tthe\t\tsignificance\tof\tatomic number and electronic \nconfiguration as the basis for �periodic\tclassification;•\tname the elements with  Z \u003e100 according to IUPAC nomenclature; •\tclassify elements into s, p, d, f blocks and learn their main characteristics;•\trecognise the periodic trends in \nphysical and chemical properties \nof elements;•\tcompare the reactivity of elements \nand correlate it with their \noccurrence in nature;•\texplain the relationship  between \nionization enthalpy and metallic \ncharacter;•\tuse  scientific  vocabulary \nappropriately to communicate \nideas related to certain important \nproperties of atoms e.g., \natomic/ionic radii, ionization \nenthalpy, electron gain enthalpy, \nelectronegativity, valence of \nelements. In this Unit, we will study the historical development of the \nPeriodic Table as it stands today and the Modern Periodic �Law.\tWe\twill\talso\tlearn\thow\tthe\tperiodic\tclassification\tfollows as a logical consequence of the electronic configuration\tof\tatoms.\tFinally,\twe\tshall\texamine\tsome\tof\tthe periodic trends in the physical and chemical properties of the elements.3.1 WHY DO WE NEED TO CLASSIFY ELEMENTS ?We know by now that the elements are the basic units of all types of matter. In 1800, only 31 elements were known. By\t\t1865,\tthe\tnumber\tof\tidentified\telements\thad\tmore\tthan\tdoubled to 63. At present 114 elements are known. Of them, the recently discovered elements are man-made. \nEfforts to synthesise new elements are continuing. With �such\ta\tlarge\tnumber\tof\telements\tit\tis\tvery\tdifficult\tto\tstudy individually the chemistry of all these elements and their innumerable compounds individually. To ease out \nthis problem, scientists searched for a systematic way to \norganise their knowledge by classifying the elements. Not \nonly that it would rationalize known chemical facts about \nelements, but even predict new ones for undertaking \nfurther study. Unit 3.indd   749/9/2022   4:36:12 PM753.2 GENESIS OF PERIODIC CLASSIFICATIONClassification\tof\telements\tinto\tgroups\tand\tdevelopment of Periodic Law and Periodic Table are the consequences of systematising the knowledge gained by a number of \nscientists through their observations and \nexperiments. The German chemist, Johann �Dobereiner\tin\tearly\t1800’s\twas\tthe\tfirst\tto\tconsider the idea of trends among properties \nof elements. By 1829 he noted a similarity \namong the physical and chemical properties \nof several groups of three elements (Triads). In each case, he noticed that the middle  element  of each of the Triads had an atomic weight about half way between the atomic weights of the other two (Table 3.1). Also the properties \nof the middle element were in between those \nof the other two members. Since Dobereiner’s the periodic recurrence of properties. This \nalso did not attract much attention. The \nEnglish chemist, John Alexander Newlands \nin 1865 profounded the Law of Octaves. He arranged the elements in increasing order \nof their atomic weights and noted that every eighth element had properties similar to the �first\telement\t(Table\t3.2).\tThe\trelationship\twas\tjust like every eighth note that resembles the �first\tin\toctaves\tof\tmusic.\tNewlands’s\tLaw\tof\tOctaves seemed to be true only for elements \nup to calcium. Although his idea was not widely accepted at that time, he, for his work, \nwas later awarded Davy Medal in 1887 by the \nRoyal Society, London.The Periodic Law, as we know it today owes its development to the Russian chemist, \nDmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) and the \nGerman chemist, Lothar Meyer (1830-1895).

The next reported attempt to classify elements was made by a �French\tgeologist,\tA.E.B.\tde\tChancourtois\tin\t1862. He arranged the then known elements \nin order of increasing atomic weights and \nmade a cylindrical table of elements to display Working independently, both the chemists in \n1869 proposed that on arranging elements in  the increasing order of their atomic weights, \nsimilarities appear in physical and chemical \nproperties at regular intervals. Lothar Meyer \nplotted the physical properties such as \natomic volume, melting point and boiling \npoint against atomic weight and obtained Unit 3.indd   759/9/2022   4:36:12 PM76a periodically repeated pattern. Unlike Newlands, Lothar Meyer observed a change \nin length of that repeating pattern. By 1868, \nLothar Meyer had developed a table of the \nelements that closely resembles the Modern \nPeriodic Table. However, his work was not \npublished until after the work of Dmitri \nMendeleev, the scientist who is generally \ncredited with the development of the Modern \nPeriodic Table.While Dobereiner initiated the study of periodic relationship, it was Mendeleev who \nwas responsible for publishing the Periodic �Law\tfor\tthe\tfirst\ttime.\tIt\tstates\tas\tfollows\t:The properties of the elements are a periodic function of their atomic \nweights.Mendeleev arranged elements in horizontal \nrows and vertical columns of a table in order \nof their increasing atomic weights in such a \nway that the elements with similar properties \noccupied the same vertical column or group. \nMendeleev’s system of classifying elements \nwas more elaborate than that of Lothar �Meyer’s.\tHe\tfully\trecognized\tthe\tsignificance\tof periodicity and used broader range of physical and chemical properties to classify \nthe elements. In particular, Mendeleev relied \non the similarities in the empirical formulas \nand properties of the compounds formed by \nthe elements. He realized that some of the �elements\tdid\tnot\tfit\tin\twith\this\tscheme\tof\tclassification\tif\tthe\torder\tof\tatomic\tweight\twas strictly followed. He ignored the order of atomic weights, thinking that the atomic measurements might be incorrect, and placed \nthe elements with similar properties together. �For\texample,\tiodine\twith\tlower\tatomic\tweight\tthan that of tellurium (Group VI) was placed in\tGroup\tVII\talong\twith\tfluorine,\tchlorine,\tbromine because of similarities in properties �(Fig.\t3.1).\tAt\tthe\tsame\ttime,\tkeeping\this\tprimary aim of arranging the elements of similar properties in the same group, he \nproposed that some of the elements were \nstill undiscovered and, therefore, left several �gaps\tin\tthe\ttable.\tFor\texample,\tboth\tgallium\tand germanium were unknown at the time Mendeleev published his Periodic Table. He left the gap under aluminium and a gap \nunder silicon, and called these elements \nEka-Aluminium and Eka-Silicon. Mendeleev predicted not only the existence of gallium and germanium, but also described some of their \ngeneral physical properties.  These elements \nwere discovered later. Some of the properties \npredicted by Mendeleev for these elements \nand those found experimentally are listed in  Table 3.3. The boldness of Mendeleev’s quantitative predictions and their eventual success \nmade him and his Periodic Table famous. \nMendeleev’s Periodic Table published in 1905 �is\tshown\tin\tFig.\t3.1.Table 3.3 Mendeleev’s Predictions for the Elements Eka-aluminium (Gallium) and  Eka-silicon (Germanium)PropertyEka-aluminium (predicted)Gallium (found)Eka-silicon (predicted)Germanium (found)Atomic weight68707272.6Density/(g/cm3)5.95.945.55.36Melting point/KLow302.93High1231Formula of oxideE2O3Ga2O3EO2GeO2Formula of chlorideE Cl3GaCl3ECl4GeCl4Unit 3.indd   769/9/2022   4:36:12 PM77PERIODIC\tSYSTEM\tOF\tTHE\tELEMENTS\tIN\tGROUPS\tAND\tSERIESFig. 3.1  Mendeleev’s Periodic Table published earlierUnit 3.indd   779/9/2022   4:36:12 PM783.3 MODERN PERIODIC LAW AND THE PRESENT FORM OF THE PERIODIC TABLEWe must bear in mind that when Mendeleev developed his Periodic Table, chemists knew nothing about the internal structure of atom. However, the beginning of the 20th century witnessed profound developments \nin theories about sub-atomic particles. In 1913, the English physicist, Henry Moseley \nobserved regularities in the characteristic \nX-ray spectra of the elements. A plot of  (where \tis frequency of X-rays emitted) against atomic number (Z) gave a straight line and not the plot of  vs atomic mass. He thereby showed that the atomic number is a more fundamental property of an element \nthan its atomic mass. Mendeleev’s Periodic Law\twas,\ttherefore,\taccordingly\tmodified.\tThis\tis known as the Modern Periodic Law and can\tbe\tstated\tas\t:The physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic functions \nof their atomic numbers.The Periodic Law revealed important analogies among the 94 naturally occurring elements (neptunium and plutonium like \nactinium and protoactinium are also found \nin pitch blende – an ore of uranium). It \nstimulated renewed interest in Inorganic \nChemistry and has carried into the present \nwith the creation of artificially produced \nshort-lived elements.You may recall that the atomic number is equal to the nuclear charge (i.e., number of protons) or the number of electrons in \na neutral atom. It is then easy to visualize �the\tsignificance\tof\tquantum\tnumbers\tand\telectronic\tconfigurations\tin\tperiodicity\tof\telements. In fact, it is now recognized that the Periodic Law is essentially the consequence \nof the periodic variation in electronic �configurations,\twhich\tindeed\tdetermine\tthe\tphysical and chemical properties of elements and their compounds.Numerous forms of Periodic Table have been devised from time to time. Some forms emphasise chemical reactions and valence, whereas others stress the electronic �configuration\tof\telements.\tA\tmodern\tversion,\tthe so-called “long form” of the Periodic Table\tof\tthe\telements\t(Fig.\t3.2),\tis\tthe\tmost\tconvenient and widely used. The horizontal \nrows (which Mendeleev called series) are called periods and the vertical columns, groups. Elements having similar outer \nelectronic configurations in their atoms \nare arranged in vertical columns, referred \nto as groups or families. According to the recommendation of International Union of \nPure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the \ngroups are numbered from 1 to 18 replacing \nthe older notation of groups IA …  VIIA, VIII, \nIB …  VIIB and 0.There are altogether seven periods. The period number corresponds to the highest principal quantum number (n) of the elements in\tthe\tperiod.\tThe\tfirst\tperiod\tcontains\t2\telements. The subsequent periods consists of 8, 8, 18, 18 and 32 elements, respectively. The \nseventh period is incomplete and like the sixth \nperiod would have a theoretical maximum \n(on the basis of quantum numbers) of 32 \nelements. In this form of the Periodic Table, \n14 elements of both sixth and seventh periods \n(lanthanoids and actinoids, respectively) are \nplaced in separate panels at the bottom*.3.4 NOMENCLATURE OF ELEMENTS WITH ATOMIC NUMBERS \u003e 100The naming of the new elements had been traditionally the privilege of the discoverer \n(or discoverers) and the suggested name was �ratified\tby\tthe\tIUPAC.\tIn\trecent\tyears\tthis\thas\tled to some controversy. The new elements \nwith very high atomic numbers are so unstable that only minute quantities, sometimes only * Glenn T. Seaborgs work in the middle of the 20th century starting with the discovery of plutonium in 1940, followed by those of all the transuranium elements from 94 to 102 led to reconﬁguration of the periodic table placing the actinoids below the lanthanoids. In 1951, Seaborg was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work. Element 106 has been named \nSeaborgium (Sg) in his honour.Unit 3.indd   789/9/2022   4:36:13 PM79Fig. 3.2  Long form of the Periodic Table of the Elements with their atomic numbers and ground state outer electronic configurations. The groups are numbered 1-18 in accordance with the 1984 IUPAC recommendations. This notation replaces the old numbering scheme of  IA–VIIA, VIII, IB–VIIB and 0 for the elements.

Their synthesis and characterisation, therefore, \nrequire highly sophisticated costly equipment \nand laboratory. Such work is carried out with \ncompetitive spirit only in some laboratories \nin the world. Scientists, before collecting the \nreliable data on the new element, at times �get\ttempted\tto\tclaim\tfor\tits\tdiscovery.\tFor\texample, both American and Soviet scientists claimed credit for discovering element 104. The Americans named it Rutherfordium \nwhereas Soviets named it Kurchatovium. To \navoid such problems, the IUPAC has made \nrecommendation that until a new element’s �discovery\tis\tproved,\tand\tits\tname\tis\tofficially\trecognised, a systematic nomenclature be \nderived directly from the atomic number of the element using the numerical roots for \n0 and numbers 1-9. These are shown in  Table 3.4. The roots are put together in order of digits which make up the atomic number and “ium” is added at the end. The IUPAC names \nfor elements with Z above 100 are shown in  Table 3.5.Table 3.5  Nomenclature of Elements with Atomic Number Above 100AtomicNumberName according toIUPAC nomenclatureSymbolIUPACOfficial NameIUPACSymbol101102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n117\n118Unnilunium\nUnnilbium\nUnniltrium\nUnnilquadium\nUnnilpentium\nUnnilhexium\nUnnilseptium\nUnniloctium\nUnnilennium\nUnunnillium\nUnununnium\nUnunbium\nUnuntrium\nUnunquadium\nUnunpentium\nUnunhexium\nUnunseptium\nUnunoctiumUnuUnbUntUnqUnpUnhUnsUnoUneUunUuuUubUutUuqUupUuhUusUuoMendelevium\nNobelium\nLawrencium\nRutherfordium\nDubnium\nSeaborgium\nBohrium\nHassium\nMeitnerium\nDarmstadtium\nRontgenium\nCopernicium\nNihonium�Flerovium\nMoscovium\nLivermorium\nTennessine\nOganessonMdNoLr\nRfDbSgBhHsMtDsRgCn NhFlMcLvTsOgTable 3.4 Notation for IUPAC Nomenclature of ElementsDigitNameAbbreviation01\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9nilunbitriquadpenthexseptoctennnubtqphsoeUnit 3.indd   809/9/2022   4:36:13 PM81Thus, the new element first gets a temporary name, with symbol consisting of three letters.

Hence, \nthe symbol and the name respectively \nare Ubn and unbinilium.3.5 ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS OF ELEMENTS AND THE PERIODIC TABLEIn the preceding unit we have learnt that an electron in an atom is characterised by a set \nof four quantum numbers, and the principal \nquantum number (n\t)\tdefines\tthe\tmain\tenergy\tlevel known as shell. We have also studied about\tthe\tfilling\tof\telectrons\tinto\tdifferent\tsubshells, also referred to as orbitals (s, p, \nd, f) in an atom. The distribution of electrons into orbitals of an atom is called its electronic configuration. An element’s location in the �Periodic\tTable\treflects\tthe\tquantum\tnumbers\tof\tthe\tlast\torbital\tfilled.\tIn\tthis\tsection\twe\twill observe a direct connection between the �electronic\tconfigurations\tof\tthe\telements\tand\tthe long form of the Periodic Table.(a)  Electronic Configurations in PeriodsThe period indicates the value of n for the outermost or valence shell. In other words, successive period in the Periodic Table is �associated\twith\tthe\tfilling\tof\tthe\tnext\thigher\tprincipal energy level (n = 1, n = 2, etc.). It can be readily seen that the number of elements in each period is twice the number of atomic \norbitals available in the energy level that is �being\tfilled.\tThe\tfirst\tperiod\t(n = 1) starts with the\tfilling\tof\tthe\tlowest\tlevel\t(1s) and therefore has two elements — hydrogen (ls1) and helium (ls2)\twhen\tthe\tfirst\tshell\t(K) is completed. The second period (n = 2) starts with lithium and the third electron enters the 2s orbital. The next \nelement, beryllium has four electrons and has �the\telectronic\tconfiguration\t1s22s2. Starting from the next element boron, the 2p orbitals �are\tfilled\twith\telectrons\twhen\tthe\tL shell is completed at neon (2s22p6). Thus there are  8 elements in the second period. The third \nperiod (n = 3) begins at sodium, and the added electron enters a 3s\torbital.\tSuccessive\tfilling\tof 3s and 3p orbitals gives rise to the third period of 8 elements from sodium to argon. The \nfourth period (n = 4) starts at potassium, and �the\tadded\telectrons\tfill\tup\tthe\t4s orbital. Now you may note that before the 4p\torbital\tis\tfilled,\tfilling\tup\tof\t3d orbitals becomes energetically favourable and we come across the so called 3d transition series of elements. This starts from \nscandium (Z = 21) which has the electronic configuration\t3d14s2. The 3d\torbitals\tare\tfilled\tat zinc (Z=30)\twith\telectronic\tconfiguration\t 3d104s2. The fourth period ends at krypton with\tthe\tfilling\tup\tof\tthe\t4p orbitals. Altogether we have 18 elements in this fourth period. The fifth\tperiod\t(n = 5) beginning with rubidium is similar to the fourth period and contains \nthe 4d transition series starting at yttrium  (Z = 39). This period ends at xenon with the �filling\tup\tof\tthe\t5p orbitals. The sixth period  (n = 6) contains 32 elements and successive electrons enter 6s, 4f, 5d and 6p orbitals, in �the\torder\t—\tfilling\tup\tof\tthe\t4f orbitals begins with cerium (Z = 58) and ends at lutetium  (Z = 71) to give the 4f-inner transition series \nwhich is called the lanthanoid series. The \nseventh period (n = 7) is similar to the sixth �period\twith\tthe\tsuccessive\tfilling\tup\tof\tthe\t7s, 5f, 6d and 7p orbitals and includes most of the man-made radioactive elements. This \nperiod will end at the element with atomic \nnumber 118 which would belong to the noble gas family.\tFilling\tup\tof\tthe\t5f orbitals after Unit 3.indd   819/9/2022   4:36:13 PM82actinium (Z = 89) gives the 5f-inner transition series known as the actinoid series. The 4f- and 5f-inner transition series of elements \nare placed separately in the Periodic Table \nto maintain its structure and to preserve the �principle\tof\tclassification\tby\tkeeping\telements\twith similar properties in a single column.Problem 3.2How would you justify the presence of 18 elements in the 5th period of the Periodic Table?SolutionWhen n = 5, l = 0, 1, 2, 3. The order in which the energy of the available orbitals 4d, 5s and 5p increases is 5s \n\u003c 4d \u003c 5p. The total number of orbitals available are 9. The maximum number \nof electrons that can be accommodated \nis 18; and therefore 18 elements are there in the 5th period.(b) Groupwise Electronic ConfigurationsElements in the same vertical column or group have similar valence shell electronic �configurations,\tthe\tsame\tnumber\tof\telectrons\tin the outer orbitals, and similar properties. �For\texample,\tthe\tGroup\t1\telements\t(alkali\tmetals) all have ns1 valence shell electronic configuration\tas\tshown\tbelow.a theoretical foundation for the periodic classification.\tThe\telements\tin\ta\tvertical\tcolumn\tof the Periodic Table constitute a group or family and exhibit similar chemical behaviour. \nThis similarity arises because these elements \nhave the same number and same distribution \nof electrons in their outermost orbitals. We \ncan classify the elements into four blocks viz.,   \ns-block, p-block, d-block and f-block depending on the type of atomic orbitals that �are\tbeing\tfilled\twith\telectrons.\tThis\tis\tillustrated\tin\tFig.\t3.3.\tWe\tnotice\ttwo\texceptions\tto\tthis\tcategorisation. Strictly, helium belongs to the  s-block but its positioning in the p-block along with other group 18 elements is �justified\tbecause\tit\thas\ta\tcompletely\tfilled\tvalence shell (1s2) and as a result, exhibits properties characteristic of other noble gases. \nThe other exception is hydrogen. It has only \none s-electron and hence can be placed in  group 1 (alkali metals). It can also \ngain an electron to achieve a noble gas \narrangement and hence it can behave \nsimilar to a group 17 (halogen family) \nelements. Because it is a special case, we \nshall place hydrogen separately at the top of �the\tPeriodic\tTable\tas\tshown\tin\tFig.\t3.2\tand\t Fig.\t3.3.\tWe\twill\tbriefly\tdiscuss\tthe\tsalient\tfeatures of the four types of elements marked in the Periodic Table. More about these elements Thus it can be seen that the properties of an element have periodic dependence upon its atomic number and not on relative atomic mass.3.6 ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS AND TYPES OF ELEMENTS:  S-, P-, D-, F- BLOCKSThe aufbau (build up) principle and the electronic configuration of atoms provide will be discussed later.

Also shown is the broad division of elements into METALS (                       ), NON-METALS (            ) and METALLOIDS (      ).Unit 3.indd   8311/2/2022   4:28:19 PM84reactive metals with low ionization enthalpies. They lose the outermost electron(s) readily to \nform 1+ ion (in the case of alkali metals) or 2+ \nion (in the case of alkaline earth metals). The \nmetallic character and the reactivity increase \nas we go down the group. Because of high \nreactivity they are never found pure in nature. \nThe compounds of the s-block elements, with the exception of those of lithium and beryllium \nare predominantly ionic.3.6.2 The p-Block ElementsThe p-Block Elements comprise those belonging to Group 13 to 18 and these together with the s-Block Elements are \ncalled the Representative Elements or Main \nGroup Elements. The outermost electronic �configuration varies from ns2np1 to ns2np6 in each period. At the end of each period is \na noble gas element with a closed valence \nshell ns2np6 configuration. All the orbitals in the valence shell of the noble gases are �completely filled by electrons and it is very �difficult to alter this stable arrangement by \nthe addition or removal of electrons. The \nnoble gases thus exhibit very low chemical \nreactivity. Preceding the noble gas family \nare two chemically important groups of non-\nmetals. They are the halogens (Group 17) and \nthe chalcogens (Group 16). These two groups of elements have highly negative electron \ngain enthalpies and readily add one or two \nelectrons respectively to attain the stable �noble gas configuration. The non-metallic \ncharacter increases as we move from left to \nright across a period and metallic character \nincreases as we go down the group.3.6.3 The d-Block Elements (Transition   Elements)These are the elements of Group 3 to 12 in the centre of the Periodic Table. These are �characterised by the filling of inner d orbitals by electrons and are therefore referred to as  d-Block Elements. These elements have \nthe general outer electronic configuration  (n-1)d1-10ns0-2 except for Pd where its electronic configuration is 4d105s0.. They are all metals. They mostly form coloured ions, exhibit variable valence (oxidation states), paramagnetism and oftenly used as catalysts. However, Zn, Cd and Hg which have the electronic configuration, \n(n-1) d10ns2 do not show most of the properties of transition elements. In a way, transition \nmetals form a bridge between the chemically \nactive metals of s-block elements and the \nless active elements of Groups 13 and 14 and \nthus take their familiar name “Transition \nElements”.3.6.4 The f-Block Elements   (Inner-Transition Elements)The two rows of elements at the bottom of the Periodic Table, called the Lanthanoids,  \nCe(Z = 58) – Lu(Z = 71) and Actinoids,  Th(Z = 90) – Lr (Z = 103) are characterised by the outer electronic configuration (n-2)f1-14 (n-1)d0–1ns2. The last electron added to each element is filled in f- orbital. These two series of elements are hence called the Inner-\nTransition Elements (f-Block Elements). They are all metals. Within each series, the \nproperties of the elements are quite similar. \nThe chemistry of the early actinoids is \nmore complicated than the corresponding \nlanthanoids, due to the large number of \noxidation states possible for these actinoid \nelements. Actinoid elements are radioactive. \nMany of the actinoid elements have been made \nonly in nanogram quantities or even less by \nnuclear reactions and their chemistry is not \nfully studied. The elements after uranium are called Transuranium Elements.Problem 3.3The elements  Z = 117 and 120 have not yet been discovered. In which family/group would you place these elements and also give the electronic configuration in \neach case.SolutionWe see from Fig. 3.2, that element with Z = 117, would belong to the halogen family (Group 17) and the �electronic configuration would be [Rn] \n5f146d107s27p5.

The elements can be divided into Metals and Non-Metals. Metals comprise more than 78% of all known elements and appear on \nthe left side of the Periodic Table. Metals are usually solids at room temperature [mercury is an exception; gallium and caesium also \nhave very low melting points (303K and \n302K, respectively)]. Metals usually have high \nmelting and boiling points. They are good \nconductors of heat and electricity. They are �malleable\t(can\tbe\tflattened\tinto\tthin\tsheets\tby\thammering) and ductile (can be drawn into wires). In contrast, non-metals are located at \nthe top right hand side of the Periodic Table. In fact, in a horizontal row, the property of elements change from metallic on the left to \nnon-metallic on the right. Non-metals are \nusually solids or gases at room temperature \nwith low melting and boiling points (boron \nand carbon are exceptions). They are poor \nconductors of heat and electricity. Most non-\nmetallic solids are brittle and are neither \nmalleable nor ductile. The elements become \nmore metallic as we go down a group; the \nnon-metallic character increases as one goes \nfrom left to right across the Periodic Table. The change from metallic to non-metallic \ncharacter is not abrupt as shown by the thick zig-zag\tline\tin\tFig.\t3.3.\tThe\telements\t(e.g.,\tsilicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and \ntellurium) bordering this line and running \ndiagonally across the Periodic Table show properties that are characteristic of both metals and non-metals. These elements are \ncalled Semi-metals or Metalloids.Problem 3.4Considering the atomic number and position in the periodic table, arrange \nthe following elements in the increasing �order\tof\tmetallic\tcharacter\t:\tSi,\tBe,\tMg,\tNa, P.SolutionMetallic character increases down a group and decreases along a period as \nwe move from left to right. Hence the \norder of increasing metallic character �is:\tP\t\u003c\tSi\t\u003c\tBe\t\u003c\tMg\t\u003c\tNa.3.7 PERIODIC TRENDS IN PROPERTIES OF ELEMENTSThere are many observable patterns in the physical and chemical properties of elements as we descend in a group or move across a �period\tin\tthe\tPeriodic\tTable.\tFor\texample,\twithin a period, chemical reactivity tends to \nbe high in Group 1 metals, lower in elements \ntowards the middle of the table, and increases \nto a maximum in the Group 17 non-metals. \nLikewise within a group of representative metals (say alkali metals) reactivity increases \non moving down the group, whereas within a \ngroup of non-metals (say halogens), reactivity \ndecreases down the group. But why do the \nproperties of elements follow these trends? \nAnd how can we explain periodicity? To \nanswer these questions, we must look into the \ntheories of atomic structure and properties \nof the atom. In this section we shall discuss \nthe periodic trends in certain physical and \nchemical properties and try to explain them \nin terms of number of electrons and energy \nlevels.3.7.1 Trends in Physical PropertiesThere are numerous physical properties of elements such as melting and boiling points, heats of fusion and vaporization, energy \nof atomization, etc. which show periodic \nvariations. However, we shall discuss the \nperiodic trends with respect to atomic and \nionic radii, ionization enthalpy, electron gain \nenthalpy and electronegativity.(a) Atomic RadiusYou\tcan\tvery\twell\timagine\tthat\tfinding\tthe\tsize of an atom is a lot more complicated than measuring the radius of a ball. Do you know �why?\tFirstly,\tbecause\tthe\tsize\tof\tan\tatom\t (~ 1.2 Å i.e., 1.2 × 10–10 m in radius) is very Unit 3.indd   859/9/2022   4:36:14 PM86small. Secondly, since the electron cloud surrounding the atom does not have a sharp \nboundary, the determination of the atomic \nsize cannot be precise. In other words, there is no practical way by which the size of an \nindividual atom can be measured. However, \nan estimate of the atomic size can be made by \nknowing the distance between the atoms in \nthe combined state. One practical approach to \nestimate the size of an atom of a non-metallic \nelement is to measure the distance between \ntwo atoms when they are bound together \nby a single bond in a covalent molecule and \nfrom this value, the “Covalent Radius” of the element\tcan\tbe\tcalculated.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tbond distance in the chlorine molecule (Cl2) is 198 pm and half this distance (99 pm), is �taken\tas\tthe\tatomic\tradius\tof\tchlorine.\tFor\tmetals,\twe\tdefine\tthe\tterm\t“Metallic Radius” which is taken as half the internuclear \ndistance separating the metal cores in the metallic\tcrystal.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tdistance\tbetween two adjacent copper atoms in solid \ncopper is 256 pm; hence the metallic radius �of\tcopper\tis\tassigned\ta\tvalue\tof\t128\tpm.\tFor\tsimplicity, in this book, we use the term Atomic Radius to refer to both covalent or metallic radius depending on whether the \nelement is a non-metal or a metal. Atomic \nradii can be measured by X-ray or other spectroscopic methods. The atomic radii of a few elements are listed in Table 3.6. Two trends are obvious. We can explain these trends in terms of nuclear charge \nand energy level. The atomic size generally \ndecreases across a period as illustrated in  Fig.\t3.4(a)\tfor\tthe\telements\tof\tthe\tsecond\tperiod. It is because within the period the \nouter electrons are in the same valence shell \nand the effective nuclear charge increases as the atomic number increases resulting in \nthe increased attraction of electrons to the \nnucleus. Within a family or vertical column \nof the periodic table, the atomic radius increases regularly with atomic number as �illustrated\tin\tFig.\t3.4(b).\tFor\talkali\tmetals\tand halogens, as we descend the groups, \nthe principal quantum number (n) increases and the valence electrons are farther from \nthe nucleus. This happens because the inner �energy\tlevels\tare\tfilled\twith\telectrons,\twhich\tserve to shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus. Consequently the size of �the\tatom\tincreases\tas\treflected\tin\tthe\tatomic\tradii.Note that the atomic radii of noble gases are not considered here. Being monoatomic, \ntheir (non-bonded radii) values are very \nlarge. In fact radii of noble gases should be \ncompared not with the covalent radii but with \nthe van der Waals radii of other elements.Table 3.6(a)  Atomic Radii/pm Across the PeriodsAtom (Period II)LiBeBCNOFAtomic radius1521118877746664Atom (Period III)NaMgAlSiPSClAtomic radius18616014311711010499 Table 3.6(b)  Atomic Radii/pm Down a FamilyAtom  (Group I)Atomic  RadiusAtom  (Group 17)Atomic  RadiusLi152F64Na186Cl99K231Br114Rb244I133Cs262At140Unit 3.indd   869/9/2022   4:36:14 PM87(b) Ionic RadiusThe removal of an electron from an atom results in the formation of a cation, whereas \ngain of an electron leads to an anion. The \nionic radii can be estimated by measuring \nthe distances between cations and anions \nin ionic crystals. In general, the ionic radii \nof elements exhibit the same trend as the \natomic radii. A cation is smaller than its \nparent atom because it has fewer electrons \nwhile its nuclear charge remains the same. \nThe size of an anion will be larger than that of \nthe parent atom because the addition of one \nor more electrons would result in increased \nrepulsion among the electrons and a decrease �in\teffective\tnuclear\tcharge.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tionic\tradius\tof\tfluoride\tion\t(F–) is 136 pm whereas\tthe\tatomic\tradius\tof\tfluorine\tis\tonly\t64 pm. On the other hand, the atomic radius \nof sodium is 186 pm compared to the ionic \nradius of 95 pm for Na+.When\twe\tfind\tsome\tatoms\tand\tions\twhich\tcontain the same number of electrons, we call \nthem isoelectronic species*.\tFor\texample,\t O2–,\tF–, Na+ and Mg2+ have the same number of electrons (10). Their radii would be different \nbecause of their different nuclear charges. The Fig. 3.4 (a)  Variation of atomic radius with atomic number across the second periodFig. 3.4 (b) Variation of atomic radius with \natomic number for alkali metals and \nhalogenscation with the greater positive charge will \nhave a smaller radius because of the greater attraction of the electrons to the nucleus. \nAnion with the greater negative charge will \nhave the larger radius. In this case, the net \nrepulsion of the electrons will outweigh the \nnuclear charge and the ion will expand in size.Problem 3.5Which of the following species will have the largest and the smallest size?\nMg, Mg2+, Al, Al3+.SolutionAtomic radii decrease across a period. \nCations are smaller than their parent atoms. Among isoelectronic species, \nthe one with the larger positive nuclear \ncharge will have a smaller radius.Hence the largest species is Mg; the smallest one is Al3+.(c) Ionization EnthalpyA quantitative measure of the tendency of an element to lose electron is given by its Ionization Enthalpy. It represents the energy required to remove an electron from an \nisolated gaseous atom (X) in its ground state. *  Two or more species with same number of atoms, same number of valence electrons and same structure, regardless of the nature of elements involved.Unit 3.indd   879/9/2022   4:36:14 PM88In\tother\twords,\tthe\tfirst\tionization enthalpy for an element X is the enthalpy change  (∆i H) for the reaction depicted in equation 3.1.X(g) → X+(g) + e–           (3.1)The ionization enthalpy is expressed in units of kJ mol–1.\tWe\tcan\tdefine\tthe\tsecond\tionization enthalpy as the energy required to remove the second most loosely bound electron; it is the energy required to carry out \nthe reaction shown in equation 3.2.\nX+(g) → X2+(g) + e–           (3.2)Energy is always required to remove electrons from an atom and hence ionization \nenthalpies are always positive. The second \nionization enthalpy will be higher than the �first\tionization\tenthalpy\tbecause\tit\tis\tmore\tdifficult\tto\tremove\tan\telectron\tfrom\ta\tpositively\tcharged ion than from a neutral atom. In the \nsame way the third ionization enthalpy will be \nhigher than the second and so on. The term �“ionization\tenthalpy”,\tif\tnot\tqualified,\tis\ttaken\tas\tthe\tfirst\tionization\tenthalpy.The\tfirst\tionization\tenthalpies\tof\telements\thaving atomic numbers up to 60 are plotted �in\tFig.\t3.5.\tThe\tperiodicity\tof\tthe\tgraph\tis\tquite\tstriking.\tYou\twill\tfind\tmaxima\tat\tthe\tnoble gases which have closed electron shells �and\tvery\tstable\telectron\tconfigurations.\tOn\tthe other hand, minima occur at the alkali \nmetals and their low ionization enthalpies Fig. 3.5  Variation of first ionization enthalpies \n(∆iH) with atomic number for elements with Z = 1 to 60can be correlated with their high reactivity. \nIn addition, you will notice two trends the �first\tionization\tenthalpy\tgenerally\tincreases\tas we go across a period and decreases \nas we descend in a group. These trends are\tillustrated\tin\tFigs.\t3.6(a)\tand\t3.6(b)\trespectively for the elements of the second �period\tand\tthe\tfirst\tgroup\tof\tthe\tperiodic\ttable. You will appreciate that the ionization \nenthalpy and atomic radius are closely related properties. To understand these trends, we �have\tto\tconsider\ttwo\tfactors\t:\t(i)\tthe\tattraction\tof electrons towards the nucleus, and (ii) the \nrepulsion of electrons from each other. The effective nuclear charge experienced by a Fig. 3.6(a) First ionization enthalpies (∆iH) of elements of the second period as a  function of atomic number (Z) and Fig. 3.6(b) ∆iH of alkali metals as a function of Z. 3.6 (a)3.6 (b)Unit 3.indd   889/9/2022   4:36:14 PM89valence electron in an atom will be less than the actual charge on the nucleus because of \n“shielding” or “screening” of the valence \nelectron from the nucleus by the intervening �core\telectrons.\tFor\texample,\tthe\t2s electron in lithium is shielded from the nucleus by \nthe inner core of 1s electrons. As a result, the valence electron experiences a net positive \ncharge which is  less than the actual charge \nof +3. In general, shielding is effective when \nthe orbitals in the inner shells are completely �filled.\tThis\tsituation\toccurs\tin\tthe\tcase\tof\talkali metals which have single outermost \nns-electron preceded by a noble gas electronic configuration.When\twe\tmove\tfrom\tlithium\tto\tfluorine\tacross the second period, successive electrons are added to orbitals in the same principal \nquantum level and the shielding of the nuclear charge by the inner core of electrons does \nnot increase very much to compensate for \nthe increased attraction of the electron to the \nnucleus. Thus, across a period, increasing \nnuclear charge outweighs the shielding. \nConsequently, the outermost electrons are \nheld more and more tightly and the ionization \nenthalpy increases across a period. As we go \ndown a group, the outermost electron being \nincreasingly farther from the nucleus, there is \nan increased shielding of the nuclear charge \nby the electrons in the inner levels. In this \ncase, increase in shielding outweighs the \nincreasing nuclear charge and the removal of \nthe outermost electron requires less energy \ndown a group.From\tFig.\t3.6(a),\tyou\twill\talso\tnotice\tthat\tthe\tfirst\tionization\tenthalpy\tof\tboron\t(Z = 5) is slightly less than that of beryllium (Z = 4) even though the former has a greater nuclear charge. When we consider the same principal \nquantum level, an s-electron is attracted to the nucleus more than a p-electron. In beryllium, the electron removed during the ionization is \nan s-electron whereas the electron removed during ionization of boron is a p-electron. The penetration of a 2s-electron to the nucleus is \nmore than that of a 2p-electron; hence the 2p \nelectron of boron is more shielded from the \nnucleus by the inner core of electrons than the 2s electrons of beryllium. Therefore, it is easier to remove the 2p-electron from boron \ncompared to the removal of a 2s- electron from beryllium.\tThus,\tboron\thas\ta\tsmaller\tfirst\tionization enthalpy than beryllium. Another \n“anomaly” is the smaller first ionization enthalpy of oxygen compared to nitrogen. This \narises because in the nitrogen atom, three \n2p-electrons reside in different atomic orbitals (Hund’s rule) whereas in the oxygen atom, \ntwo of the four 2p-electrons must occupy the \nsame 2p-orbital resulting in an increased \nelectron-electron repulsion. Consequently, \nit is easier to remove the fourth 2p-electron \nfrom oxygen than it is, to remove one of the \nthree 2p-electrons from nitrogen.Problem 3.6 The\tfirst\tionization\tenthalpy\t(∆i H ) values of the third period elements, Na, Mg and Si are respectively 496, 737 and 786 kJ  mol–1.\tPredict\twhether\tthe\tfirst\t∆i H value for Al will be more close to 575 or 760 kJ  mol–1 ? Justify your answer.Solution It will be more close to 575 kJ mol–1. The value for Al should be lower than \nthat of Mg because of effective shielding \nof 3p electrons from the nucleus by  3s-electrons.(d) Electron Gain Enthalpy When an electron is added to a neutral gaseous atom (X) to convert it into a negative \nion, the enthalpy change accompanying the \nprocess is defined as the Electron Gain \nEnthalpy (∆egH). Electron gain enthalpy provides a measure of the ease with which \nan atom adds an electron to form anion as \nrepresented by equation 3.3.X(g) + e–  →  X–(g)            (3.3)Depending on the element, the process of adding an electron to the atom can be either\tendothermic\tor\texothermic.\tFor\tmany\telements energy is released when an electron \nis added to the atom and the electron gain �enthalpy\tis\tnegative.\tFor\texample,\tgroup\t17 elements (the halogens) have very high Unit 3.indd   899/9/2022   4:36:15 PM90negative electron gain enthalpies because they can attain stable noble gas electronic �configurations\tby\tpicking\tup\tan\telectron.\tOn the other hand, noble gases have large positive electron gain enthalpies because the electron has to enter the next higher principal quantum level leading to a very unstable �electronic\tconfiguration.\tIt\tmay\tbe\tnoted\tthat\telectron gain enthalpies have large negative \nvalues toward the upper right of the periodic \ntable preceding the noble gases.The variation in electron gain enthalpies of elements is less systematic than for ionization \nenthalpies. As a general rule, electron gain \nenthalpy becomes more negative with increase in the atomic number across a period. The \neffective nuclear charge increases from left to \nright across a period and consequently it will \nbe easier to add an electron to a smaller atom \nsince the added electron on an average would \nbe closer to the positively charged nucleus. We \nshould also expect electron gain enthalpy to \nbecome less negative as we go down a group \nbecause the size of the atom increases and \nthe added electron would be farther from the \nnucleus. This is generally the case (Table \n3.7). However, electron gain enthalpy of O or �F\tis\tless\tnegative\tthan\tthat\tof\tthe\tsucceeding\telement. This is because when an electron is added\tto\tO\tor\tF,\tthe\tadded\telectron\tgoes\tto\tthe smaller n = 2 quantum level and suffers significant\trepulsion\tfrom\tthe\tother\telectrons\tpresent\tin\tthis\tlevel.\tFor\tthe\tn = 3 quantum level (S or Cl), the added electron occupies \na larger region of space and the electron-electron repulsion is much less.Problem 3.7Which of the following will have the most negative electron gain enthalpy and \nwhich the least negative?�P,\tS,\tCl,\tF.Explain your answer.SolutionElectron gain enthalpy generally \nbecomes more negative across a \nperiod as we move from left to right. Within a group, electron gain enthalpy \nbecomes less negative down a group. \nHowever, adding an electron to the \n2p-orbital leads to greater repulsion than adding an electron to the larger  3p-orbital. Hence the element with most negative electron gain enthalpy is \nchlorine; the one with the least negative \nelectron gain enthalpy is phosphorus.(e) ElectronegativityA qualitative measure of the ability of an atom in a chemical compound to attract shared \nelectrons to itself is called electronegativity. Unlike ionization enthalpy and electron gain \nenthalpy, it is not a measureable quantity. \nHowever, a number of numerical scales of \nelectronegativity of elements viz., Pauling \nscale, Mulliken-Jaffe scale, Allred-Rochow \nscale have been developed. The one which \nis the most widely used is the Pauling scale. \nLinus Pauling, an American scientist, in 1922 �assigned\tarbitrarily\ta\tvalue\tof\t4.0\tto\tfluorine,\tthe element considered to have the greatest * In many books, the negative of the enthalpy change for the process depicted in equation 3.3 is deﬁned as the ELECTRON AFFINITY (Ae ) of the atom under consideration. If energy is released when an electron is added to an atom, the electron afﬁnity is taken as positive, contrary to thermodynamic convention. If energy has to be supplied to add an electron to an \natom, then the electron afﬁnity of the atom is assigned a negative sign. However, electron afﬁnity is deﬁned as absolute \nzero and, therefore at any other temperature (T) heat capacities of the reactants and the products have to be taken into \naccount in ∆egH = Ae  5/2 RT.

Approximate values for the electronegativity of a few \nelements are given in Table 3.8(a)The electronegativity of any given element is not constant; it varies depending on the \nelement to which it is bound. Though it is \nnot a measurable quantity, it does provide a \nmeans of predicting the nature of force that \nholds a pair of atoms together – a relationship \nthat you will explore later.Electronegativity generally increases across a period from \nleft to right (say from lithium to �fluorine)\tand\tdecrease\tdown\ta\tgroup\t(say\tfrom\tfluorine\tto\tastatine)\tin the periodic table. How can \nthese trends be explained? \nCan the electronegativity be \nrelated to atomic radii, which tend to decrease across each \nperiod from left to right, but \nincrease down each group ? The \nattraction between the outer \n(or valence) electrons and the \nnucleus increases as the atomic \nradius decreases in a period. The \nelectronegativity also increases. On the same account electronegativity values \ndecrease with the increase in atomic radii \ndown a group. The trend is similar to that of \nionization enthalpy.Knowing the relationship between electronegativity and atomic radius, can \nyou now visualise the relationship between \nelectronegativity and non-metallic properties? \nNon-metallic  elements have strong tendency Fig. 3.7  The periodic trends of elements in the periodic tableTable 3.8(a)  Electronegativity Values (on Pauling scale) Across the PeriodsAtom (Period II)LiBeBCNOFElectronegativity1.01.52.02.53.03.54.0Atom (Period III)NaMgAlSiPSClElectronegativity0.91.21.51.82.12.53.0Table 3.8(b)  Electronegativity Values (on Pauling scale) Down a FamilyAtom  (Group I)Electronegativity ValueAtom  (Group 17)Electronegativity ValueLi1.0F4.0Na0.9Cl3.0K0.8Br2.8Rb0.8I2.5Cs0.7At2.2Unit 3.indd   919/9/2022   4:36:15 PM92to gain electrons. Therefore, electronegativity is directly related to that non-metallic properties \nof elements. It can be further extended to say \nthat the electronegativity is inversely related \nto the metallic properties of elements. Thus, \nthe increase in electronegativities across \na period is accompanied by an increase \nin non-metallic properties (or decrease in \nmetallic properties) of elements. Similarly, the \ndecrease in electronegativity down a group is \naccompanied by a decrease in non-metallic \nproperties (or increase in metallic properties) \nof elements.All these periodic trends are summarised in\tFigure\t3.7.3.7.2 Periodic Trends in Chemical    PropertiesMost of the trends in chemical properties of elements, such as diagonal relationships, inert \npair effect, effects of lanthanoid contraction \netc. will be dealt with along the discussion \nof each group in later units. In this section \nwe shall study the periodicity of the valence \nstate shown by elements and the anomalous \nproperties of the second period elements (from �lithium\tto\tfluorine).(a) Periodicity of Valence or Oxidation       StatesThe valence is the most characteristic property of the elements and can be understood in terms\tof\ttheir\telectronic\tconfigurations.\t\tThe\tvalence of representative elements is usually (though not necessarily) equal to the number \nof electrons in the outermost orbitals and/or \nequal to eight minus the number of outermost \nelectrons as shown below. Nowadays the term oxidation state is frequently used for valence. Consider the �two\toxygen\tcontaining\tcompounds:\tOF2 and Na2O. The order of electronegativity of the three elements involved in these compounds �is\tF\t\u003e\tO\t\u003e\tNa.\tEach\tof\tthe\tatoms\tof\tfluorine,\twith\touter\telectronic\tconfiguration\t2s22p5, shares\tone\telectron\twith\toxygen\tin\tthe\tOF2 molecule. Being highest electronegative \nelement, fluorine is given oxidation state �–1.\tSince\tthere\tare\ttwo\tfluorine\tatoms\tin\tthis molecule, oxygen with outer electronic �configuration\t2s22p4 shares two electrons with fluorine atoms and thereby exhibits \noxidation state +2. In Na2O, oxygen being more electronegative accepts two electrons, \none from each of the two sodium atoms and, \nthus, shows oxidation state –2. On the other �hand\tsodium\twith\telectronic\tconfiguration\t3s1 loses one electron to oxygen and is given oxidation state +1. Thus, the oxidation state \nof an element in a particular compound can �be\tdefined\tas\tthe\tcharge\tacquired\tby\tits\tatom\ton the basis of electronegative consideration from other atoms in the molecule.Problem 3.8Using the Periodic Table, predict the formulas of compounds which might \nbe formed by the following pairs of \nelements; (a) silicon and bromine  (b) aluminium and sulphur.Solution(a) Silicon is group 14 element with \na valence of 4; bromine belongs to \nthe halogen family with a valence of 1. Hence the formula of the \ncompound formed would be SiBr4.(b) Aluminium belongs to group \n13 with a valence of 3; sulphur belongs to group 16 elements with \na valence of 2. Hence, the formula \nof the compound formed would be Al2S3.Some periodic trends observed in the valence of elements (hydrides and oxides) are shown in Table 3.9. Other such periodic \ntrends which occur in the chemical behaviour \nof the elements are discussed elsewhere in Group12131415161718Number of valence electron12345678alence12343,52,61,70,8Unit 3.indd   929/9/2022   4:36:15 PM93this book. There are many elements which exhibit variable valence. This is particularly \ncharacteristic of transition elements and \nactinoids, which we shall study later.(b) Anomalous Properties of Second        Period ElementsThe\tfirst\telement\tof\teach\tof\tthe\tgroups\t1\t(lithium) and 2 (beryllium) and groups 13-17 (boron\tto\tfluorine)\tdiffers\tin\tmany\trespects\tfrom the other members of their respective group.\tFor\texample,\tlithium\tunlike\tother\talkali metals, and beryllium unlike other \nalkaline earth metals, form compounds with \npronounced covalent character; the other \nmembers of these groups predominantly form ionic compounds.

What are the reasons for the different chemical\tbehaviour\tof\tthe\tfirst\tmember\tof\ta group of elements in the s- and p-blocks compared to that of the subsequent members \nin the same group?

As a consequence of this, the maximum covalency of the first member of each group is 4 (e.g., boron can only form BF4\u001f\u001e\u001d, whereas the other members of the groups can expand their valence shell to accommodate more than \nfour pairs of electrons e.g., aluminium AlF63\u001f\u001e\u001d forms).\tFurthermore,\tthe\tfirst\tmember of p-block elements displays greater ability to form pπ – pπ  multiple bonds to itself (e.g., C = C, C ≡ C,   N = N, N ≡\tΝ) and to other second period elements (e.g., C = O, C = N, C ≡ N,  N = O) compared to subsequent members of the same group.Unit 3.indd   939/9/2022   4:36:15 PM94Problem 3.9Are the oxidation state and covalency of Al in [AlCl(H2O)5]2+ same ?SolutionNo. The oxidation state of Al is +3 and \nthe covalency is 6.3.7.3 Periodic Trends and Chemical   ReactivityWe have observed the periodic trends in certain fundamental properties such as atomic and ionic radii, ionization enthalpy, \nelectron gain enthalpy and valence. We \nknow by now that the periodicity is related to �electronic\tconfiguration.\tThat\tis,\tall\tchemical\tand physical properties are a manifestation of the\telectronic\tconfiguration\tof\telements.\tWe\tshall now try to explore relationships between \nthese fundamental properties of elements with \ntheir chemical reactivity.The atomic and ionic radii, as we know, generally decrease in a period from left to right. As a consequence, the ionization enthalpies \ngenerally increase (with some exceptions as \noutlined in section 3.7.1(a)) and electron gain \nenthalpies become more negative across a \nperiod. In other words, the ionization enthalpy \nof the extreme left element in a period is the \nleast and the electron gain enthalpy of the \nelement on the extreme right is the highest �negative\t(note\t:\tnoble\tgases\thaving\tcompletely\tfilled shells have rather positive electron \ngain enthalpy values). This results into high chemical reactivity at the two extremes and \nthe lowest in the centre. Thus, the maximum \nchemical reactivity at the extreme left (among \nalkali metals) is exhibited by the loss of an \nelectron leading to the formation of a cation \nand at the extreme right (among halogens) \nshown by the gain of an electron forming \nan anion. This property can be related with \nthe reducing and oxidizing behaviour of the \nelements which you will learn later. However, here it can be directly related to the metallic and non-metallic character of elements. Thus, \nthe metallic character of an element, which \nis highest at the extremely left decreases and \nthe non-metallic character increases while \nmoving from left to right across the period. \nThe chemical reactivity of an element can be \nbest shown by its reactions with oxygen and \nhalogens. Here, we shall consider the reaction \nof the elements with oxygen only. Elements \non two extremes of a period easily combine \nwith oxygen to form oxides. The normal oxide \nformed by the element on extreme left is the \nmost basic (e.g., Na2O), whereas that formed by the element on extreme right is the most \nacidic (e.g., Cl2O7). Oxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric (e.g., Al2O3, As2O3) or neutral (e.g., CO, NO, N2O). Amphoteric oxides behave as acidic with bases and as basic with \nacids, whereas neutral oxides have no acidic \nor basic properties.Problem 3.10Show by a chemical reaction with water that Na2O is a basic oxide and Cl2O7 is an acidic oxide.SolutionNa2O with water forms a strong base whereas Cl2O7 forms strong acid.Na2O + H2O → 2NaOHCl2O7 + H2O → 2HClO4Their basic or acidic nature can be qualitatively tested with litmus paper.Among transition metals (3d series), the change in atomic radii is much smaller as compared to those of representative elements \nacross the period. The change in atomic radii \nis still smaller among inner-transition metals  (4f series). The ionization enthalpies are intermediate between those of s- and p-blocks. \nAs a consequence, they are less electropositive \nthan group 1 and 2 metals.Unit 3.indd   949/9/2022   4:36:15 PM95In a group, the increase in atomic and ionic radii with increase in atomic number generally results in a gradual decrease in \nionization enthalpies and a regular decrease \n(with exception in some third period elements \nas shown in section 3.7.1(d)) in electron gain enthalpies in the case of main group elements. Thus, the metallic character increases down the group and non-metallic \ncharacter decreases. This trend can be related \nwith their reducing and oxidizing property \nwhich you will learn later. In the case of \ntransition elements, however, a reverse trend \nis observed. This can be explained in terms of \natomic size and ionization enthalpy.SUMMARYIn this Unit, you have studied the development of the Periodic Law and the Periodic Table. Mendeleev’s Periodic Table was based on atomic masses. Modern Periodic Table arranges the elements in the order of their atomic numbers in seven horizontal rows (periods) and eighteen vertical columns (groups or families). Atomic numbers in a period are consecutive, whereas in a group they increase in a pattern. Elements of the same group have similar \nvalence shell\telectronic\tconfiguration\tand,\ttherefore,\texhibit\tsimilar\tchemical\tproperties.\tHowever, the elements of the same period have incrementally increasing number of electrons �from\tleft\tto\tright,\tand,\ttherefore,\thave\tdifferent\tvalencies.\tFour\ttypes\tof\telements\tcan\tbe\trecognized\tin\tthe\tperiodic\ttable\ton\tthe\tbasis\tof\ttheir\telectronic\tconfigurations.\tThese\tare\ts-block, p-block, d-block and f-block elements. Hydrogen with one electron in the 1s orbital occupies a unique position in the periodic table. Metals comprise more than seventy eight per cent of the known elements. Non-metals, which are located at the top of the periodic table, are less than twenty in number. Elements which lie at the border line between metals and non-metals (e.g., Si, Ge, As) are called metalloids or semi-metals. Metallic character \nincreases with increasing atomic number in a group whereas decreases from left to right \nin a period. The physical and chemical properties of elements vary periodically with their \natomic numbers. Periodic trends are observed in atomic sizes, ionization enthalpies, electron gain enthalpies, electronegativity and valence. The atomic radii decrease while going from left to right in a period and increase with atomic number in a group. Ionization enthalpies generally increase across a period and decrease down a group. Electronegativity also shows \na similar trend. Electron gain enthalpies, in general, become more negative across a period \nand less negative down a group. There is some periodicity in valence, for example, among \nrepresentative elements, the valence is either equal to the number of electrons in the \noutermost orbitals or eight minus this number. Chemical reactivity is highest at the two \nextremes of a period and is lowest in the centre. The reactivity on the left extreme of a period \nis because of the ease of electron loss (or low ionization enthalpy). Highly reactive elements \ndo not occur in nature in free state; they usually occur in the combined form. Oxides formed \nof the elements on the left are basic and of the elements on the right are acidic in nature. \nOxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric or neutral.Unit 3.indd   959/9/2022   4:36:15 PM96EXERCISES3.1 What is the basic theme of organisation in the periodic table?3.2 Which important property did Mendeleev use to classify the elements in his periodic table and did he stick to that?3.3 What is the basic difference in approach between the Mendeleev’s Periodic Law and \nthe Modern Periodic Law?3.4 On the basis of quantum numbers, justify that the sixth period of the periodic table \nshould have 32 elements.3.5 In terms of period and group where would you locate the element with Z =114?3.6 Write the atomic number of the element present in the third period and seventeenth group of the periodic table.3.7 Which element do you think would have been named by (i) Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (ii) Seaborg’s group?3.8 Why do elements in the same group have similar physical and chemical properties?3.9 What does atomic radius and ionic radius really mean to you?3.10 How do atomic radius vary in a period and in a group?

In the case of sodium and \nchlorine, this can happen by the transfer of \nan electron from sodium to chlorine thereby �giving\tthe\tNa+ and Cl– ions. In the case of other molecules like Cl2,\tH2, F2, etc., the bond is formed by the sharing of a pair of electrons \nbetween the atoms. In the process each atom \nattains a stable outer octet of electrons.Lewis Symbols: In the formation of a molecule, only the outer shell electrons take \npart in chemical combination and they are \nknown as valence electrons.\tThe\tinner\tshell\telectrons are well protected and are generally �not\tinvolved\tin\tthe\tcombination\tprocess.

In the process both chlorine atoms attain the outer shell octet of �the\tnearest\tnoble\tgas\t(i.e.,\targon).\tThe dots represent electrons.

Isoelectronic molecules and ions have identical bond orders; for example, F2 and O2 2– have bond order 1. N2, CO and NO+ have bond order 3.A general correlation useful for understanding the stablities of molecules  is that: with increase in bond order, \nbond enthalpy increases and bond length \ndecreases. 4.3.5 Resonance StructuresIt\tis\toften\tobserved\tthat\ta\tsingle\tLewis\tstructure\tis inadequate for the representation of a molecule\tin\tconformity\twith\tits\texperimentally\tdetermined\tparameters.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tozone, O3 molecule can be equally represented by the structures I and II shown below:In\tboth\tstructures\twe\thave\ta\tO–O\tsingle\tbond\tand\ta\tO=O\tdouble\tbond.\tThe\tnormal\t O–O\tand\tO=O\tbond\tlengths\tare\t148\tpm\tand\t121\tpm\trespectively.\tExperimentally\tdetermined\toxygen-oxygen\tbond\tlengths\tin\tthe O3\tmolecule\tare\tsame\t(128\tpm).\tThus\tthe\toxygen-oxygen\tbonds\tin\tthe\tO3 molecule are intermediate between a double and a single bond.\tObviously,\tthis\tcannot\tbe\trepresented\tby\teither\tof\tthe\ttwo\tLewis\tstructures\tshown\tabove.\tThe\tconcept\tof\tresonance\twas\tintroduced\tto\tdeal\twith\tthe\ttype\tof\tdifficulty\texperienced\tin the depiction of accurate structures of molecules like O3. According to the concept of resonance, whenever a single Lewis \nstructure cannot describe a molecule \naccurately, a number of structures with \nsimilar energy, positions of nuclei, bonding \nand non-bonding pairs of electrons are \ntaken as the canonical structures of the \nhybrid which describes the molecule \naccurately.\tThus\tfor\tO3, the two structures shown\tabove\tconstitute\tthe\tcanonical\tstructures or resonance structures and \ntheir hybrid i.e., the III structure represents \nthe structure of O3\tmore\taccurately.\tThis\tis\talso called resonance hybrid.\tResonance\tis\trepresented by a double headed arrow.Fig. 4.3 Resonance in the O3 molecule(structures I and II represent the two canonical forms while the structure III is the resonance hybrid)Unit 4.indd   1099/12/2022   9:36:11 AM110Some\tof\tthe\tother\texamples\tof\tresonance\tstructures\tare\tprovided\tby\tthe\tcarbonate ion and the carbon dioxide molecule.Problem 4.3 Explain\tthe\tstructure\tof\tCO32– ion in terms of resonance.SolutionThe\tsingle\tLewis\tstructure\tbased\ton\tthe presence of two single bonds and one double bond between carbon and\toxygen\tatoms\tis\tinadequate\tto\trepresent the molecule accurately as it \nrepresents unequal bonds.

Consider the hydrogen molecule consisting �of\ttwo\tatoms\tA\tand\tB.\tEach\thydrogen\tatom\tin the ground state has one electron in 1s �orbital.\tThe\tatomic\torbitals\tof\tthese\tatoms\tmay\tbe\trepresented\tby\tthe\twave\tfunctions\tψA and ψB. Mathematically, the formation of molecular orbitals may be described by the \nlinear combination of atomic orbitals that can \ntake place by addition and by subtraction of �wave\tfunctions\tof\tindividual\tatomic\torbitals\tas shown below :ψMO\t=\tψA + ψBTherefore,\tthe\ttwo\tmolecular\torbitals\t σ and σ* are formed as : σ   =  ψA + ψB σ*\t=\t ψA – ψBThe\tmolecular\torbital\tσ formed by the addition of atomic orbitals is called the bonding molecular orbital while the molecular orbital σ* formed by the subtraction of atomic orbital is called antibonding molecular orbital as depicted\tin\tFig.\t4.19.Fig.4.19 Formation of bonding (σ) and antibonding (σ*) molecular orbitals by the linear  combination of atomic orbitals ψA and ψB centered on two atoms A and B respectively.Qualitatively,\tthe\tformation\tof\tmolecular\torbitals can be understood in terms of the �constructive\tor\tdestructive\tinterference\tof\tthe\telectron\twaves\tof\tthe\tcombining\tatoms.\tIn\tthe\tformation of bonding molecular orbital, the �two\telectron\twaves\tof\tthe\tbonding\tatoms\treinforce\teach\tother\tdue\tto\tconstructive\tinterference while in the formation of σ*\t=\tψA – ψBψAψBσ  = ψA + ψBUnit 4.indd   1269/12/2022   9:36:17 AM127antibonding molecular orbital, the electron waves\tcancel\teach\tother\tdue\tto\tdestructive\tinterference. As a result, the electron density in \na bonding molecular orbital is located between \nthe nuclei of the bonded atoms because of �which\tthe\trepulsion\tbetween\tthe\tnuclei\tis\tvery\tless while in case of an antibonding molecular orbital, most of the electron density is located \naway from the space between the nuclei. �Infact,\tthere\tis\ta\tnodal\tplane\t(on\twhich\tthe\telectron\tdensity\tis\tzero)\tbetween\tthe\tnuclei\tand hence the repulsion between the nuclei is �high.\tElectrons\tplaced\tin\ta\tbonding\tmolecular\torbital tend to hold the nuclei together and �stabilise\ta\tmolecule.\tTherefore,\ta\tbonding\tmolecular orbital always possesses lower \nenergy than either of the atomic orbitals that �have\tcombined\tto\tform\tit.\tIn\tcontrast,\tthe\telectrons placed in the antibonding molecular �orbital\tdestabilise\tthe\tmolecule.\tThis\tis\tbecause the mutual repulsion of the electrons \nin this orbital is more than the attraction between the electrons and the nuclei, which \ncauses a net increase in energy.It may be noted that the energy of the antibonding\torbital\tis\traised\tabove\tthe\tenergy of the parent atomic orbitals that have\tcombined\tand\tthe\tenergy\tof\tthe\tbonding\torbital has been lowered than the parent orbitals.\tThe\ttotal\tenergy\tof\ttwo\tmolecular\torbitals,\thowever,\tremains\tthe\tsame\tas\tthat\tof two original atomic orbitals. 4.7.2 Conditions for the Combination of Atomic OrbitalsThe\tlinear\tcombination\tof\tatomic\torbitals\tto\tform molecular orbitals takes place only if the following\tconditions\tare\tsatisfied:1. The combining atomic orbitals must have the same or nearly the same energy. �This\tmeans\tthat\t1s orbital can combine with another 1s orbital but not with 2s orbital because the energy of 2s orbital is appreciably higher than that of 1s\torbital.\tThis\tis\tnot\ttrue\tif\tthe\tatoms\tare\tvery\tdifferent.2. The combining atomic orbitals must have the same symmetry about the molecular axis.\tBy\tconvention\tz-axis\tis\ttaken\tas\tthe\tmolecular\taxis.\tIt\tis\timportant\tto\tnote\tthat\tatomic\torbitals\thaving\tsame\tor\tnearly\tthe same energy will not combine if they do not\thave\tthe\tsame\tsymmetry.\tFor\texample,\t2pz orbital of one atom can combine with 2pz orbital of the other atom but not with the \n2px or 2py orbitals because of their different symmetries. 3. The combining atomic orbitals  must overlap to the maximum extent. Greater the\textent\tof\toverlap,\tthe\tgreater\twill\tbe\tthe\telectron-density\tbetween\tthe\tnuclei\tof\ta\tmolecular orbital.4.7.3 Types of Molecular OrbitalsMolecular orbitals of diatomic molecules are designated as σ\t(sigma),\tπ\t(pi),\tδ (delta),\tetc.In this nomenclature, the sigma () molecular orbitals are symmetrical around the bond-axis while pi () molecular orbitals are not symmetrical.\tFor\texample,\tthe\tlinear\tcombination of 1s orbitals centered on two nuclei produces two molecular orbitals which �are\tsymmetrical\taround\tthe\tbond-axis.\tSuch\tmolecular orbitals are of the σ type and are designated as σ1s and σ*1s\t[Fig.\t4.20(a),\tpage\t124].\tIf internuclear axis is taken to be in the z-direction, it can be seen that a linear \ncombination of 2pz- orbitals of two atoms also produces two sigma molecular orbitals \ndesignated as 2pz and *2pz. [Fig.\t4.20(b)]Molecular orbitals obtained from 2px and 2py orbitals are not symmetrical around the bond\taxis\tbecause\tof\tthe\tpresence\tof\tpositive\tlobes\tabove\tand\tnegative\tlobes\tbelow\tthe\tmolecular\tplane.\tSuch\tmolecular\torbitals,\tare labelled as π and\t=π*\t[Fig.\t4.20(c)].\tA\tπ bonding MO has larger electron density above\tand\tbelow\tthe\tinter-nuclear\taxis.\tThe\tπ* antibonding MO has a node between the nuclei.4.7.4 Energy Level Diagram for Molecular OrbitalsWe\thave\tseen\tthat\t1s atomic orbitals on two atoms form two molecular orbitals designated as σ1s and σ*1s.

    "input": "THERMODYNAMICSIt is the only physical theory of universal content concerning which I am convinced that, within the framework of the \napplicability of its basic concepts, it will never be overthrown.Albert EinsteinChemical energy stored by molecules can be released as heat during chemical reactions when a fuel like methane, \ncooking gas or coal burns in air. The chemical energy may \nalso be used to do mechanical work when a fuel burns \nin an engine or to provide electrical energy through a \ngalvanic cell like dry cell. Thus, various forms of energy \nare interrelated and under certain conditions, these may \nbe transformed from one form into  another. The study \nof these energy transformations forms the subject matter \nof thermodynamics. The laws of thermodynamics deal \nwith energy changes of macroscopic systems involving \na large number of molecules rather than microscopic \nsystems containing a few molecules. Thermodynamics is \nnot concerned about how and at what rate these energy \ntransformations are carried out, but is based on initial and �final states of a system undergoing the change. Laws of \nthermodynamics apply only when a system is in equilibrium \nor moves from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium \nstate. Macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature \ndo not change with time for a system in equilibrium state. \nIn this unit, we would like to answer some of the important \nquestions through thermodynamics, like:How do we determine the energy changes involved in a chemical reaction/process? Will it occur or not?What drives a chemical reaction/process?\nTo what extent do the chemical reactions proceed? UNIT 5After studying this Unit, you will be able to• explain the terms : system and surroundings;• discriminate between close, open \nand isolated systems;• explain internal energy, work and \nheat;• state first law of thermodynamics \nand express it mathematically;• calculate energy changes as \nwork and heat contributions in chemical systems;• explain state functions: U, H. • correlate  ∆U and ∆H;• measure experimentally ∆U and ∆H;• define standard states for ∆H;• calculate enthalpy changes for \nvarious types of reactions; • state and apply Hess’s law of constant heat summation;• differentiate between extensive \nand intensive properties;• define spontaneous and non-\nspontaneous processes;• explain entropy as a thermodynamic state function \nand apply it for spontaneity;• explain Gibbs energy change (∆G); and• establish relationship between �∆G and spontaneity, ∆G and equilibrium constant.Unit 5.indd   1369/12/2022   11:53:33 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         1375.1  THERMODYNAMIC TERMSWe are interested in chemical reactions and the energy changes accompanying them. For \nthis we need to know certain thermodynamic \nterms. These are discussed below. 5.1.1 The System and the SurroundingsA system in thermodynamics refers to that part of universe in which observations are made and remaining universe constitutes the surroundings. The surroundings include everything other than the system. System \nand the surroundings together constitute the \nuniverse. The universe = The system + The surroundingsHowever, the entire universe other than the system is not affected by the changes taking place in the system. Therefore, for all \npractical purposes, the surroundings are that \nportion of the remaining universe which can \ninteract with the system. Usually, the region \nof space in the neighbourhood of the system \nconstitutes its surroundings.For example, if we are studying the reaction between two substances A and B \nkept in a beaker, the beaker containing the \nreaction mixture is the system and the room \nwhere the beaker is kept is the surroundings \n(Fig. 5.1). Fig. 5.1 System and the surroundingsthe system from the surroundings is called \nboundary. This is designed to allow us to \ncontrol and keep track of all movements of \nmatter and energy in or out of the system.  5.1.2 Types of the SystemWe, further classify the systems according to the movements of matter and energy in or out of the system.1. Open SystemIn an open system, there is exchange of energy and matter between system and surroundings \n[Fig. 5.2 (a)]. The presence of reactants in an open beaker is an example of an open system*. Here the boundary is an imaginary surface \nenclosing the beaker and reactants.2. Closed SystemIn a closed system, there is no exchange of matter, but exchange of energy is possible between system and the surroundings  [Fig. 5.2 (b)]. The presence of reactants in a \nclosed vessel made of conducting material \ne.g., copper or steel is an example of a closed \nsystem.Fig. 5.2  Open, closed and isolated systems.Note that the system may be defined by physical boundaries, like beaker or test �tube, or the system may simply be defined \nby a set of Cartesian coordinates specifying \na particular volume in space. It is necessary \nto think of the system as separated from the \nsurroundings by some sort of wall which may \nbe real or imaginary. The wall that separates *  We could have chosen only the reactants as system then walls of the beakers will act as boundary.Unit 5.indd   1379/12/2022   11:53:34 AM1383. Isolated SystemIn an isolated system, there is no exchange of energy or matter between the system and \nthe surroundings [Fig. 5.2 (c)]. The presence �of reactants in a thermos flask or any other closed insulated vessel is an example of an \nisolated system. 5.1.3 The State of the SystemThe system must be described in order to make any useful calculations by specifying \nquantitatively each of the properties such as \nits pressure (p), volume (V), and temperature (T ) as well as the composition of the system. We need to describe the system by specifying \nit before and after the change. You would \nrecall from your Physics course that the \nstate of a system in mechanics is completely �specified at a given instant of time, by the \nposition and velocity of each mass point of \nthe system. In thermodynamics, a different \nand much simpler concept of the state of a \nsystem is introduced. It does not need detailed \nknowledge of motion of each particle  because, \nwe deal with average measurable properties of \nthe system. We specify the state of the system \nby state functions or state variables.The state of a thermodynamic system is described by its measurable or macroscopic  \n(bulk) properties. We can describe the state \nof a gas by quoting its pressure (p), volume \n(V), temperature (T ), amount (n) etc. Variables like p, V, T are called state variables or state functions because their values depend only \non the state of the system and not on how it �is reached. In order to completely define the �state of a system it is not necessary to define \nall the properties of the system; as only a \ncertain number of properties can be varied \nindependently. This number depends on the \nnature of the system. Once these minimum �number of macroscopic properties are fixed, �others automatically have definite values.The state of the surroundings can never be completely specified; fortunately it is not necessary to do so.5.1.4 The Internal Energy as a State FunctionWhen we talk about our chemical system losing or gaining energy, we need to introduce a quantity which represents the total energy of the system. It may be chemical, electrical, \nmechanical or any other type of energy you \nmay think of, the sum of all these is the energy \nof the system. In thermodynamics, we call it  \nthe internal energy, U of the system, which \nmay change, when•\theat passes into or out of the system,•\twork is done on or by the system,•\tmatter enters or leaves the system. These systems are classified accordingly as you have already studied in section 5.1.2.(a) Work Let us first examine a change in internal energy by doing work. We take a system containing some quantity of water in a thermos flask \nor in an insulated beaker. This would not \nallow exchange of heat between the system \nand surroundings through its boundary and \nwe call this type of system as adiabatic. The manner in which the state of such a system \nmay be changed will be called adiabatic \nprocess. Adiabatic process is a process in \nwhich there is no transfer of heat between \nthe system and surroundings. Here, the wall \nseparating the system and the surroundings is called the adiabatic wall (Fig. 5.3). Fig. 5.3 An adiabatic system which does not \npermit the transfer of heat through its \nboundary.Let us bring the change in the internal energy of the system by doing some work on it. Let us call the  initial state of the system \nas state A and its temperature as  TA. Let the internal energy of the system in state A \nbe called UA. We can change the state of the system in two different ways.Unit 5.indd   1389/12/2022   11:53:36 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         139One way: We do some mechanical work, say 1 kJ, by rotating a set of small paddles and �thereby churning water. Let the new state \nbe called B state and its temperature, as \nTB. It is found that TB \u003e TA and the change in temperature, ∆T = TB–TA. Let the internal energy of the system in state B be UB and the change in internal energy, ∆U =UB– UA.Second way: We now do an equal amount (i.e., 1kJ) electrical work with the help of an \nimmersion rod  and note down the temperature �change. We find that the change in temperature \nis same as in the earlier case, say, TB – TA.In fact, the experiments in the above manner were done by J. P. Joule between \n1840–50 and he was able to show that a \ngiven amount of work done on the system, \nno matter how it was done (irrespective of \npath) produced the same change of state, as \nmeasured by the change in the temperature \nof the system. So, it seems appropriate to define a quantity, the internal energy U, whose value \nis characteristic of the state of a system, \nwhereby the adiabatic work, wad required to bring about a change of state is equal to the \ndifference between the value of U in one state and that in another state, ∆U i.e.,∆U =U2 –U1= wadTherefore, internal energy, U, of the system is a state function. By conventions of IUPAC in chemical thermodynamics. The positive sign expresses that wad  is positive when work is done on the system and the internal energy of system \nincreases. Similarly, if the work is done by the system, wad will be negative because internal energy of the system decreases.Can you name some other familiar state functions? Some of other familiar state \nfunctions are V, p, and  T. For example, if we bring a change in temperature of the system \nfrom 25°C to 35°C, the change in temperature \nis 35°C–25°C = +10°C, whether we go straight \nup to 35°C or we cool the system for a few �degrees, then take the system to the final \ntemperature. Thus, T is a state function and \nthe change in temperature is independent of the route taken. Volume of water in a pond, for \nexample, is a state function, because change \nin volume of its water is independent of the �route by which water is filled in the pond, either by rain or by tubewell or by both. (b) HeatWe can also change the internal energy of a system by transfer of heat from the surroundings to the system or vice-versa \nwithout expenditure of work. This exchange \nof energy, which is a result of temperature \ndifference is called heat, q. Let us consider \nbringing about the same change in temperature �(the same initial and final states as before \nin section 5.1.4 (a) by transfer of heat \nthrough thermally conducting walls instead \nof adiabatic walls (Fig. 5.4). We take water at temperature, TA in a container having thermally conducting walls, say made up of copper and enclose it in a \nhuge heat reservoir at temperature, TB. The heat absorbed by the system (water), q can be measured in terms of temperature difference, \nTB – TA. In this case change in internal energy, ∆U = q, when no work is done at constant volume.By conventions of IUPAC in chemical thermodynamics. The  q is positive, when heat \nis transferred from the surroundings to the \nsystem and the internal energy of the system \nincreases and q is negative when heat is \ntransferred from system to the surroundings \nresulting in decrease of the internal energy of the system. * Earlier negative sign was assigned when the work is done on the system and positive sign when the work is done by the system. This is still followed in physics books, although IUPAC has recommended the use of new sign convention.Fig. 5.4 A system which allows heat transfer \nthrough its boundary.Unit 5.indd   1399/12/2022   11:53:37 AM140(c) The general caseLet us consider the general case in which a change of state is brought about both by  doing work and by transfer of heat. We write \nchange in internal energy for this case as:      ∆U = q  + w           (5.1)For a given change in state, q and w can vary depending on how the change is carried out. However, q +w = ∆U will depend only on initial and final state. It will be independent \nof the way the change is carried out. If there \nis no transfer of energy as heat or as work \n(isolated system) i.e., if w = 0 and q = 0, then  ∆ U = 0. \nThe equation 5.1 i.e., ∆U = q + w is mathematical statement of the first law of \nthermodynamics, which states that The energy of an isolated system is \nconstant. It is commonly stated as the law of conservation \nof energy i.e., energy can neither be created \nnor be destroyed.Note: There is considerable difference between the character of the thermodynamic property energy and that of a mechanical property such \nas volume. We can specify an unambiguous \n(absolute) value for volume of a system in a \nparticular state, but not the absolute value of \nthe internal energy. However, we can measure \nonly the changes in the internal energy, ∆U \nof the system. Problem 5.1Express the change in internal energy of a system when(i) No heat is absorbed by the system \nfrom the surroundings, but work \n(w) is done on the system. What \ntype of wall does the system have ?(ii) No work is done on the system, but q  amount of heat is taken out from the system and given to the \nsurroundings. What type of wall \ndoes the system have?(iii) w amount of work is done by the \nsystem and q amount of heat is supplied to the system. What type \nof system would it be?Solution (i)  ∆ U = w ad, wall is adiabatic(ii) ∆ U = – q, thermally conducting walls (iii) ∆ U = q – w, closed system.5.2 APPLICATIONSMany chemical reactions involve the generation of gases capable of doing mechanical work or \nthe generation of heat. It is important for us \nto quantify these changes and relate them to the changes in the internal energy. Let us \nsee how!5.2.1 WorkFirst of all, let us concentrate on the nature of work a system can do. We will consider only mechanical work i.e., pressure-volume work.For understanding pressure-volume work, let us consider a cylinder which contains one mole of an ideal gas fitted with a frictionless piston. Total volume of the gas \nis Vi and pressure of the gas inside is p. If external pressure is pex which is greater  than p, piston is moved inward till the pressure Fig. 5.5 (a) Work done on an ideal gas in a \ncylinder when it is compressed by a constant external pressure, pex (in single step) is equal to the shaded \narea.Unit 5.indd   1409/12/2022   11:53:37 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         141inside becomes equal to pex. Let this change be achieved in a single step and the final volume be Vf . During this compression, suppose piston moves a distance, l and is cross-sectional area of the piston is A  [Fig. 5.5(a)].\nthen, volume change = l × A = ∆V = (Vf  – Vi )We also know, pressure = Therefore, force on the piston = pex . AIf  w is the work done on the system by \nmovement of the piston thenw = force × distance = pex . A .l    = pex . (–∆V) = – pex ∆V = – pex (Vf – Vi )       (5.2)The negative sign of this expression is required to obtain conventional sign for w, which will be positive. It indicates that in case \nof compression work is done on the system. \nHere (Vf – Vi ) will be negative and negative multiplied by negative will be positive. Hence \nthe sign obtained for the work will be positive.If the pressure is not constant at every stage of compression, but changes in number �of finite steps, work done on the gas will be \nsummed over all the steps and will be equal �to – Σ р ∆V [Fig. 5.5 (b)] If the pressure is not constant but changes during the process such that it is always infinitesimally greater than the \npressure of the gas, then, at each stage of \ncompression, the volume decreases by an �infinitesimal amount, dV. In such a case we can calculate the work done on the gas by the  relation w\u001f\u001e\u001dpdVexVVif                                 (5.3)Here, pex at each stage is equal to (pin + dp) in case of compression [Fig. 5.5(c)]. In an expansion process under similar conditions, \nthe external pressure is always less than the \npressure of the system i.e., pex = (pin– dp). In general case we can write, pex = (pin +  dp). Such processes are called reversible processes.A process or change is said to be reversible, if a change is brought out in such a way that the process could, at any moment, �be reversed by an infinitesimal change. �A reversible process proceeds infinitely �slowly by a series of equilibrium states \nsuch that system and the surroundings are �always in near equilibrium with each other. Fig. 5.5 (c) pV-plot when pressure is not constant and changes in infinite steps (reversible conditions) during compression from initial volume, Vi to final volume, Vf . Work done on the gas is represented \nby the shaded area. Fig. 5.5 (b) pV-plot when pressure is not constant \nand changes in finite steps during compression from initial volume, Vi to final volume, Vf . Work done on the gas is represented by the shaded area. Unit 5.indd   1419/12/2022   11:53:37 AM142Processes other than reversible processes are known as irreversible processes.In chemistry, we face problems that can be solved if we relate the work term to the \ninternal pressure of the system. We can \nrelate work to internal pressure of the system \nunder reversible conditions by writing equation 5.3 as follows:wrevexVVVVpdVpdpdVifi\nf\u001f\u001e\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001c()inSince dp × dV is very small we can writewrevVVdi\nf\u001f\u001e\u001dpVin                                (5.4)Now, the pressure of the gas (pin which we can write as p now) can be expressed in terms of its volume through gas equation. For n mol of an ideal gas i.e., pV =nRT\u001f\u001epTVnRTherefore, at constant temperature (isothermal process),  wrev\u001f\u001e\u001f\u001e\u001dnnRRTdVVTVVfiVVifln= – 2.303 nRT log VVfi         (5.5)Free expansion: Expansion of a gas in vacuum (pex = 0) is called free expansion. No work is done during free expansion of an \nideal gas whether the process is reversible or \nirreversible (equation 5.2 and 5.3).Now, we  can write equation 5.1 in number of ways depending on the type of processes.Let us substitute w = – pex∆V (eq. 5.2) in equation 5.1, and we get   \u001f\u001fUqpVex\u001e\u001dIf a process is carried out at constant volume \n(∆V = 0), then ∆U = qVthe subscript V in qV denotes that heat is supplied at constant volume.Isothermal and free expansion of an \nideal gasFor isothermal (T = constant) expansion of an ideal gas into vacuum; w = 0 since pex = 0. Also, Joule determined experimentally that  q = 0; therefore, ∆U = 0Equation 5.1, can be expressed for isothermal irreversible and reversible changes as follows: \n1. For isothermal irreversible change q = – w = pex (Vf – Vi ) 2. For isothermal reversible change  q = – w = nRT ln       =  2.303 nRT log VVfi For adiabatic change, q = 0,  ∆U = wadProblem 5.2Two litres of an ideal gas at a pressure of 10 atm expands isothermally at 25 °C into a \nvacuum until its total volume is 10 litres. \nHow much heat is absorbed and how \nmuch work is done in the expansion ?SolutionWe have  q = – w =  pex (10 – 2) = 0(8) = 0No work is done; no heat is absorbed.Problem 5.3Consider the same expansion, but this time against a constant external \npressure of 1 atm.SolutionWe have  q = – w =  pex (8) = 8 litre-atmProblem 5.4Consider the expansion given in problem 5.2, for 1 mol of an ideal gas conducted \nreversibly.SolutionWe have q = – w =  2.303 nRT logVVfs   = 2.303 × 1 × 0.8206 × 298 × log 102  Unit 5.indd   1429/12/2022   11:53:38 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         143Remember ∆H = qp, heat absorbed by the  system at constant pressure. ∆H is negative for exothermic reactions which evolve heat during the reaction and ∆H is positive for endothermic reactions �which absorb heat from the surroundings. At constant volume (∆V = 0), ∆U = qV, therefore equation 5.8 becomes ∆H = ∆U = qVThe difference between  ∆H and ∆U is not usually significant for systems consisting \nof only solids and / or liquids. Solids and �liquids do not suffer any significant volume \nchanges upon heating. The difference, �however, becomes significant when gases are �involved. Let us consider a reaction involving \ngases. If VA is the total volume of the gaseous reactants, VB is the total volume of the gaseous products, nA is the number of moles of gaseous reactants and nB is the number of moles of gaseous products, all at constant pressure \nand temperature, then using the ideal gas law, we write,  pVA = nARTand  pVB = nBRTThus,  pVB – pVA = nBRT – nART = (nB–nA)RT or p (VB – VA) = (nB – nA) RTor       p ∆V = ∆ngRT (5.9)Here, ∆ng refers to the number of moles of gaseous products minus the number of moles of gaseous reactants.Substituting the value of p∆V from equation 5.9 in equation 5.8, we get ∆H = ∆U + ∆ngRT (5.10)The equation 5.10 is useful for calculating ∆H from ∆U and vice versa. Problem 5.5If water vapour is assumed to be a perfect gas, molar enthalpy change for \nvapourisation of 1 mol of water at 1bar \nand 100°C is 41kJ mol–1. Calculate the internal energy change, when= 2.303 x 0.8206 x 298 x log 5= 2.303 x 0.8206 x 298 x 0.6990�= 393.66 L atm5.2.2 Enthalpy, H(a) A Useful New State FunctionWe know that the heat absorbed at constant volume is equal to change in the internal energy i.e., ∆U = qV. But most of chemical reactions are carried out not at constant �volume, but in flasks or test tubes under \nconstant atmospheric pressure. We need to �define another state function which may be \nsuitable under these conditions. We may write equation (5.1) as ∆U = qp – p∆V at constant pressure, where qp  is heat absorbed by the system and –p∆V represent expansion work done by the system.Let us represent the initial state by  subscript 1 and final state by 2We can rewrite the above equation as U2–U1 = qp – p (V2 – V1)On rearranging, we get\nqp = (U2 + pV2) – (U1 + pV1) (5.6)Now we can define another thermodynamic function, the enthalpy H [Greek word enthalpien, to warm or heat content] as :H = U + pV    (5.7)  so, equation (5.6) becomesqp= H2 – H1 = ∆HAlthough q is a path dependent function, H is a state function because it depends on U, p and V, all of which are state functions. Therefore, ∆H is independent of path. Hence, qp is also independent of path.For finite changes at constant pressure, we can write equation 5.7 as∆H = ∆U + ∆pVSince p is constant, we can write �∆H = ∆U + p∆V (5.8)It is important to note that when heat is absorbed by the system at constant pressure, we are actually measuring changes in the enthalpy.Unit 5.indd   1439/12/2022   11:53:38 AM1441 mol of water is vapourised at 1 bar pressure and 100°C.Solution(i)  The change H2O (l) → H2O (g)∆H = ∆U + ∆ngRTor ∆U = ∆H – ∆ngRT, substituting the values, we get∆U = 41.00 kJ mol–1 – 1   × 8.3 J mol–1 K–1 × 373 K= 41.00 kJ mol-1 – 3.096 kJ mol-1= 37.904 kJ mol–1(c) Heat CapacityIn this sub-section, let us see how to measure heat transferred to a system. This heat \nappears as a rise in temperature of the system \nin case of heat absorbed by the system. The increase of temperature is proportional to the heat transferred qcoeffT\u001f\u001e\u001dThe magnitude of the coefficient depends on the size, composition and nature of the system. We can also write it as q = C ∆TThe coefficient, C is called the heat capacity. Thus, we can measure the heat supplied by monitoring the temperature rise, provided \nwe know the heat capacity. When C is large, a given amount of heat results in only a small temperature rise. Water \nhas a large heat capacity i.e., a lot of energy \nis needed to raise its temperature. C is directly proportional to amount of substance. The molar heat capacity of a substance, Cm=Cn\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a, is the heat capacity for one mole of the substance and is the quantity of heat needed to raise the \ntemperature of one mole by one degree �celsius (or one kelvin). Specific heat, also �called specific heat capacity is the quantity Fig. 5.6(a)  A gas at volume V and temperature TFig. 5.6 (b) Partition, each part having half the \nvolume of the gas(b) Extensive and Intensive PropertiesIn thermodynamics, a distinction is made   between extensive properties and intensive \nproperties. An extensive property is a property whose value depends on the quantity \nor size of matter present in the system. For \nexample, mass, volume, internal energy, \nenthalpy, heat capacity, etc. are extensive \nproperties.Those properties which do not depend on the quantity or size of matter present \nare known as intensive properties. For example temperature, density, pressure etc. \nare intensive properties. A molar property, χm, is the value of an extensive property χ of the system for 1 mol of the substance. If n is the amount of matter, \u001f\u001fm\u001en is independent of the amount of matter. Other examples are molar volume, Vm and molar heat capacity, Cm. Let us understand the distinction between extensive and intensive properties by \nconsidering a gas enclosed in a container of \nvolume V and at temperature T [Fig. 5.6(a)]. Let us make a partition such that volume \nis halved, each part [Fig. 5.6 (b)] now has one half of the original volume, V2, but the temperature will still remain the same i.e., T. It is clear that volume is an extensive property and temperature is an intensive property.

For finding out the \nheat, q, required to raise the temperatures of a sample, we multiply the specific heat \nof the substance, c, by the mass m, and \ntemperatures change, ∆T  as     qcmTCT\u001f\u001e\u001e\u001f\u001d\u001d                   (5.11)(d) The Relationship between Cp and CV   for an Ideal Gas At constant volume, the heat capacity, C is  \ndenoted by CV  and at constant pressure, this is denoted by Cp .

Knowing \nthe heat capacity of the liquid in which \ncalorimeter is immersed and the heat capacity \nof calorimeter, it is possible to determine the \nheat evolved in the process by measuring \ntemperature changes. Measurements are \nmade under two different conditions: i)   at constant volume,  qV ii)  at constant pressure,  qp(a) ∆U MeasurementsFor chemical reactions, heat absorbed at constant volume, is measured in a bomb \ncalorimeter (Fig. 5.7). Here, a steel vessel (the \nbomb) is immersed in a water bath. The whole \ndevice is called calorimeter. The steel vessel is \nimmersed in water bath to ensure that no heat \nis lost to the surroundings. A combustible  Fig. 5.7  Bomb calorimetersubstance is burnt in pure dioxygen supplied in the steel bomb. Heat evolved during the reaction is transferred to the water around the \nbomb and its temperature is monitored. Since \nthe bomb calorimeter is sealed, its volume \ndoes not change i.e., the energy changes \nassociated with reactions are measured at \nconstant volume. Under these conditions, no \nwork is done as the reaction is carried out \nat constant volume in the bomb calorimeter. \nEven for reactions involving gases, there is no \nwork done as ∆V = 0. Temperature change of \nthe calorimeter produced by the completed \nreaction is then converted to qV, by using the known heat capacity of the calorimeter with \nthe help of equation 5.11. Unit 5.indd   1459/12/2022   11:53:39 AM146(B) ∆H MeasurementsMeasurement of heat change at constant pressure (generally under atmospheric pressure) \ncan be done in a calorimeter shown in Fig. 5.8. \nWe know that ∆Η = qp (at constant p) and, therefore, heat absorbed or evolved, qp at constant pressure is also called the heat of \nreaction or enthalpy of reaction, ∆rH. In an exothermic reaction, heat is evolved, and system loses heat to the surroundings. Therefore, qp will be negative and ∆rH will also be negative. Similarly in an endothermic \nreaction, heat is absorbed, qp is positive and ∆rH will be positive.

The enthalpy change of a chemical reaction, is given by the symbol ∆rH∆rH = (sum of enthalpies of products) – (sum                                   of enthalpies of reactants)\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001daiproductsireactantsiiHbH (5.14)Here symbol ∑��������������������i and bi are the stoichiometric Unit 5.indd   1469/12/2022   11:53:40 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         147coefficients of the products and reactants respectively in the balanced chemical \nequation. For example, for the reactionCH4 (g)  +  2O2 (g)   →   CO2 (g)  + 2H2O (l)=−∑∑riProductsireactantsiiHaHbH∆       = [Hm (CO2, g) + 2Hm  (H2O, l)]– [Hm (CH4, g)+ 2Hm (O2, g)]where Hm is the molar enthalpy.Enthalpy change is a very useful quantity.  Knowledge of this quantity is required when one needs to plan the heating or cooling \nrequired to maintain an industrial chemical \nreaction at constant temperature. It is also \nrequired to calculate temperature dependence \nof equilibrium constant.(a) Standard Enthalpy of ReactionsEnthalpy of a reaction depends on the conditions under which a reaction is carried \nout. It is, therefore, necessary that we \nmust specify some standard conditions. The standard enthalpy of reaction is the �enthalpy change for a reaction when all \nthe participating substances are in their \nstandard states.The standard state of a substance at a specified temperature is its pure form at  1 bar. For example, the standard state of liquid ethanol at 298 K is pure liquid ethanol at  1 bar; standard state of solid iron at 500 K is pure iron at 1 bar. Usually data are taken \nat 298 K.Standard conditions are denoted by adding the superscript  to the symbol ∆H, e.g., ∆H(b) Enthalpy Changes during Phase TransformationsPhase transformations also involve energy changes. Ice, for example, requires heat for \nmelting. Normally this melting takes place at constant pressure (atmospheric pressure) and \nduring phase change, temperature remains \nconstant (at 273 K).H2O(s) → H2O(l); ∆fusH = 6.00 kJ moI–1Here ∆fusH is enthalpy of fusion in standard state. If water freezes, then process is reversed and equal amount of heat is given off to the \nsurroundings. The enthalpy change that accompanies melting of one mole of a solid substance  in \nstandard state is called standard enthalpy \nof fusion or molar enthalpy of fusion, �∆fusH.Melting of a solid is endothermic, so all enthalpies of fusion are positive. Water Table 5.1  Standard Enthalpy Changes of Fusion and Vaporisation(Tf and Tb are melting and boiling points, respectively)Unit 5.indd   1479/12/2022   11:53:40 AM148requires heat for evaporation. At constant temperature of its boiling point Tb and at constant pressure:H2O(l) → H2O(g); ∆vapH = + 40.79 kJ moI–1 ∆vapH is the standard enthalpy of vaporisation.Amount of heat required to vaporize one mole of a liquid at constant temperature and under standard pressure (1bar) is called �its standard enthalpy of vaporization or �molar enthalpy of vaporization, ∆vapH. Sublimation is direct conversion of a solid into its vapour. Solid CO2 or ‘dry ice’ sublimes at 195K with ∆subH=25.2 kJ mol–1; naphthalene sublimes slowly and for this  ∆sub H = 73.0 kJ mol–1 .Standard enthalpy of sublimation, ∆subH is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a solid substance sublimes at a \nconstant temperature and under standard \npressure (1bar).The magnitude of the enthalpy change depends on the strength of the intermolecular \ninteractions in the substance undergoing \nthe phase transfomations. For example, \nthe strong hydrogen bonds between water \nmolecules hold them tightly in liquid phase. \nFor an organic liquid, such as acetone, the \nintermolecular dipole-dipole interactions are �significantly weaker. Thus, it requires less \nheat to vaporise 1 mol of acetone than it does \nto vaporize 1 mol of water. Table 5.1 gives \nvalues of standard enthalpy changes of fusion \nand vaporisation for some substances.SolutionWe can represent the process of evaporation as vaporisation22 HO(1)HO(g)1mol1mol →No. of moles in 18 g H2O(l) is –118g==1 mol18g molHeat supplied to evaporate18g water at 298 K = n × ∆vap H  = (1 mol) × (44.01 kJ mol–1)  = 44.01 kJ(assuming steam behaving as an ideal \ngas).∆vapU = ∆vapH – p∆V = ∆vapH – ∆ngRT ∆vapHV – ∆ngRT = 44.01 kJ       –(1)(8.314 JK–1mol–1)(298K)(10–3kJ J–1)∆vapUV = 44.01 kJ – 2.48kJ          = 41.53 kJ\nProblem 5.8Assuming the water vapour to be a perfect gas, calculate the internal energy change \nwhen 1 mol of water at 100°C and 1 bar \npressure is converted to ice at 0°C.

Calculate the internal energy \nof vaporisation at 298K. ∆vap H for waterat 298K= 44.01kJ mol–1Unit 5.indd   1489/12/2022   11:53:40 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         149of aggregation (also known as reference states)  is called Standard Molar Enthalpy of Formation. Its symbol is ∆fH, where the subscript ‘ f ’ indicates that one mole of the compound in question has been formed in its \nstandard state from its elements in their most \nstable states of aggregation. The reference \nstate of an element is its most stable state \nof aggregation at 25°C and 1 bar pressure.  For example, the reference state of dihydrogen \nis H2 gas and those of dioxygen, carbon and sulphur are O2 gas, Cgraphite and Srhombic respectively. Some reactions with standard \nmolar enthalpies of formation are as follows. Table 5.2 Standard Molar Enthalpies of Formation (∆f H) at 298K of a Few  Selected SubstancesTherefore,  ∆H = - 7.56 kJ mol-1 + (-6.00 kJ mol-1)                = -13.56 kJ mol-1 There is negligible change in the volume during the change form liquid to solid state.Therefore, p∆v = ∆ng RT = 0∆H = ∆U = - 13.56kJ mol-1(c) Standard Enthalpy of Formation The standard enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of a compound from \nits elements in their most stable states Unit 5.indd   1499/12/2022   11:53:40 AM150H2(g) + ½O2 (g) → H2O(1);∆f H = –285.8 kJ mol–1C (graphite, s) + 2H2(g) → Ch4 (g);∆f H = –74.81 kJ mol–12C (graphite, s)+3H2 (g)+ ½O2(g) → C2H5OH(1);∆f H  = – 277.7kJ mol–1It is important to understand that a standard molar enthalpy of formation, ∆fH , is just a special case of ∆rH , where one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements, as in the above three equations, \nwhere 1 mol of each, water, methane and \nethanol is formed. In contrast, the enthalpy \nchange for an exothermic reaction:CaO(s) + CO2(g) → CaCo3(s);∆rH  = – 178.3kJ mol–1is not an enthalpy of formation of calcium carbonate, since calcium carbonate has been \nformed from other compounds, and not from \nits constituent elements. Also, for the reaction \ngiven below, enthalpy change is not standard \nenthalpy of formation, ∆fH  for HBr(g).H2(g) + Br2(l) → 2HBr(g); ∆r H  = – 178.3kJ mol–1Here two moles, instead of one mole of the product is formed from the elements, i.e., ∆r H  = 2∆f HTherefore, by dividing all coefficients in the balanced equation by 2, expression for enthalpy of formation of HBr (g) is written as \n½H2(g) + ½Br2(1) → HBr(g);∆f H = – 36.4 kJ mol–1Standard enthalpies of formation of some common substances are given in Table 5.2.By convention, standard enthalpy for formation, ∆fH, of an element in reference state, i.e., its most stable state of aggregation \nis taken as zero. Suppose, you are a chemical engineer and want to know how much heat is required to \ndecompose calcium carbonate to lime and \ncarbon dioxide, with all the substances in \ntheir standard state. CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g); ∆r H  = ?Here, we can make use of standard enthalpy \nof formation and calculate the enthalpy \nchange for the reaction. The following general \nequation can be used for the enthalpy change \ncalculation. ∆rH = i∑ai ∆f H (products) – i∑bi ∆f H (reactants)                 (5.15)where a and b represent the coefficients of the products and reactants in the balanced equation. Let us apply the above equation for \ndecomposition of calcium carbonate. Here, �coefficients ‘a’ and ‘b’ are 1 each. Therefore,∆rH = ∆f H  = [CaO(s)]+ ∆f H  [CO2(g)]– ∆f H  = [CaCO3(s)]=1 (–635.1 kJ mol–1) + 1(–393.5 kJ mol–1)–1(–1206.9 kJ mol–1)= 178.3 kJ mol–1Thus, the decomposition of CaCO3 (s) is an endothermic process and you have to heat it for getting the desired products. (d) Thermochemical EquationsA balanced chemical equation together with the value of its ∆rH is called a thermochemical equation. We specify the physical state \n(alongwith allotropic state) of the substance \nin an equation. For example: C2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l);∆rH = – 1367 kJ mol–1The above equation describes the combustion of liquid ethanol at constant temperature and pressure. The negative sign \nof enthalpy change indicates that this is an exothermic reaction. It would be necessary to remember the following conventions regarding thermo-chemical equations. 1. The coefficients in a balanced thermo-\nchemical equation refer to the number of \nmoles (never molecules) of reactants and products involved in the reaction. 2. The numerical value of ∆rH refers to the number of moles of substances specified \nby an equation. Standard enthalpy change �∆rH will have units as kJ mol–1. Unit 5.indd   1509/12/2022   11:53:40 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         151To illustrate the concept, let us consider the calculation of heat of reaction for the following  reaction :FeOsHgFesHOl2322323\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001e\u001c\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001e,From the Table (5.2) of standard enthalpy of \nformation (∆f H), we find :∆f H (H2O,l) = –285.83 kJ mol–1;∆f H (Fe2O3,s)  = – 824.2 kJ mol–1; Also  ∆f H (Fe, s) = 0 and         ∆f H (H2, g) = 0 as per conventionThen, ∆f H1 = 3(–285.83 kJ mol–1)                                  – 1(– 824.2 kJ mol–1)         =  (–857.5 + 824.2) kJ mol–1               =  –33.3 kJ mol–1Note that the coefficients used in these calculations are pure numbers, which \nare equal to the respective stoichiometric \ncoefficients. The unit for ∆rH is  kJ mol–1, which means per mole of reaction. Once we balance the chemical equation in a �particular way, as above, this defines the mole of reaction. If we had balanced the equation \ndifferently, for example,12323\n22322FeOsHgFesHOl\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001e\u001c\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001ethen this amount of reaction would be one \nmole of reaction and ∆rH would be∆f H2 = 32(–285.83 kJ mol–1)          – 12(–824.2 kJ mol–1)  = (– 428.7 + 412.1) kJ mol–1= –16.6 kJ mol–1 =  ½ ∆r H1 It shows that enthalpy is an extensive \nquantity.3. When a chemical equation is reversed, the value of ∆rH is reversed in sign. For exampleN2(g) + 3H2 (g) → 2NH3 (g);∆r H = – 91.8 kJ. mol–12NH3(g) → N2(g) + 3H2 (g);∆r H = + 91.8 kJ mol–1(e) Hess’s Law of Constant Heat \nSummation We know that enthalpy is a state function, \ntherefore the change in enthalpy is independent  of the path between initial state (reactants) �and final state (products). In other words, \nenthalpy change for a reaction is the same \nwhether it occurs in one step or in a series \nof steps. This may be stated as follows in the �form of Hess’s Law.If a reaction takes place in several steps then its standard reaction enthalpy \nis the sum of the standard enthalpies of �the intermediate reactions into which the overall reaction may be divided at the same \ntemperature.Let us understand the importance of this law with the help of an example.Consider the enthalpy change for the reactionC (graphite,s) +  O2 (g) → CO (g); ∆r H  = ?Although CO(g) is the major product, some CO2 gas is always produced in this reaction. Therefore, we cannot measure enthalpy change for the above reaction directly. �However, if we can find some other reactions \ninvolving related species, it is possible to \ncalculate the enthalpy change for the above \nreaction. Let us consider the following reactions:  C (graphite,s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g); ∆r H = – 393.5 kJ mol–1 (i)CO (g) + 12O2 (g) → CO2 (g)∆r H = – 283.0 kJ mol–1 (ii)We can combine the above two reactions in such a way so as to obtain the desired reaction. To get one mole of CO(g) on the \nright, we reverse equation (ii). In this, heat \nis absorbed instead of being released, so we \nchange sign of ∆rH valueCO2 (g) → CO (g) +  O2 (g);∆r H = + 283.0 kJ mol–1 (iii)         Unit 5.indd   1519/12/2022   11:53:41 AM152Adding equation (i) and (iii), we get the desired equation, CgraphitesOgCOg,;\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001e\u001c\u001f\u001e122for which ∆r H  = (– 393.5 + 283.0)= – 110.5 kJ mol–1In general, if enthalpy of an overall reaction A→B along one route is ∆rH and ∆rH1, ∆rH2, ∆rH3..... representing enthalpies of reactions leading to same product, B along another route, then we have∆rH = ∆rH1 + ∆rH2 + ∆rH3 ... (5.16) It can be represented as: 5.5 ENTHALPIES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF REACTIONSIt is convenient to give name to enthalpies specifying the types of reactions.(a) Standard Enthalpy of Combustion (symbol : ∆cH)Combustion reactions are exothermic in \nnature. These are important in industry, \nrocketry, and other walks of life. Standard �enthalpy of combustion is defined as the \nenthalpy change per mole (or per unit amount) \nof a substance, when it undergoes combustion \nand all the reactants and products being \nin their standard states at the specified \ntemperature. Cooking gas in cylinders contains mostly butane (C4H10). During complete combustion of one mole of butane, 2658 kJ of heat is released. We can write the thermochemical \nreactions for this as: CHgOgCOgHO410222132451()()()();\u001f\u001e\u001f∆C H  = – 2658.0 kJ mol–1Similarly, combustion of glucose gives out 2802.0 kJ/mol of heat, for which the overall \nequation is :CHOgOgCOgHO61262226661()()()();\u001f\u001e\u001f∆C H  = – 2802.0 kJ mol–1Our body also generates energy from food by the same overall process as combustion, �although the final products are produced after \na series of complex bio-chemical reactions \ninvolving enzymes.ABCD∆H1∆rH2∆rH3∆rHProblem 5.9The combustion of one mole of benzene takes place at 298 K and 1 atm. After \ncombustion, CO2(g) and H2O (1) are produced and 3267.0 kJ of heat is \nliberated. Calculate the standard \nenthalpy of formation, ∆f H of benzene. Standard enthalpies of formation of \nCO2(g) and H2O(l) are –393.5 kJ mol–1 and – 285.83 kJ mol–1 respectively.

(iv)In this case, the enthalpy of atomization is same as the enthalpy of sublimation.(c) Bond Enthalpy (symbol: ∆bondH)Chemical reactions involve the breaking and making of chemical bonds. Energy is required \nto break a bond and energy is released when a \nbond is formed. It is possible to relate heat of \nreaction to changes in energy associated with \nbreaking and making of chemical bonds. With \nreference to the enthalpy changes associated \nwith chemical bonds, two different terms are \nused in thermodynamics. (i) Bond dissociation enthalpy(ii) Mean bond enthalpyLet us discuss these terms with reference to diatomic and polyatomic molecules.Diatomic Molecules: Consider the following process in which the bonds in one mole of \ndihydrogen gas (H2) are broken:H2(g)  →  2H(g);  ∆H–HH  = 435.0 kJ mol–1The enthalpy change involved in this process \nis the bond dissociation enthalpy of H–H \nbond. The bond dissociation enthalpy is the \nchange in enthalpy when one mole of covalent \nbonds of a gaseous covalent compound is \nbroken to form products in the gas phase.Note that it is the same as the enthalpy of atomization of dihydrogen. This is true for all \ndiatomic molecules. For example:Cl2(g)  →  2Cl(g);  ∆Cl–ClH  = 242 kJ mol–1O2(g)  →  2O(g);  ∆O=OH  = 428 kJ mol–1In the case of polyatomic molecules, bond dissociation enthalpy is different for different bonds within the same molecule.Polyatomic Molecules: Let us now consider a polyatomic molecule like methane, CH4. The overall thermochemical equation for its \natomization reaction is given below: 4CH(g)C(g)4H(g);→+∆a H  = 1665 kJ mol–1In methane, all the four C – H bonds are identical in bond length and energy. However, \nthe energies required to break the individual \nC – H bonds in each successive step differ :(b) Enthalpy of Atomization  \n(symbol: ∆aH)Consider the following example of atomization of dihydrogen H2(g)  →  2H(g);  ∆aH = 435.0 kJ mol–1You can see that H atoms are formed by breaking H–H bonds in dihydrogen. The \nenthalpy change in this process is known \nas enthalpy of atomization, ∆aH. It is the enthalpy change on breaking one mole of \nbonds completely to obtain atoms in the gas \nphase.In case of diatomic molecules, like dihydrogen (given above), the enthalpy of \natomization is also the bond dissociation \nenthalpy. The other examples of enthalpy of \natomization can be CH4(g)  →  C(g) + 4H(g); ∆aH  = 1665 kJ mol–1Note that the products are only atoms of C and H in gaseous phase. Now see the following reaction:Na(s)  →  Na(g);  ∆aH  = 108.4 kJ mol–1Unit 5.indd   1539/12/2022   11:53:42 AM154CH4(g) → CH3(g)+H(g);∆bond H = +427 kJ mol–1CH3(g) → CH2(g)+H(g);∆bond H = +439 kJ mol–1CH2(g) → CH(g)+H(g);∆bond H = +452 kJ mol–1CH(g) → C(g)+H(g);∆bond H = +347 kJ mol–1Therefore,CH4(g) → C(g)+4H(g);∆a H = 1665 kJ mol–1In such cases we use mean bond enthalpy of C – H bond.For example in CH4, ∆C–HH  is calculated as: ∆C–HH = ¼ (∆a H) = ¼ (1665 kJ mol–1)                              = 416 kJ mol–1We find that mean C–H bond enthalpy in methane is 416 kJ/mol. It has been \nfound that mean C–H bond enthalpies differ \nslightly from compound to compound, as \nin CH3CH2Cl, CH3NO2, etc., but it does not differ in a great deal*. Using Hess’s law, bond \nenthalpies can be calculated. Bond enthalpy \nvalues of some single and multiple bonds are given in Table 5.3. The reaction enthalpies are \nvery important quantities as these arise from \nthe changes that accompany the breaking of \nold bonds and formation of the new bonds. \nWe can predict enthalpy of a reaction in gas \nphase, if we know different bond enthalpies. \nThe standard enthalpy of reaction, ∆rH is related to bond enthalpies of the reactants \nand products in gas phase reactions as:∆r H       (5.17)**This relationship is particularly more useful when the required values of ∆f H are not available. The net enthalpy change of a reaction is the amount of energy required \nto break all the bonds in the reactant \nmolecules minus the amount of energy \nrequired to break all the bonds in the product \nmolecules.

(d)  Lattice EnthalpyThe lattice enthalpy of an ionic compound is the enthalpy change which occurs when one \nmole of an ionic compound dissociates into \nits ions in gaseous state.NaClsNagClg\u001f\u001e\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001f\u001d\u001c();  ∆latticeH = +788 kJ mol–1Since it is impossible to determine lattice enthalpies directly by experiment, we use an indirect method where we construct an enthalpy diagram called a Born-Haber Cycle (Fig. 5.9).Let us now calculate the lattice enthalpy of Na+Cl–(s) by following steps given below : 1. NasNag()()→, sublimation of sodium  metal, ∆subH = 108.4 kJ mol–12.

You have learnt about ionization enthalpy and electron gain enthalpy in Unit 3. In fact, these terms have been taken \nfrom thermodynamics. Earlier terms, �ionization energy and electron affinity \nwere in practice in place of the above �terms (see the box for justification).Fig. 5.9  Enthalpy diagram for lattice enthalpy of NaCl5.

Therefore the solubility of \nmost salts in water increases with rise of temperature. If the lattice enthalpy is very \nhigh, the dissolution of the compound may �not take place at all. Why do many fluorides \ntend to be less soluble than the corresponding \nchlorides? Estimates of the magnitudes of \nenthalpy changes may be made by using \ntables of bond energies (enthalpies) and lattice \nenergies (enthalpies).(f)   Enthalpy of Dilution It is known that enthalpy of solution is the enthalpy change associated with the addition of a specified amount of solute to the specified \namount of solvent at a constant temperature \nand pressure. This argument can be applied \nto any solvent with slight modification. \nEnthalpy change for dissolving one mole of \ngaseous hydrogen chloride in 10 mol of water \ncan be represented by the following equation. \nFor convenience we will use the symbol aq. \nfor water HCl(g) + 10 aq. → HCl.10 aq.  ∆H = –69.01 kJ / molLet us consider the following set of enthalpy changes:\n(S-1) HCl(g) + 25 aq. → HCl.25 aq.  ∆H = –72.03 kJ / mol (S-2) HCl(g) + 40 aq. → HCl.40 aq.  ∆H = –72.79 kJ / mol(S-3) HCl(g) +  ∞ aq. → HCl. ∞ aq.  ∆H = –74.85 kJ / molThe values of ∆H show general dependence of the enthalpy of solution on amount of solvent. As more and more solvent is used, the enthalpy of solution approaches a limiting \nvalue, i.e, the value in infinitely dilute \nsolution. For hydrochloric acid this value of �∆H is given above in equation (S-3). cycle. The importance of the cycle is that, the sum of the enthalpy changes round a \ncycle is zero. Applying Hess’s law, we get,∆latticeH = 411.2 + 108.4 + 121 + 496 – 348.6∆latticeH = + 788kJfor NaCl(s)  Na+(g) + Cl–(g)Internal energy is smaller by 2RT (because ∆ng = 2) and is equal to + 783 kJ mol–1.Now we use the value of lattice enthalpy to calculate enthalpy of solution from the \nexpression:∆solH = ∆latticeH + ∆hydH For one mole of NaCl(s), lattice enthalpy  = + 788 kJ mol–1and ∆hydH = – 784 kJ mol–1( from the   literature)∆sol H = + 788 kJ mol–1 – 784 kJ mol–1            = + 4 kJ mol–1The dissolution of NaCl(s) is accompanied by very little heat change. (e)   Enthalpy of Solution (symbol : ∆solH )Enthalpy of solution of a substance is the enthalpy change when one mole of it dissolves �in a specified amount of solvent. The enthalpy �of solution at infinite dilution is the enthalpy \nchange observed on dissolving the substance �in an infinite amount of solvent when the \ninteractions between the ions (or solute \nmolecules) are negligible. When an ionic compound dissolves in a solvent, the ions leave their ordered positions \non the crystal lattice. These are now more free in \nsolution. But solvation of these ions (hydration \nin case solvent is water) also occurs at the same time. This is shown diagrammatically, for an ionic compound, AB (s) Unit 5.indd   1569/12/2022   11:53:43 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         157If we subtract the first equation (equation S-1) from the second equation (equation S-2) in the above set of equations, we obtain– HCl.25 aq. + 15 aq. → HCl.40 aq.  ∆H = [ –72.79 – (–72.03)] kJ / mol       = – 0.76 kJ / mol This value (–0.76kJ/mol) of ∆H is enthalpy of dilution. It is the heat withdrawn from the surroundings when additional solvent is \nadded to the solution. The enthalpy of dilution \nof a solution is dependent on the original \nconcentration of the solution and the amount \nof solvent added. 5.6 SPONTANEITYThe first law of thermodynamics tells us about the relationship between the heat absorbed and the work performed on or \nby a system. It puts no restrictions on \nthe direction of heat flow. However, the �flow of heat is unidirectional from higher \ntemperature to lower temperature. In fact, \nall naturally occurring processes whether \nchemical or physical will tend to proceed \nspontaneously in one direction only. For �example, a gas expanding to fill the available \nvolume, burning carbon in dioxygen giving \ncarbon dioxide. But heat will not flow from colder body to warmer body on its own, the gas in a container \nwill not spontaneously contract into one \ncorner or carbon dioxide will not form carbon \nand dioxygen spontaneously. These and many \nother spontaneously occurring changes show \nunidirectional change. We may ask ‘what is \nthe driving force of spontaneously occurring \nchanges ? What determines the direction of a \nspontaneous change ? In this section, we shall \nestablish some criterion for these processes \nwhether these will take place or not.Let us first understand what do we mean by spontaneous reaction or change ? You \nmay think by your common observation that \nspontaneous reaction is one which occurs \nimmediately when contact is made between \nthe reactants. Take the case of combination \nof hydrogen and oxygen. These gases may \nbe mixed at room temperature and left for many years without observing any perceptible \nchange. Although the reaction is taking place \nbetween them, it is at an extremely slow \nrate. It is still called spontaneous reaction. \nSo spontaneity means ‘having the potential \nto proceed without the assistance of external \nagency’. However, it does not tell about the \nrate of the reaction or process. Another aspect \nof spontaneous reaction or process, as we see \nis that these cannot reverse their direction on \ntheir own. We may summarise it as  follows: A spontaneous process is an  \nirreversible process and may only be \nreversed by some external agency.(a)  Is Decrease in Enthalpy a Criterion   for Spontaneity ?If we examine the phenomenon like flow of \nwater down hill or fall of a stone on to the �ground, we find that there is a net decrease \nin potential energy in the direction of change. \nBy analogy, we may be tempted to state that  \na chemical reaction is spontaneous in a \ngiven direction, because decrease in energy \nhas taken place, as in the case of exothermic \nreactions. For example:12N2(g) + H2(g) = NH3(g);                                        ∆r H  = – 46.1 kJ mol–112H2(g) + 12Cl2(g) = HCl (g);                                    ∆r H  = – 92.32 kJ mol–1H2(g) + 12 O2(g) → H2O(l) ;                                    ∆r H  = –285.8 kJ mol–1The decrease in enthalpy in passing from reactants to products may be shown for any \nexothermic reaction on an enthalpy diagram \nas shown in Fig. 5.10(a). Thus, the postulate that driving force for a chemical reaction may be due to decrease \nin energy sounds ‘reasonable’ as the basis of \nevidence so far !Now let us examine the following reactions:12 N2(g) + O2(g) → NO2(g);                                        ∆r H = +33.2 kJ mol–1C(graphite, s) + 2 S(l) → CS2(l);                                       ∆r H = +128.5 kJ mol–1Unit 5.indd   1579/12/2022   11:53:43 AM158These reactions  though endothermic, are spontaneous. The increase in enthalpy may be represented on an enthalpy diagram as \nshown in Fig. 5.10(b).Fig. 5.10 (a) Enthalpy diagram for exothermic \nreactionsFig. 5.10 (b) Enthalpy diagram for endothermic \nreactionsFig. 5.11  Diffusion of two gasesrespectively and separated by a movable \npartition [Fig. 5.11 (a)]. When the partition is \nwithdrawn [Fig. 5.11(b)], the gases begin to \ndiffuse into each other and after a period of \ntime, diffusion will be complete.Let us examine the process. Before partition, if we were to pick up the gas \nmolecules from left container, we would be \nsure that these will be molecules of gas A \nand similarly if we were to pick up the gas \nmolecules from right container, we would \nbe sure that these will be molecules of gas \nB. But, if we were to pick up molecules from \ncontainer when partition is removed, we are \nnot sure whether the molecules picked are of \ngas A or gas B. We say that the system has \nbecome less predictable or more chaotic. We may now formulate another postulate:  in an isolated system, there is always a \ntendency for the systems’ energy to become \nmore disordered or chaotic and this could be \na criterion for spontaneous change !At this point, we introduce another thermodynamic function, entropy denoted \nas S. The above mentioned disorder is the manifestation of entropy. To form a mental Therefore, it becomes obvious that while decrease in enthalpy may be a contributory \nfactor for spontaneity, but it is not true for \nall cases.(b) Entropy and Spontaneity\nThen, what drives the spontaneous process in a given direction ?  Let us examine such a \ncase in which ∆H = 0 i.e., there is no change in enthalpy, but still the process is spontaneous.Let us consider diffusion of two gases into each other in a closed container which \nis isolated from the surroundings as shown \nin Fig. 5.11. The two gases, say, gas A and gas B are represented by black dots and white dots Unit 5.indd   1589/12/2022   11:53:47 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         159picture, one can think of entropy as a measure of the degree of randomness or disorder in the \nsystem. The greater the disorder in an isolated \nsystem, the higher is the entropy.  As far as a \nchemical reaction is concerned, this entropy \nchange  can be attributed to rearrangement of \natoms or ions from one pattern in the reactants \nto another (in the products). If the structure \nof the products is very much disordered than \nthat of the reactants, there will be a resultant \nincrease in entropy. The change in entropy \naccompanying a chemical reaction may be \nestimated qualitatively by a consideration of \nthe structures of the species taking part in the \nreaction. Decrease of regularity in structure \nwould mean increase in entropy. For a given \nsubstance, the crystalline solid state is the \nstate of lowest entropy (most ordered), The \ngaseous state is state of highest entropy.Now let us try to quantify entropy. One way to calculate the degree of disorder or chaotic \ndistribution of energy among molecules \nwould be through statistical method which \nis beyond the scope of this treatment. Other \nway would be to relate this process to the \nheat involved in a process which would make \nentropy a thermodynamic concept. Entropy, \nlike any other thermodynamic property such \nas internal energy U and enthalpy H is a state function and ∆S is independent of path.Whenever heat is added to the system, it increases molecular motions causing \nincreased randomness in the system. Thus \nheat (q) has randomising influence on the \nsystem. Can we then equate ∆S with q ? Wait ! Experience suggests us that the distribution \nof heat also depends on the temperature at \nwhich heat is added to the system. A system at \nhigher temperature has greater randomness \nin it  than one at lower temperature. Thus, temperature is the measure of average \nchaotic motion of particles in the system. \nHeat added to a system at lower temperature \ncauses greater randomness than when the \nsame quantity of heat is added to it at higher \ntemperature. This suggests that the entropy \nchange is inversely proportional to the \ntemperature. ∆S is related with q and T for a reversible reaction as : ∆S =qTrev (5.18)The total entropy change (∆Stotal) for the system and surroundings of a spontaneous \nprocess is given by\u001f\u001f\u001fSSStotalsystemsurr\u001e\u001d\u001c0                   (5.19)When a system is in equilibrium, the entropy is maximum, and the change in \nentropy, ∆S = 0.We can say that entropy for a spontaneous process increases till it reaches maximum \nand at equilibrium the change in entropy is \nzero. Since entropy is a state property, we can \ncalculate the change in entropy of a reversible \nprocess by∆Ssys = qsysrev,T  We find that both for reversible and irreversible expansion for an ideal gas, under isothermal conditions, ∆U = 0,  but ∆Stotal  i.e., \u001f\u001fSSsyssurr\u001eis not zero for irreversible process. Thus,  ∆U does not discriminate between reversible and irreversible process, whereas ∆S does.Problem 5.10Predict in which of the following, entropy increases/decreases :(i) A liquid crystallizes into a solid.(ii) Temperature of a crystalline solid is raised from 0 K to 115 K.iiiNaHCOsNaCOsCOgHOg\u001f\u001e\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001e\u001c\u001f\u001e\u001c\u001f\u001e232322(iv) HgHg22\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001eSolution(i) After freezing, the molecules attain \nan ordered state and therefore, \nentropy decreases.(ii) At 0 K, the contituent particles are \nstatic and entropy is minimum. \nIf temperature is raised to 115 K, these begin to move and oscillate Unit 5.indd   1599/12/2022   11:53:48 AM160about their equilibrium positions in the lattice and system becomes \nmore disordered, therefore entropy \nincreases.(iii) Reactant, NaHCO3 is a solid and it has low entropy.

But most of \nthe chemical reactions fall into the category \nof either closed systems or open systems. \nTherefore, for most of the chemical reactions \nthere are changes in both enthalpy and \nentropy. It is clear from the discussion in \nprevious sections that neither decrease in \nenthalpy nor increase in entropy alone can \ndetermine the direction of spontaneous \nchange for these systems.For this purpose, we define a new thermodynamic function the Gibbs energy \nor Gibbs function, G, as G = H – TS                                      (5.20)Gibbs function, G is an extensive property and a state function.The change in Gibbs energy for the system, ∆Gsys can be written as\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001fGHTSSTsyssyssyssys=\u001e\u001eAt constant temperature, \u001f\u001e\u001d\u001d\u001dGHTSsyssyssys= Usually the subscript ‘system’ is dropped and we simply write this equation as  \u001f\u001f\u001fGHTS\u001e\u001d                                 (5.21)Thus, Gibbs energy change = enthalpy change – temperature × entropy change, and is referred to as the Gibbs equation, one of \nthe most important equations in chemistry. \nHere, we have considered both terms together \nfor spontaneity: energy (in terms of ∆H) and entropy (∆S, a measure of disorder) as \nindicated earlier. Dimensionally if we analyse, �we find that ∆G has units of energy because, both ∆H and the T∆S are energy terms, since T∆S = (K) (J/K) = J.Now let us consider how ∆G is related to reaction spontaneity.Unit 5.indd   1609/12/2022   11:53:48 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         161We know, ∆Stotal = ∆Ssys +  ∆Ssurr   If the system is in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding, then the temperature of the surrounding is same as that of the system. \nAlso, increase in enthalpy of the surrounding \nis equal to decrease in the enthalpy of the system.Therefore, entropy change of surroundings, \u001f\u001f\u001fSsurr=HTHTsurrsys\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001f\u001fSStotalsys\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016HTsysRearranging the above equation:T∆Stotal  = T∆Ssys – ∆HsysFor spontaneous process, \u001fStotal\u001e0, so              T∆Ssys – ∆Hsys \u003e Ο\u001f\u001e\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001aHTSsyssys0Using equation 5.21, the above equation can be written as–∆G \u003e O\u001f\u001f\u001fGHTS\u001e\u001d\u001c0                                  (5.22)∆Hsys is the enthalpy change of a reaction, T∆Ssys is the energy which is not available to do useful work. So ∆G is the net energy available to do useful work and is thus a measure of the ‘free energy’. For this reason, it is also known as the free energy of the reaction.∆G gives a criteria for spontaneity at constant pressure and temperature.(i) If ∆G is negative (\u003c 0), the process is spontaneous.(ii) If ∆G is positive (\u003e 0), the process is non spontaneous.Note : If a reaction has a positive enthalpy change and positive entropy change, it can be spontaneous when T∆S is large enough to \noutweigh ∆H. This can happen in two ways;  (a) The positive entropy change of the system \ncan be ‘small’ in which case T must be large. (b) The positive entropy change of the \nsystem can be ‘large’, in which case T may be small. The former is one of the reasons \nwhy reactions are often carried out at high \ntemperature. Table 5.4 summarises the effect \nof temperature on spontaneity of reactions.(d) Entropy and Second Law of ThermodynamicsWe know that for an isolated system \nthe change in energy remains constant. Therefore, increase in entropy in such \nsystems is the natural direction of a \nspontaneous change. This, in fact is the �second law of thermodynamics. Like first \nlaw of thermodynamics, second law can also \nbe stated in several ways. The second law of \nthermodynamics explains why spontaneous \nexothermic reactions are so common. \nIn exothermic reactions heat released \nby the reaction increases the disorder \nof the surroundings and overall entropy \nchange is positive which makes the reaction \nspontaneous.(e) Absolute Entropy and Third Law of Thermodynamics Molecules of a substance may move in a straight line in any direction, they may \nspin like a top and the bonds in the \nmolecules may stretch and compress. \nThese motions of the molecule are called \ntranslational, rotational and vibrational \nmotion respectively. When temperature of \nthe system rises, these motions become \nmore vigorous and entropy increases. On the \nother hand when temperature is lowered, the \nentropy decreases. The entropy of any pure crystalline substance approaches zero as �the temperature approaches absolute zero. �This is called third law of thermodynamics. \nThis is so because there is perfect order in \na crystal at absolute zero. The statement is �confined to pure crystalline solids because \ntheoretical arguments and practical evidences \nhave shown that entropy of solutions and \nsuper cooled liquids is not zero at 0 K. The \nimportance of the third law lies in the fact that it permits the calculation of absolute values \nof entropy of pure substance from thermal \ndata alone. For a pure substance, this can Unit 5.indd   1619/12/2022   11:53:49 AM162Table 5.4  Effect of Temperature on Spontaneity of Reactions∆rH ∆rS      ∆rG Description*– + – Reaction spontaneous at all temperatures– – – (at low T ) Reaction spontaneous at low temperature– – + (at high T ) Reaction nonspontaneous at high temperature+ + + (at low T ) Reaction nonspontaneous at low temperature+ + – (at high T ) Reaction spontaneous at high temperature+ – + (at all T ) Reaction nonspontaneous at all temperatures* The term low temperature and high temperature are relative.

Standard entropies can be used to calculate standard entropy changes by a \nHesss law type of calculation. 5.7 GIBBS ENERGY CHANGE AND EQUILIBRIUMWe have seen how a knowledge of the sign and magnitude of the free energy change of a \nchemical reaction allows:(i) Prediction of the spontaneity of the chemical reaction.(ii) Prediction of the useful work that could be extracted from it.So far we have considered free energy changes in irreversible reactions. Let us now examine the free energy changes in reversible \nreactions.‘Reversible’ under strict thermodynamic sense is a special way of carrying out \na process such that system is at all \ntimes in perfect equilibrium with its \nsurroundings. When applied to a chemical \nreaction, the term ‘reversible’ indicates \nthat a given reaction can proceed in either \ndirection simultaneously, so that a dynamic \nequilibrium is set up. This means that the \nreactions in both the directions should proceed with a decrease in free energy, which seems impossible. It is possible only if at \nequilibrium the free energy of the system is minimum.

In such a case, value of K will be much smaller  than 1 and the reaction is unlikely to form much product. In case of exothermic \nreactions, ∆rH is large and negative, and ∆rG is likely to be large and negative too. In such \ncases, K will be much larger than 1. We may expect strongly exothermic reactions to have a \nlarge K, and hence can go to near completion. ∆rG also depends upon ∆rS, if the changes in the entropy of reaction is also taken into \naccount, the value of K or extent of chemical \nreaction will also be affected, depending upon \nwhether ∆rS is positive or negative.Using equation (5.24),Unit 5.indd   1629/12/2022   11:53:49 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         163(i) It is possible to obtain an estimate of ∆G from the measurement of ∆H and ∆S,  and then calculate K at any temperature for economic yields of the products.(ii) If K is measured directly in the laboratory, value of ∆G at any other temperature can be calculated.Using equation (5.24),= –...13610230383142983\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001dJmolJKmolK–1–1–1  =   2.38Hence K = antilog  2.38 = 2.4 × 102.Problem 5.14At 60°C, dinitrogen tetroxide is 50 per cent dissociated.

For these purposes, we divide \nthe universe into the system and the surroundings. Chemical or physical processes lead to evolution \nor absorption of heat (q), part of which may be converted into work (w). These quantities are related \nthrough the first law of thermodynamics via ∆U = q + w. ∆U,  change in internal energy, depends on initial and final states only and is a state function, whereas q and w depend on the path and are not the state functions. We follow sign conventions of q and w by giving the positive sign to these quantities when these are added to the system. We can measure the transfer of heat from one \nsystem to another which causes the change in temperature. The magnitude of rise in temperature \ndepends on the heat capacity (C) of a substance. Therefore, heat absorbed or evolved is q =  C∆T. Work can be measured by w = –pex∆V, in case of expansion of gases. Under reversible process, we can put pex = p for infinitesimal changes in the volume making wrev = – p dV. In this condition, we can use gas equation, pV = nRT.At constant volume, w = 0, then ∆U = qV , heat transfer at constant volume. But in study of chemical reactions, we usually have constant pressure. We define another state function enthalpy. Enthalpy change, ∆H = ∆U + ∆ngRT, can be found directly from the heat changes at constant pressure, ∆H = qp.There are varieties of enthalpy changes. Changes of phase such as melting, vaporization and sublimation usually occur at constant temperature and can be characterized by enthalpy changes which are always positive. Enthalpy of formation, combustion and other enthalpy changes can be \ncalculated using Hess’s law. Enthalpy change for chemical reactions can be determined by\u001f\u001f\u001frifififHaHbH\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001d\u001c\u001a\u001aproductsreactionsand in gaseous state by∆rH =  Σ bond enthalpies of the reactants – Σ bond enthalpies of the productsFirst law of thermodynamics does not guide us about the direction of chemical reactions i.e., what is the driving force of a chemical reaction. For isolated systems,  ∆U = 0. We define another state function, S, entropy for this purpose. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness. For a spontaneous change, total entropy change is positive. Therefore, for an isolated system, ∆U = 0, ∆S \u003e 0, so entropy change distinguishes a spontaneous change, while energy change does not. Entropy changes can be measured by the equation ∆S = qrevT for a reversible process. qrevT is independent of path.Chemical reactions are generally carried at constant pressure, so we define another state function Gibbs energy, G, which is related to entropy and enthalpy changes of the system by the equation:∆rG = ∆rH – T ∆rSFor a spontaneous change, ∆Gsys \u003c 0 and at equilibrium, ∆Gsys = 0.Standard Gibbs energy change is related to equilibrium constant by∆rG = – RT ln K.K can be calculated from this equation, if we know ∆rG which can be found from . Temperature is an important factor in the equation. Many reactions which are non-spontaneous at low temperature, are made spontaneous at high temperature for systems having positive entropy of reaction.Unit 5.indd   1649/12/2022   11:53:50 AMTHERMODYNAMICS         165EXERCISES5.1 Choose the correct answer.

According to them, the continued \nsubdivisions of matter would ultimately yield atoms \nwhich would not be further divisible. The word ‘atom’  \nhas been derived from the Greek word ‘a-tomio’ which means ‘uncut-able’ or ‘non-divisible’. These earlier ideas \nwere mere speculations and there was no way to test \nthem experimentally. These ideas remained dormant  for \na very long time and were revived again by scientists in \nthe nineteenth century.The atomic theory of matter was first proposed on\ta\tfirm\tscientific\tbasis\tby\tJohn\tDalton,\ta\tBritish\tschool teacher in 1808. His theory, called Dalton’s atomic theory, regarded the atom as the ultimate �particle\tof\tmatter\t(Unit\t1).\tDalton’s\tatomic\ttheory\twas\table to explain the law of conservation of mass, law of \nconstant composition and law of multiple proportion very successfully. However, it failed to explain the results \nof many experiments, for example, it was known that \nsubstances like glass or ebonite when rubbed with silk \nor fur get electrically charged.In this unit we start with the experimental observations made by scientists towards the end of nineteenth and \nbeginning of twentieth century. These established that \natoms are made of sub-atomic particles, i.e., electrons,  \nprotons and neutrons — a concept very different from �that\tof\tDalton.\tObjectivesUnit 2.indd   299/9/2022   4:28:07 PM302.1 DISCOVERY OF SUB-ATOMIC PARTICLESAn insight into the structure of atom was obtained from the experiments on electrical \ndischarge through gases. Before we discuss these results we need to keep in mind a \nbasic rule regarding the behaviour of charged \nparticles : “Like charges repel each other and \nunlike charges attract each other”. 2.1.1 Discovery of Electron In 1830, Michael Faraday showed that if electricity is passed through a solution of an electrolyte, chemical reactions occurred at the \nelectrodes, which resulted in the liberation \nand deposition of matter at the electrodes. \nHe formulated certain laws which you will \nstudy in Class XII. These results suggested \nthe particulate nature of electricity.In mid 1850s many scientists mainly Faraday began to study electrical discharge in partially evacuated tubes, known as \ncathode ray discharge tubes. It is depicted \nin Fig. 2.1. A cathode ray tube is made of \nglass containing two thin pieces of metal, \ncalled electrodes, sealed in it. The electrical \ndischarge through the gases could be \nobserved only at very low pressures and at \nvery high voltages. The pressure of different \ngases could be adjusted by evacuation of the �glass\ttubes.\tWhen\tsufficiently\thigh\tvoltage\tis applied across the electrodes, current �starts\tflowing\tthrough\ta\tstream\tof\tparticles\tmoving in the tube from the negative \nelectrode (cathode) to the positive electrode (anode). These were called cathode rays or \ncathode ray particles.\tThe\tflow\tof\tcurrent\tfrom cathode to anode was further checked \nby making a hole in the anode and coating \nthe tube behind anode with phosphorescent \nmaterial zinc sulphide. When these rays, after passing through anode, strike the zinc \nsulphide coating, a bright spot is developed \non the coating [Fig. 2.1(b)]. Fig. 2.1(a) A cathode ray discharge tubeFig. 2.1(b)  A cathode ray discharge tube with perforated anodeThe results of these experiments are summarised below.(i) The cathode rays start from cathode and move towards the anode.(ii) These rays themselves are not visible \nbut their behaviour can be observed \nwith the help of certain kind of materials �(fluorescent\tor\tphosphorescent)\twhich\tglow when hit by them. Television \npicture tubes are cathode ray tubes \nand television pictures result due to fluorescence\ton\tthe\ttelevision\tscreen\tcoated with certain fluorescent or \nphosphorescent materials.(iii) In the absence of electrical or magnetic �field,\tthese\trays\ttravel\tin\tstraight\tlines\t(Fig. 2.2).(iv) In the presence of electrical or magnetic �field,\tthe\tbehaviour\tof\tcathode\trays\tare\tsimilar to that expected from negatively \ncharged particles, suggesting that \nthe cathode rays consist of negatively charged particles, called electrons.(v) The characteristics of cathode rays \n(electrons) do not depend upon the Unit 2.indd   309/9/2022   4:28:08 PM31material of electrodes and the nature of the gas present in the cathode ray tube. Thus, we can conclude that electrons are \nbasic constituent of all the atoms.2.1.2 Charge to Mass Ratio of ElectronIn\t1897,\tBritish\tphysicist\tJ.J.\tThomson\tmeasured the ratio of electrical charge (e) to the mass of electron (me ) by using cathode ray tube and applying electrical and magnetic �field\tperpendicular\tto\teach\tother\tas\twell\tas\tto the path of electrons (Fig. 2.2). When only �electric\tfield\tis\tapplied,\tthe\telectrons\tdeviate\tfrom their path and hit the cathode ray tube \nat point A (Fig. 2.2). Similarly when only �magnetic\tfield\tis\tapplied,\telectron\tstrikes\tthe cathode ray tube at point C. By carefully �balancing\tthe\telectrical\tand\tmagnetic\tfield\tstrength, it is possible to bring back the \nelectron to the path which is followed in the �absence\tof\telectric\tor\tmagnetic\tfield\tand\tthey\thit the screen at point B. Thomson argued \nthat the amount of deviation of the particles \nfrom their path in the presence of electrical or\tmagnetic\tfield\tdepends\tupon:(i) the magnitude of the negative charge on the particle, greater the magnitude of \nthe charge on the particle, greater is the \ninteraction with the electric or magnetic field\tand\tthus\tgreater\tis\tthe\tdeflection.(ii) the mass of the particle — lighter the particle,\tgreater\tthe\tdeflection.(iii) the strength of the electrical or magnetic field\t—\tthe\tdeflection\tof\telectrons\tfrom\tits\toriginal path increases with the increase in the voltage across the electrodes, or �the\tstrength\tof\tthe\tmagnetic\tfield.By carrying out accurate measurements on\tthe\tamount\tof\tdeflections\tobserved\tby\tthe\telectrons\ton\tthe\telectric\tfield\tstrength\tor\tmagnetic\tfield\tstrength,\tThomson\twas\table\tto\tdetermine the value of e/me as: = 1.758820 × 1011 C kg–1                  (2.1)Where me is the mass of the electron in kg and e is the magnitude of the charge on the electron in coulomb (C). Since electrons are negatively charged, the charge on electron \nis –e.2.1.3 Charge on the ElectronR.A. Millikan (1868-1953) devised a method known as oil drop experiment (1906-14), to determine the charge on the electrons. \nHe found the charge on the electron to be  – 1.6 × 10–19 C. The present accepted value of electrical charge is – 1.602176 × 10–19 C. The mass of the  electron (me) was determined by combining these results with Thomson’s value \nof e/me ratio.= 9.1094×10–31 kg                             (2.2)Fig. 2.2 The apparatus to determine the charge to the mass ratio of electronUnit 2.indd   319/9/2022   4:28:08 PM322.1.4 Discovery of Protons and NeutronsElectrical\tdischarge\tcarried\tout\tin\tthe\tmodified\tcathode ray tube led to the discovery of canal rays carrying positively charged particles. The \ncharacteristics of these positively charged particles are listed below.(i) Unlike cathode rays, mass of positively charged particles depends upon the \nnature of gas present in the cathode \nray tube. These are simply the positively charged gaseous ions. (ii) The charge to mass ratio of the particles depends on the gas from which these \noriginate.(iii) Some of the positively charged particles \ncarry a multiple of the fundamental unit \nof electrical charge.(iv) The behaviour of these particles in the �magnetic\tor\telectrical\tfield\tis\topposite\tto that observed for electron or cathode \nrays.The smallest and lightest positive ion was obtained from hydrogen and was called \nproton. This positively charged particle was  characterised in 1919. Later, a need was felt \nfor the presence of electrically neutral particle \nas one of the constituent of atom. These \nparticles were discovered by Chadwick (1932) \nby bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium \nby α-particles. When electrically neutral particles having a mass slightly greater than \nthat of protons were emitted. He named \nthese particles as neutrons. The important properties of all these fundamental particles \nare given in Table 2.1.2.2 ATOMIC MODELSObservations obtained from the experiments mentioned in the previous sections have suggested\tthat\tDalton’s\tindivisible\tatom\tis\tcomposed of sub-atomic particles carrying positive and negative charges. The major problems before the scientists after the \ndiscovery of sub-atomic particles were:•\tto account for the stability of atom,•\tto compare the behaviour of elements in terms of both physical and chemical \nproperties,Millikan’s Oil Drop MethodIn this method, oil droplets in the form of mist, produced by the atomiser, were allowed \nto enter through a tiny hole in the upper \nplate of electrical condenser. The downward \nmotion of these droplets was viewed through \nthe telescope, equipped with a micrometer \neye piece. By measuring the rate of fall of \nthese droplets, Millikan was able to measure \nthe mass of oil droplets. The air inside the \nchamber was ionized by passing a beam of  \nX-rays through it. The electrical charge on \nthese oil droplets was acquired by collisions \nwith gaseous ions. The fall of these charged \noil droplets can be retarded, accelerated or \nmade stationary depending upon the charge \non the droplets and the polarity and strength \nof the voltage applied to the plate. By \ncarefully measuring the effects of electrical �field\tstrength\ton\tthe\tmotion\tof\toil\tdroplets,\tMillikan concluded that the magnitude of \nelectrical charge, q, on the droplets is always an integral multiple of the electrical charge, \ne, that is, q = n e, where n = 1, 2, 3... .•\tto explain the formation of different kinds of molecules by the combination of \ndifferent atoms and, •\tto understand the origin and nature of \nthe characteristics of electromagnetic \nradiation absorbed or emitted by atoms.Fig. 2.3 The Millikan oil drop apparatus for \nmeasuring charge ‘e’. In chamber, \nthe forces acting on oil drop are: gravitational, electrostatic due to �electrical field and a viscous drag \nforce when the oil drop is moving.Unit 2.indd   329/9/2022   4:28:08 PM33Different\tatomic\tmodels\twere\tproposed\tto explain the distributions of these charged particles in an atom. Although some of these \nmodels were not able to explain the stability \nof atoms, two of these models, one proposed by\tJ.J.\tThomson\tand\tthe\tother\tproposed\tby\tErnest Rutherford are discussed below.2.2.1 Thomson Model of AtomJ.\tJ.\tThomson,\tin\t1898,\tproposed\tthat\tan\tatom possesses a spherical shape (radius approximately 10–10 m) in which the positive charge is uniformly distributed. The electrons are embedded into it in such a manner as to \ngive the most stable electrostatic arrangement \n(Fig. 2.4). Many different names are given \nto this model, for example, plum pudding, \nraisin pudding or watermelon. This model In the later half of the nineteenth century different kinds of rays were discovered, \nbesides those mentioned earlier. Wilhalm \nRöentgen (1845-1923) in 1895 showed \nthat when electrons strike a material in \nthe cathode ray tubes, produce rays which �can\tcause\tfluorescence\tin\tthe\tfluorescent\tmaterials placed outside the cathode ray \ntubes. Since Röentgen did not know the \nnature of the radiation, he named them \nX-rays and the name is still carried on. It was \nnoticed that X-rays are produced effectively \nwhen electrons strike the dense metal anode, called\ttargets.\tThese\tare\tnot\tdeflected\tby\tthe\telectric\tand\tmagnetic\tfields\tand\thave\ta\tvery\thigh penetrating power through the matter \nand that is the reason that these rays are used to study the interior of the objects. \nThese rays are of very short wavelengths \n(∼0.1 nm) and possess electro-magnetic character (Section 2.3.1).Henri Becqueral (1852-1908) observed that there are certain elements which emit \nradiation on their own and named this \nphenomenon as  radioactivity and the elements known as radioactive elements. �This\tfield\twas\tdeveloped\tby\tMarie\tCurie,\tPiere Curie, Rutherford and Fredrick Soddy. \nIt was observed that three kinds of rays i.e., �α, β- and γ-rays are emitted. Rutherford found that α-rays consists of high energy particles carrying two units of positive charge \nand four unit of atomic mass. He concluded \nthat α- particles are helium nuclei as when α- particles combined with two electrons yielded \nhelium gas. β-rays are negatively chargedFig.2.4 Thomson model of atomcan be visualised as a pudding or watermelon of positive charge with plums or seeds \n(electrons) embedded into it. An important \nfeature of this model is that the mass of the \natom is assumed to be uniformly distributed \nover the atom. Although this model was able \nto explain the overall neutrality of the atom, \nbut was not consistent with the results of later \nexperiments. Thomson was awarded Nobel \nPrize for physics in 1906, for his theoretical \nand experimental investigations on the \nconduction of electricity by gases.Table 2.1  Properties of Fundamental Particles NameSymbolAbsolute charge/CRelative chargeMass/kgMass/uApprox. mass/uElectronProton\nNeutronepn– 1.602176×10–19+ 1.602176×10–190–1+109.109382×10–311.6726216×10–271.674927×10–270.00054\n1.00727\n1.008670\n1\n1Unit 2.indd   339/9/2022   4:28:08 PM34represented in Fig. 2.5. A stream of high energy α–particles from a radioactive source was directed at a thin foil (thickness ∼ 100 nm) of gold metal. The thin gold foil had a circular �fluorescent\tzinc\tsulphide\tscreen\taround\tit.\tWhenever α–particles struck the screen, a tiny\tflash\tof\tlight\twas\tproduced\tat\tthat\tpoint.The results of scattering experiment were quite unexpected. According to Thomson model of atom, the mass of each gold atom in the foil should have been spread evenly \nover the entire atom, and α–particles had enough energy to pass directly through such a \nuniform distribution of mass. It was expected \nthat the particles would slow down and \nchange directions only by a small angles as \nthey passed through the foil. It was observed \nthat:(i) most of the α–particles passed through �the\tgold\tfoil\tundeflected.(ii) a small fraction of the α–particles was �deflected\tby\tsmall\tangles.(iii) a very few α–particles (∼1 in 20,000) bounced\tback,\tthat\tis,\twere\tdeflected\tby\tnearly 180°. On the basis of the observations, Rutherford drew the following conclusions \nregarding the structure of atom:(i) Most of the space in the atom is empty as most of the α–particles passed through the\tfoil\tundeflected.(ii) A few positively charged α–particles were deflected.\tThe\tdeflection\tmust\tbe\tdue\tto enormous repulsive force showing \nthat the positive charge of the atom \nis not spread throughout the atom as Thomson had presumed. The positive \ncharge has to be concentrated in a very �small\tvolume\tthat\trepelled\tand\tdeflected\tthe positively charged α–particles. (iii) Calculations by Rutherford showed that \nthe volume occupied by the nucleus is negligibly small as compared to the \ntotal volume of the atom. The radius of \nthe atom is about 10–10 m, while that of nucleus is 10–15 m. One can appreciate this difference in size by realising that if Fig. 2.5 Schematic view of Rutherford’s scattering experiment. When a beam of alpha () particles is “shot” at a thin \ngold foil, most of them pass through \nwithout much effect. Some, however, �are deflected.A. Rutherford’s scattering experimentB. Schematic molecular view of the gold foil2.2.2 Rutherford’s Nuclear Model of AtomRutherford and his students (Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden) bombarded very thin \ngold foil with α–particles. Rutherford’s famous  –particle scattering experiment is particles similar to electrons. The γ-rays are high energy radiations like X-rays, are neutral in nature and do not consist of \nparticles. As regards penetrating power, �α-particles are the least, followed by β-rays \n(100 times that of α–particles) and γ-rays (1000 times of that α-particles).Unit 2.indd   349/9/2022   4:28:08 PM35a cricket ball represents a nucleus, then the radius of atom would be about 5 km.On the basis of above observations and conclusions, Rutherford proposed the nuclear model of atom. According to this model:(i) The positive charge and most of the mass of the atom was densely concentrated in \nextremely small region. This very small \nportion of the atom was called nucleus by Rutherford. (ii)  The nucleus is surrounded by electrons \nthat move around the nucleus with a \nvery high speed in circular paths called \norbits. Thus, Rutherford’s model of atom resembles the solar system in which the \nnucleus plays the role of sun and the \nelectrons that of revolving planets.(iii)  Electrons and the nucleus are held together by electrostatic forces of attraction.2.2.3 Atomic Number and Mass NumberThe presence of positive charge on the nucleus is due to the protons in the nucleus. As established earlier, the charge on the proton \nis equal but opposite to that of electron. The \nnumber of protons present in the nucleus is \nequal to atomic number (Z ). For example, the number of protons in the hydrogen nucleus \nis 1, in sodium atom it is 11, therefore their \natomic numbers are 1 and 11 respectively. \nIn order to keep the electrical neutrality,  \nthe number of electrons in an atom is equal \nto the number of protons (atomic number, \nZ ). For example, number of electrons in hydrogen atom and sodium atom are 1 and \n11 respectively.Atomic number (Z) = number of protons in              the nucleus of an atom      =  number of electrons          in a nuetral atom   (2.3)While the positive charge of the nucleus is due to protons, the mass of the nucleus,  due to protons and neutrons. As discussed earlier protons and neutrons present in the \nnucleus are collectively known as nucleons. The total number of nucleons is termed as mass number (A) of the atom. mass number (A) = number of protons (Z)                         + number of           neutrons (n)           (2.4)2.2.4 Isobars and IsotopesThe composition of any atom can be represented by using the normal element \nsymbol (X) with super-script on the left hand \nside as the atomic mass number (A) and \nsubscript (Z) on the left hand side as the atomic number (i.e., AZ X).Isobars are the atoms with same mass number but different atomic number for example, 614C and 714N. On the other hand, atoms with identical atomic number but \ndifferent atomic mass number are known \nas Isotopes. In other words (according to equation 2.4), it is evident that difference \nbetween the isotopes is due to the presence \nof different number of neutrons present in \nthe nucleus. For example, considering of \nhydrogen atom again, 99.985% of hydrogen \natoms contain only one proton. This isotope is \ncalled protium (11H). Rest of the percentage of hydrogen atom contains two other isotopes, \nthe one containing 1 proton and 1 neutron \nis called deuterium (12D, 0.015%) and the other one possessing 1 proton and 2 neutrons \nis called tritium (13T ). The latter isotope is found in trace amounts on the earth. Other \nexamples of commonly occuring isotopes are: \ncarbon atoms containing 6, 7 and 8 neutrons \nbesides 6 protons (612613614C,C,C); chlorine atoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons besides \n17 protons (17351737Cl,Cl).Lastly an important point to mention regarding isotopes is that chemical properties of atoms are controlled by the number of \nelectrons, which are determined by the number \nof protons in the nucleus. Number of neutrons \npresent in the nucleus have very little effect \non the chemical properties of an element. \nTherefore, all the isotopes of a given element \nshow same chemical behaviour.Unit 2.indd   359/9/2022   4:28:09 PM36Problem 2.1 Calculate the number of protons, neutrons and electrons in 8035Br.SolutionIn this case, 8035Br, Z = 35, A = 80, species is neutralNumber of protons = number of electrons = Z = 35Number of neutrons = 80 – 35 = 45, (equation 2.4)Problem 2.2 The number of electrons, protons and neutrons in a species are equal to 18, 16 \nand 16 respectively. Assign the proper \nsymbol to the species.SolutionThe atomic number is equal to  number of protons = 16. The element is \nsulphur (S).Atomic mass number = number of protons + number of neutrons= 16 + 16 = 32\nSpecies is not neutral as the number of protons is not equal to electrons. It is \nanion (negatively charged) with charge \nequal to excess electrons = 18 – 16 = 2. \nSymbol is .Note : Before using the notation AZ X, find\tout\twhether\tthe\tspecies\tis\ta\tneutral\tatom, a cation or an anion. If it is a \nneutral atom, equation (2.3) is valid, i.e., \nnumber of protons = number of electrons = atomic number. If the species is an \nion, determine whether the number of \nprotons are larger (cation, positive ion) \nor smaller (anion, negative ion) than the \nnumber of electrons. Number of neutrons \nis always given by A–Z, whether the \nspecies is neutral or ion.2.2.5 Drawbacks of Rutherford ModelAs you have learnt above, Rutherford nuclear model of an atom is like a small scale solar \nsystem with the nucleus playing the role * Classical mechanics is a theoretical science based on Newton’s laws of motion. It specifies the laws of motion of macroscopic \nobjects.of the massive sun and the electrons being similar to the lighter planets. When classical \nmechanics* is applied to the solar system, it �shows\tthat\tthe\tplanets\tdescribe\twell-defined\torbits around the sun. The gravitational force between the planets is given by the expression G.122mmr\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a where m1 and m2 are the masses, r is the distance of separation of the masses and G is the gravitational constant. The theory \ncan also calculate precisely the planetary \norbits and these are in agreement with the \nexperimental measurements.The similarity between the solar system and nuclear model suggests that electrons \nshould move around the nucleus in well �defined\torbits.\tFurther,\tthe\tcoulomb\tforce\t(kq1q2/r2 where q1 and q2 are the charges, r is the distance of separation of the charges \nand k is the proportionality constant) between \nelectron and the nucleus is mathematically \nsimilar to the gravitational force. However, \nwhen a body is moving in an orbit, it \nundergoes acceleration even if it is moving \nwith a constant speed in an orbit because \nof changing direction. So an electron in the \nnuclear model describing planet like orbits \nis under acceleration. According to the \nelectromagnetic theory of Maxwell, charged \nparticles when accelerated should emit \nelectromagnetic radiation (This feature does \nnot exist for planets since they are uncharged). \nTherefore, an electron in an orbit will emit \nradiation, the energy carried by radiation comes from electronic motion. The orbit will \nthus continue to shrink. Calculations show \nthat it should take an electron only 10–8 s to spiral into the nucleus. But this does \nnot happen. Thus, the Rutherford model  cannot explain the stability of an atom.  If the motion of an electron is described on \nthe basis of the classical mechanics and \nelectromagnetic theory, you may ask that  since the motion of electrons in orbits is  leading to the instability of the atom, then  why not consider electrons as stationary Unit 2.indd   369/9/2022   4:28:09 PM37around the nucleus. If the electrons were  stationary, electrostatic attraction between  the dense nucleus and the electrons would pull the electrons toward the nucleus to \nform a miniature version of Thomson’s model \nof atom.Another serious drawback of the Rutherford model is that it says nothing \nabout  distribution of the electrons around the \nnucleus and the energies of these electrons.2.3 DEVELOPMENTS LEADING TO THE BOHR’S MODEL OF ATOMHistorically, results observed from the studies of interactions of radiations with matter have provided immense information regarding \nthe structure of atoms and molecules. Neils \nBohr utilised these results to improve upon \nthe model proposed by Rutherford. Two \ndevelopments played a major role in the \nformulation of Bohr’s model of atom. These \nwere:(i)\tDual\tcharacter\tof\tthe\telectromagnetic\tradiation which means that radiations possess both wave like and particle like \nproperties, and(ii) Experimental results regarding atomic \nspectra.First, we will discuss about the duel nature of electromagnetic radiations. Experimental \nresults regarding atomic spectra will be \ndiscussed in Section 2.4.2.3.1 Wave Nature of Electromagnetic   RadiationIn the mid-nineteenth century, physicists actively studied absorption and emission of radiation by heated objects. These are called �thermal\tradiations.\tThey\ttried\tto\tfind\tout\tof\twhat the thermal radiation is made. It is now \na well-known fact that thermal radiations consist of electromagnetic waves of various \nfrequencies or wavelengths. It is based on \na number of modern concepts, which were \nunknown in the mid-nineteenth century. \nFirst active study of thermal radiation laws \noccured in the 1850’s and the theory of \nelectromagnetic waves and the emission of \nsuch waves by accelerating charged particles was\tdeveloped\tin\tthe\tearly\t1870’s\tby\tJames\tClerk Maxwell, which was experimentally confirmed\tlater\tby\tHeinrich\tHertz.\tHere,\twe\twill learn some facts about electromagnetic \nradiations.James\tMaxwell\t(1870)\twas\tthe\tfirst\tto\tgive a comprehensive explanation about the interaction between the charged bodies and \nthe behaviour of electrical and magnetic fields\ton\tmacroscopic\tlevel.\tHe\tsuggested\tthat when electrically charged particle moves \nunder accelaration, alternating electrical and �magnetic\tfields\tare\tproduced\tand\ttransmitted.\tThese\tfields\tare\ttransmitted\tin\tthe\tforms\tof waves called electromagnetic waves or \nelectromagnetic radiation.Light is the form of radiation known from early days and speculation about its nature dates back to remote ancient times. In earlier \ndays (Newton) light was supposed to be made \nof particles (corpuscules). It was only in the \n19th century when wave nature of light was \nestablished.Maxwell\twas\tagain\tthe\tfirst\tto\treveal\tthat\tlight waves are associated with oscillating electric and magnetic character (Fig. 2.6). Although electromagnetic wave motion is complex in nature, we will consider here only \na few simple properties.\n(i)  The oscillating electric and magnetic �fields\tproduced\tby\toscillating\tcharged\tFig.2.6  The electric and magnetic field components of an electromagnetic \nwave. These components have the \nsame wavelength, frequency, speed \nand amplitude, but  they vibrate in two \nmutually perpendicular planes.Unit 2.indd   379/9/2022   4:28:10 PM38particles are perpendicular to each other and both are perpendicular to the \ndirection of propagation of the wave. �Simplified\tpicture\tof\telectromagnetic\twave is shown in Fig. 2.6.(ii)  Unlike sound waves or waves produced  \nin water, electromagnetic waves do \nnot require medium and can move in vacuum. (iii)  It is now well established that there \nare many types of electromagnetic radiations, which differ from one \nanother in wavelength (or frequency). \nThese constitute what is called \nelectromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 2.7). �Different\tregions\tof\tthe\tspectrum\tare\tidentified by different names. Some examples are: radio frequency region \naround 106 Hz, used for broadcasting; microwave region around 1010 Hz used for radar; infrared region around 1013 Hz used for heating; ultraviolet region \naround 1016Hz a component of sun’s radiation. The small portion around 1015 Hz, is what is ordinarily called visible \nlight. It is only this part which our eyes \ncan see (or detect). Special instruments \nare required to detect non-visible \nradiation.(iv)\t\tDifferent\tkinds\tof\tunits\tare\tused\tto\trepresent electromagnetic radiation.These radiations are characterised by the properties, namely, frequency (ν) and wavelength (λ).The SI unit for frequency (ν) is hertz  (Hz, s–1),\tafter\tHeinrich\tHertz.\tIt\tis\tdefined\tas\tthe number of waves that pass a given point in one second.Wavelength should have the units of length and as you know that the SI units of \nlength is meter (m). Since electromagnetic \nradiation consists of different kinds of waves \nof much smaller wavelengths, smaller units \nare used. Fig. 2.7 shows various types of \nelectro-magnetic radiations which differ from \none another in wavelengths and frequencies.In vaccum all types of electromagnetic radiations, regardless of wavelength, travel at the same speed, i.e., 3.0 × 108 m s–1 (2.997925 × 108 ms–1, to be precise). This is called speed of light and is given the symbol ‘c’. The \nfrequency (ν ), wavelength (λ) and velocity of light (c) are related by the equation (2.5). c = ν  λ            (2.5)Fig. 2.7 (a) The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. (b) Visible spectrum. The visible region is only a small part of the entire spectrum.(a)(b)Unit 2.indd   389/9/2022   4:28:10 PM39The other commonly used quantity specially in spectroscopy, is the wavenumber (). It is defined as the number of wavelengths per unit length. Its units are reciprocal of wavelength unit, i.e., m–1. However commonly used unit is cm–1 (not SI unit).Problem 2.3The Vividh Bharati station of All India Radio,\tDelhi,\tbroadcasts\ton\ta\tfrequency\tof 1,368 kHz (kilo hertz). Calculate \nthe wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by transmitter. Which \npart of the electromagnetic spectrum \ndoes it belong to?SolutionThe wavelength, λ, is equal to c/ν, where \nc is the speed of electromagnetic radiation in vacuum and ν is the frequency. Substituting the given values, we have\u001f\u001ecv This is a characteristic radiowave \nwavelength.Problem 2.4The wavelength range of the visible spectrum extends from violet (400 nm) to \nred (750 nm). Express these wavelengths \nin frequencies (Hz).

However, following \nare some of the observations which could \nnot be explained with the help of even the \nelectromagentic theory of 19th century \nphysics (known as classical physics): (i) the nature of emission of radiation from hot bodies (black-body radiation)(ii) ejection of electrons from metal surface \nwhen radiation strikes it (photoelectric effect)(iii) variation of heat capacity of solids as a \nfunction of temperatureUnit 2.indd   399/9/2022   4:28:10 PM40entering\tthe\thole\twill\tbe\treflected\tby\tthe\tcavity\twalls and will be eventually absorbed by the walls. A black body is also a perfect radiator of radiant energy. Furthermore, a black body is \nin thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. \nIt radiates same amount of energy per unit \narea as it absorbs from its surrounding in \nany given time. The amount of light emitted \n(intensity of radiation) from a black body \nand its spectral distribution depends only \non its temperature. At a given temperature, \nintensity of radiation emitted increases \nwith the increase of wavelength, reaches a \nmaximum value at a given wavelength and \nthen starts decreasing with further increase of \nwavelength, as shown in Fig. 2.8. Also, as the \ntemperature increases, maxima of the curve \nshifts to short wavelength. Several attempts \nwere made to predict the intensity of radiation as a function of wavelength.But the results of the above experiment could not be explained satisfactorily on the basis of the wave theory of light. Max \nPlanck arrived at a satisfactory relationship  Fig. 2.8(a) Black body Fig. 2.8 Wavelength-intensity relationship(iv) Line spectra of atoms with special \nreference to hydrogen.These phenomena indicate that the system can take energy only in discrete amounts. All possible energies cannot be taken up or radiated. It\tis\tnoteworthy\tthat\tthe\tfirst\tconcrete\texplanation for the phenomenon of the black body radiation mentioned above was given �by\tMax\tPlanck\tin\t1900.\tLet\tus\tfirst\ttry\tto\tunderstand this phenomenon, which is  given below:Hot objects emit electromagnetic radiations over a wide range of wavelengths. \nAt high temperatures, an appreciable \nproportion of radiation is in the visible \nregion of the spectrum. As the temperature \nis raised, a higher proportion of short \nwavelength (blue light) is generated. For \nexample, when an iron rod is heated in a �furnace,\tit\tfirst\tturns\tto\tdull\tred\tand\tthen\tprogressively becomes more and more red as the temperature increases. As this is \nheated further, the radiation emitted becomes  white and then becomes blue as the \ntemperature becomes very high. This means \nthat red radiation is most intense at a \nparticular temperature and the blue radiation \nis more intense at another temperature. This \nmeans intensities of radiations of different \nwavelengths emitted by hot body depend \nupon its temperature. By late 1850’s it was \nknown that objects made of different material \nand kept at different temperatures emit \ndifferent amount of radiation. Also, when the \nsurface of an object is irradiated with light \n(electromagnetic radiation), a part of radiant �energy\tis\tgenerally\treflected\tas\tsuch,\ta\tpart\tis absorbed and a part of it is transmitted. \nThe reason for incomplete absorption is \nthat ordinary objects are as a rule imperfect \nabsorbers of radiation. An ideal body, which \nemits and absorbs radiations of all frequencies uniformly, is called a black body and the \nradiation emitted by such a body is called \nblack body radiation. In practice, no such \nbody exists. Carbon black approximates \nfairly closely to black body. A good physical  \napproximation to a black body is a cavity with a \ntiny hole, which has no other opening. Any ray Unit 2.indd   409/9/2022   4:28:10 PM41by making an assumption that absorption and emmission of radiation arises from \noscillator i.e., atoms in the wall of black \nbody. Their frequency of oscillation is \nchanged by interaction with oscilators of \nelectromagnetic radiation. Planck assumed \nthat radiation could be sub-divided into \ndiscrete chunks of energy. He suggested that \natoms and molecules could emit or absorb \nenergy only in discrete quantities and not \nin a continuous manner. He gave the name \nquantum to the smallest quantity of energy that can be emitted or absorbed in the form \nof electromagnetic radiation. The energy (E) \nof a quantum of radiation is proportional  to its frequency (ν) and is expressed by equation (2.6).      E = hυ                                              (2.6)The proportionality constant, ‘h’ is known as Planck’s constant and has the value 6.626×10–34 J\ts.\tWith this theory, Planck was able to explain the distribution of intensity in the radiation from black body as a function of frequency or \nwavelength at different temperatures. Quantisation has been compared to standing on a staircase. A person can stand on any step of a staircase, but it is not possible \nfor him/her to stand in between the two steps. \nThe energy can take any one of the values \nfrom the following set, but cannot take on any values between them.E = 0, hυ, 2hυ , 3hυ....nhυ..... Photoelectric EffectIn 1887, H. Hertz performed a very interesting experiment in which electrons (or electric \ncurrent) were ejected when certain metals \n(for example potassium, rubidium, caesium \netc.) were exposed to a beam of light as shown  in Fig. 2.9. The phenomenon is called Photoelectric effect. The results observed in this experiment were: (i) The electrons are ejected from the metal surface as soon as the beam of light \nstrikes the surface, i.e., there is no time \nlag between the striking of light beam and \nthe ejection of electrons from the metal \nsurface.(ii) The number of electrons ejected is \nproportional to the intensity or brightness \nof light. (iii) For each metal, there is a characteristic \nminimum frequency, ν0 (also known as threshold frequency) below which photoelectric effect is not observed. At \na frequency ν \u003eν0, the ejected electrons come out with certain kinetic energy. \nThe kinetic energies of these electrons \nincrease with the increase of frequency \nof the light used.All the above results could not be explained on the basis of laws of classical physics. \nAccording to latter, the energy content of the \nbeam of light depends upon the brightness of \nthe light. In other words, number of electrons \nejected and kinetic energy associated with \nthem should depend on the brightness of light. \nIt has been observed that though the number Fig.2.9  Equipment for studying the photoelectric effect. Light of a particular frequency strikes a clean metal surface inside a \nvacuum chamber. Electrons are ejected \nfrom the metal and are counted by a \ndetector that measures their kinetic \nenergy.Max Planck(1858–1947)Max Planck, a German physicist, \nreceived his Ph.D in theoretical \nphysics from the University of \nMunich in 1879. In 1888, he \nwas appointed Director of the \nInstitute of Theoretical Physics \nat the University of Berlin. Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \nin 1918 for his quantum theory. Planck also made �significant contributions in thermodynamics and \nother areas of physics.Unit 2.indd   419/9/2022   4:28:11 PM42of electrons ejected does depend upon the brightness of light, the kinetic energy of the \nejected electrons does not. For example, red \nlight [ν = (4.3 to 4.6) × 1014 Hz] of any brightness (intensity) may shine on a piece of potassium \nmetal for hours but no photoelectrons are \nejected. But, as soon as even a very weak \nyellow light (ν = 5.1–5.2 × 1014 Hz) shines on the potassium metal, the photoelectric effect \nis observed. The threshold frequency (ν0) for potassium metal is 5.0×1014 Hz. Einstein (1905) was able to explain the photoelectric effect using Planck’s quantum \ntheory of electromagnetic radiation as a \nstarting point. the minimum energy required to eject the electron is hν0 (also called work function, W0; Table 2.2), then the difference in energy  (hν – hν0 ) is transferred as the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. Following the conservation \nof energy principle, the kinetic energy of the \nejected electron is given by the equation 2.7.  (2.7)where me is the mass of the electron and v is the velocity associated with the ejected electron. \nLastly, a more intense beam of light consists \nof larger number of photons, consequently the \nnumber of electrons ejected is also larger as \ncompared to that in an experiment in which a \nbeam of weaker intensity of light is employed. Dual Behaviour of Electromagnetic RadiationThe particle nature of light posed a dilemma for scientists. On the one hand, it could explain \nthe black body radiation and  photoelectric \neffect satisfactorily but on the other hand, \nit was not consistent with the known wave \nbehaviour of light which could account for the \nphenomena of interference and diffraction. \nThe only way to resolve the dilemma was \nto accept the idea that light possesses \nboth particle and wave-like properties, i.e., �light\thas\tdual\tbehaviour.\tDepending\ton\tthe\texperiment,\twe\tfind\tthat\tlight\tbehaves\teither as a wave or as a stream of particles. Whenever radiation interacts with matter, it displays particle like properties in contrast \nto the wavelike properties (interference \nand diffraction), which it exhibits when it \npropagates. This concept was totally alien to \nthe way the scientists thought about matter \nand radiation and it took them a long time to \nbecome convinced of its validity. It turns out, \nas you shall see later, that some microscopic particles like electrons also exhibit this wave-\nparticle duality.Shining a beam of light on to a metal surface can, therefore, be viewed as shooting a beam of particles, the photons. When a �photon\tof\tsufficient\tenergy\tstrikes\tan\telectron\tin the atom of the metal, it transfers its energy instantaneously to the electron during the \ncollision and the electron is ejected without \nany time lag or delay. Greater the energy \npossessed by the photon, greater will be \ntransfer of energy to the electron and greater \nthe kinetic energy of the ejected electron. In \nother words, kinetic energy of the ejected \nelectron is proportional to the frequency \nof the electromagnetic radiation. Since the \nstriking photon has energy equal to hν  and Table 2.2  Values of Work Function (W0) for a Few Metals MetalLiNaKMgCuAgW0 /eV2.422.32.253.74.84.3Albert Einstein, a German born American physicist, is regarded \nby many as one of the two great \nphysicists the world has known �(the other is Isaac Newton).

As a result, the beam of light is deviated or refracted \nfrom its original path as it passes from one \nmedium to another. It is observed that when \na ray of white light is passed through a prism, \nthe wave with shorter wavelength bends more \nthan the one with a longer wavelength. Since \nordinary white light consists of waves with \nall the wavelengths in the visible range, a ray \nof white light is spread out into a series of \ncoloured bands called spectrum. The light of \nred colour which has longest wavelength is \ndeviated the least while the violet light, which \nhas shortest wavelength is deviated the most. \nThe spectrum of white light, that we can \nsee, ranges from violet at 7.50 × 1014 Hz to red at 4×1014 Hz. Such a spectrum is called continuous spectrum. Continuous because \nviolet merges into blue, blue into green and \nso on. A similar spectrum is produced when \na rainbow forms in the sky. Remember that \nvisible light is just a small portion of the \nelectromagnetic radiation (Fig.2.7). When \nelectromagnetic radiation interacts with \nmatter, atoms and molecules may absorb \nenergy and reach to a higher energy state. With \nhigher energy, these are in an unstable state. \nFor returning to their normal (more stable, \nlower energy states) energy state, the atoms \nand molecules emit radiations in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.Emission and Absorption SpectraThe spectrum of radiation emitted by a \nsubstance that has absorbed energy is called \nan emission spectrum. Atoms, molecules or ions that have absorbed radiation are said \nto be “excited”. To produce an emission spectrum, energy is supplied to a sample by \nheating it or irradiating it and the wavelength \n(or frequency) of the radiation emitted, as \nthe sample gives up the absorbed energy, is \nrecorded.An absorption spectrum is like the photographic negative of an emission spectrum. A continuum of radiation is passed through a sample which absorbs radiation of \ncertain wavelengths. The missing wavelength \nwhich corresponds to the radiation absorbed \nby the matter, leave dark spaces in the bright \ncontinuous spectrum.The study of emission or absorption spectra is referred to as spectroscopy. The spectrum of the visible light, as discussed \nabove, was continuous as all wavelengths (red \nto violet) of the visible light are represented in \nthe spectra. The emission spectra of atoms in \nthe gas phase, on the other hand, do not show \na continuous spread of wavelength from red �to\tviolet,\trather\tthey\temit\tlight\tonly\tat\tspecific\twavelengths with dark spaces between them. \nSuch spectra are called line spectra or atomic spectra because the emitted radiation �is\tidentified\tby\tthe\tappearance\tof\tbright\tlines\tin the spectra (Fig. 2.10 page 45).Line emission spectra are of great interest in the study of electronic structure. \nEach element has a unique line emission \nspectrum. The characteristic lines in atomic \nspectra can be used in chemical analysis to \nidentify unknown atoms in the same way �as\tfingerprints\tare\tused\tto\tidentify\tpeople.\tThe exact matching of lines of the emission \nspectrum of the atoms of a known element \nwith the lines from an unknown sample quickly establishes the identity of the latter, \nGerman chemist, Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) �was\tone\tof\tthe\tfirst\tinvestigators\tto\tuse\tline\tspectra to identify elements.Elements like rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs) thallium (Tl), indium (In), gallium (Ga) and \nscandium (Sc) were discovered when their \nminerals were analysed by spectroscopic \nmethods. The element helium (He) was discovered in the sun by spectroscopic method.Line Spectrum of Hydrogen When an electric discharge is passed through gaseous hydrogen, the H2 molecules dissociate and the energetically excited hydrogen atoms \nproduced emit electromagnetic radiation of \ndiscrete frequencies. The hydrogen spectrum \nconsists of several series of lines named after \ntheir discoverers. Balmer showed in 1885 \non the basis of experimental observations * The restriction of any property to discrete values is called quantization.Unit 2.indd   449/9/2022   4:28:11 PM45that if spectral lines are expressed in terms of wavenumber (), then the visible lines of the hydrogen spectrum obey the following formula:         (2.8)where n is an integer equal to or greater than 3 (i.e., n = 3,4,5,....)The series of lines described by this formula are called the Balmer series. The Balmer series of lines are the only lines in the hydrogen spectrum which appear in the visible region \nof the electromagnetic spectrum. The Swedish �spectroscopist,\tJohannes\tRydberg,\tnoted\tthat all series of lines in the hydrogen \nspectrum could be described by the following expression :         (2.9)where n1=1,2........n2 = n1 + 1, n1 + 2......The value 109,677 cm–1 is called the Rydberg constant\tfor\thydrogen.\tThe\tfirst\tfive\tseries of lines that correspond to n1 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are known as Lyman, Balmer, Paschen, Bracket and Pfund series, respectively,  Table 2.3 shows these series of transitions in \nthe hydrogen spectrum. Fig. 2.11 (page, 46) \nshows the Lyman, Balmer and Paschen series \nof transitions for hydrogen atom.Of all the elements, hydrogen atom has the simplest line spectrum. Line spectrum (a)(b)Fig. 2.10 (a) Atomic emission.  The light emitted by a sample of excited hydrogen atoms (or any other element) can be passed through a prism and separated into certain discrete wavelengths. Thus an emission spectrum, which is a photographic recording of the separated wavelengths is called as line spectrum. Any \nsample of reasonable size contains an enormous number of atoms. Although a single atom can be in only \none excited state at a time, the collection of atoms contains all possible excited states. The light emitted as \nthese atoms fall to lower energy states is responsible for the spectrum. (b) Atomic absorption. When white \nlight is passed through unexcited atomic hydrogen and then through a slit and prism, the transmitted light �is lacking in intensity at the same wavelengths as are emitted in (a) The recorded absorption spectrum is \nalso a line spectrum and the photographic negative of the emission spectrum.Table 2.3 The Spectral Lines for Atomic HydrogenSeriesn1n2Spectral RegionLymanBalmer\nPaschen\nBrackett\nPfund1\n2\n3\n4\n52,3....\n3,4....\n4,5....\n5,6....\n6,7....Ultraviolet\nVisible\nInfrared\nInfrared\nInfraredUnit 2.indd   459/9/2022   4:28:12 PM46becomes more and more complex for heavier atom. There are, however, certain features \nwhich are common to all line spectra, i.e., \n(i) line spectrum of element is unique and \n(ii) there is regularity in the line spectrum of \neach element. The questions which arise are: \nWhat are the reasons for these similarities? \nIs it something to do with the electronic \nstructure of atoms?

He used Planck’s concept of quantisation \nof energy. Though the theory is not the \nmodern quantum mechanics, it can still \nbe used to rationalize many points in the Fig. 2.11 Transitions of the electron in the hydrogen atom (The diagram shows the \nLyman, Balmer and Paschen series of �transitions)atomic structure and spectra. Bohr’s model for hydrogen atom is based on the following postulates:i) The electron in the hydrogen atom can move around the nucleus in a circular path\tof\tfixed\tradius\tand\tenergy.\tThese\tpaths are called orbits, stationary states \nor allowed energy states. These orbits \nare arranged concentrically around the \nnucleus.ii) The energy of an electron in the orbit \ndoes not change with time. However, the electron will move from a lower \nstationary state to a higher stationary \nstate when required amount of energy \nis absorbed by the electron or energy is \nemitted when electron moves from higher \nstationary state to lower stationary state \n(equation 2.16). The energy change does \nnot take place in a continuous manner.Angular MomentumJust\tas\tlinear\tmomentum\tis\tthe\tproduct\tof mass (m) and linear velocity (v), angular momentum is the product of moment of \ninertia (I) and angular velocity (ω). For an electron of mass me, moving in a circular path of radius r around the nucleus,   angular momentum = I × ωSince I = mer2, and  ω = v/r where v is the linear velocity, ∴angular momentum =  mer2 × v/r = mevriii) The frequency of radiation absorbed or emitted when transition occurs between two stationary states that differ in energy by ∆E, is given by:                        (2.10) Where E1 and E2 are the energies of the lower and higher allowed energy states respectively. This expression is commonly known as Bohr’s frequency rule.iv) The angular momentum of an electron \nis quantised. In a given stationary state \nit can be expressed as in equation (2.11)   mrnhev\u001f.2\u001e  n = 1,2,3.....        (2.11)Unit 2.indd   469/9/2022   4:28:13 PM47Where me is the mass of electron, v is the velocity and r is the radius of the orbit in which electron is moving.Thus an electron can move only in those orbits for which its angular momentum is integral multiple of h/2π.  That means angular momentum is quantised. Radiation is emitted \nor obsorbed only when transition of electron \ntakes place from one quantised value of \nangular momentum to another. Therefore, \nMaxwell’s electromagnetic theory does not �apply\there\tthat\tis\twhy\tonly\tcertain\tfixed\torbits\tare allowed.The details regarding the derivation of energies of the stationary states used by Bohr, are quite complicated and will be discussed in \nhigher classes. However, according to Bohr’s \ntheory for hydrogen atom:\na) The stationary states for electron are \nnumbered n = 1,2,3.......... These integral numbers (Section 2.6.2) are known as \nPrincipal quantum numbers.b) The radii of the stationary states are expressed as:  rn  = n2 a0                                      (2.12) where a0 = 52.9 pm. Thus the radius of the\tfirst\tstationary\tstate,\tcalled\tthe\tBohr orbit, is 52.9 pm. Normally the electron \nin the hydrogen atom is found in this \norbit (that is n=1). As n increases the value of r will increase. In other words \nthe electron will be present away from \nthe nucleus.c) The most important property associated \nwith the electron, is the energy of its \nstationary state. It is given by the expression.EnnH\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018R12     n = 1,2,3....          (2.13)where RH is called Rydberg constant and its value is 2.18×10–18\tJ.\tThe\tenergy\tof\tthe\tlowest state, also called as the ground state, is  E1 = –2.18×10–18 (112) = –2.18×10–18 J.\tThe\tenergy of the stationary state for n = 2, willbe : E2 = –2.18×10–18J\t(122) = –0.545×10–18 J.\tFig. 2.11 depicts the energies of different stationary states or energy levels of hydrogen \natom. This representation is called an energy \nlevel diagram.When\tthe\telectron\tis\tfree\tfrom\tthe\tinfluence\tof nucleus, the energy is taken as zero. The \nelectron in this situation is associated with the stationary state of Principal Quantum number \n= n = ∞ and is called as ionized hydrogen atom. When the electron is attracted by the nucleus and is present in orbit n, the energy is emitted and its energy is lowered. That is the reason What does the negative electronic energy (En) for hydrogen atom mean?The energy of the electron in a hydrogen atom has a negative sign for all possible orbits (eq. 2.13). What does this negative \nsign convey? This negative sign means \nthat the energy of the electron in the \natom is lower than the energy of a free \nelectron at rest. A free electron at rest �is\tan\telectron\tthat\tis\tinfinitely\tfar\taway\tfrom the nucleus and is assigned the \nenergy value of zero. Mathematically, this �corresponds\tto\tsetting\tn\tequal\tto\tinfinity\tin the equation (2.13) so that E∞=0. As the electron gets closer to the nucleus (as n \ndecreases), En becomes larger in absolute value and more and more negative. The \nmost negative energy value is given by \nn=1 which corresponds to the most stable orbit. We call this the ground state.Niels Bohr(1885–1962)Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist \nreceived his Ph.D. from the \nUniversity of Copenhagen in �1911. He then spent a year \nwith J.J. Thomson and Ernest \nRutherford in England. In 1913, he returned to Copenhagen where he remained for �the rest of his life. In 1920 he was named Director �of the Institute of theoretical Physics. After first \nWorld War, Bohr worked energetically for peaceful �uses of atomic energy. He received the first Atoms \nfor Peace award in 1957. Bohr was awarded the �Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922.Unit 2.indd   479/9/2022   4:28:13 PM48for the presence of negative sign in equation (2.13) and depicts its stability relative to the \nreference state of zero energy and n = ∞.d) Bohr’s theory can also be applied to the ions containing only one electron, similar to that present in hydrogen \natom. For example, He+ Li2+, Be3+ and so on. The energies of the stationary states \nassociated with these kinds of ions (also \nknown as hydrogen like species) are given by the expression.

From the above equations, it is \nevident that the value of energy becomes more \nnegative and that of radius becomes smaller \nwith increase of Z. This means that electron will be tightly bound to the nucleus.e) It is also possible to calculate the velocities of electrons moving in these orbits. Although the precise equation \nis not given here, qualitatively the \nmagnitude of velocity of electron \nincreases with increase of positive \ncharge on the nucleus and decreases \nwith increase of principal quantum number.2.4.1 Explanation of Line Spectrum of   HydrogenLine spectrum observed in case of hydrogen atom, as mentioned in section 2.3.3, can be explained quantitatively using Bohr’s model. \nAccording to assumption 2, radiation (energy) \nis absorbed if the electron moves from the \norbit of smaller Principal quantum number to \nthe orbit of higher Principal quantum number, \nwhereas the radiation (energy) is emitted if \nthe electron moves from higher orbit to lower \norbit. The energy gap between the two orbits is given by equation (2.16)∆E = Ef – Ei                                      (2.16)Combining equations (2.13) and (2.16)\u001fEnn\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001d\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017RRHfHi22 (where ni and nf stand\tfor\tinitial\torbit\tand\tfinal\torbits) ∆E\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001f\u0017\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001eRJHifif112181011221822nnnn.

However, Bohr’s model was too simple to account for the following points.i)\tIt\tfails\tto\taccount\tfor\tthe\tfiner\tdetails\t(doublet, that is two closely spaced lines) of the hydrogen atom spectrum observed \nby using sophisticated spectroscopic techniques. This model is also unable \nto explain the spectrum of atoms \nother than hydrogen, for example, \nhelium atom which possesses only two \nelectrons. Further, Bohr’s theory was \nalso unable to explain the splitting \nof spectral lines in the presence of \nmagnetic field (Zeeman effect) or an �electric\tfield\t(Stark\teffect).ii) It could not explain the ability of atoms \nto form molecules by chemical bonds.In other words, taking into account the points mentioned above, one needs a better \ntheory which can explain the salient features of the structure of complex atoms.2.5 TOWARDS QUANTUM MECHANICAL MODEL OF THE ATOMIn view of the shortcoming of the Bohr’s model, attempts were made to develop a more \nsuitable and general model for atoms. Two \nimportant developments which contributed �significantly\tin\tthe\tformulation\tof\tsuch\ta\tmodel were:1.\t\tDual\tbehaviour\tof\tmatter,\t2.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.2.5.1 Dual Behaviour of MatterThe French physicist, de Broglie, in 1924 proposed that matter, like radiation, should also exhibit dual behaviour i.e., both particle \nand wavelike properties. This means that \njust as the photon has momentum as well \nas wavelength, electrons should also have \nmomentum as well as wavelength, de Broglie, \nfrom this analogy, gave the following relation \nbetween wavelength (λ) and momentum (p) of \na material particle.Unit 2.indd   499/9/2022   4:28:15 PM50SolutionAccording to de Brogile equation (2.22)\u001f\u001e\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001chmvJskgms(.)(.)()6626100110341= 6.626 × 10–34 m\t(J\t=\tkg\tm2 s–2) Problem 2.13The mass of an electron is 9.1×10–31 kg.

This fact has been put to use in making \nan electron microscope, which is based on \nthe wavelike behaviour of electrons just as an \nordinary microscope utilises the wave nature \nof light. An electron microscope is a powerful �tool\tin\tmodern\tscientific\tresearch\tbecause\tit\tachieves\ta\tmagnification\tof\tabout\t15\tmillion\ttimes.It needs to be noted that according to de Broglie, every object in motion has a wave \ncharacter. The wavelengths associated with \nordinary objects are so short (because of their \nlarge masses) that their wave properties cannot be detected. The wavelengths associated with \nelectrons and other subatomic particles (with \nvery small mass) can however be detected \nexperimentally. Results obtained from \nthe following problems prove these points \nqualitatively.Problem 2.12What will be the wavelength of a ball of mass 0.1 kg moving with a velocity of \n10 m s–1 ?2.5.2 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle Werner Heisenberg a German physicist in 1927, stated uncertainty principle which is the consequence of dual behaviour of matter \nand radiation. It states that it is impossible to determine simultaneously, the exact \nposition and exact momentum (or velocity) of an electron.Mathematically, it can be given as in equation (2.23).Louis de Broglie \n(1892 – 1987) Louis de Broglie, a French physicist, studied history \nas an undergraduate in the �early 1910’s. His interest turned to science as a result \nof his assignment to radio \ncommunications in World �War I. He received his Dr. Sc. from the University of Paris in 1924. �He was professor of theoretical physics at �the University of Paris from 1932 untill his �retirement in 1962. He was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929.Unit 2.indd   509/9/2022   4:28:16 PM51                         (2.23)where ∆x is the uncertainty in position and ∆px (or ∆vx) is the uncertainty in momentum (or velocity) of the particle. If the position of the electron is known with high degree of \naccuracy (∆x is small), then the velocity of the \nelectron will be uncertain [∆(vx) is large]. On the other hand, if the velocity of the electron \nis known precisely (∆(vx ) is small), then the position of the electron will be uncertain  (∆x will be large). Thus, if we carry out some \nphysical measurements on the electron’s \nposition or velocity, the outcome will always \ndepict a fuzzy or blur picture.The uncertainty principle can be best understood with the help of an example. Suppose you are asked to measure the \nthickness of a sheet of paper with an \nunmarked metrestick. Obviously, the results \nobtained would be extremely inaccurate \nand meaningless. In order to obtain any \naccuracy, you should use an instrument \ngraduated in units smaller than the thickness \nof a sheet of the paper. Analogously, in order \nto determine the position of an electron, we \nmust use a meterstick calibrated in units of \nsmaller than the dimensions of electron (keep \nin mind that an electron is considered as a \npoint charge and is therefore, dimensionless). \nTo observe an electron, we can illuminate it \nwith “light” or electromagnetic radiation. The \n“light” used must have a wavelength smaller \nthan the dimensions of an electron. The high momentum photons of such light ph=\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019  would change the energy of electrons by collisions. In this process we, no doubt, \nwould be able to calculate the position of the \nelectron, but we would know very little about \nthe velocity of the electron after the collision.Significance of Uncertainty PrincipleOne of the important implications of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is that it �rules out existence of definite paths or \ntrajectories of electrons and other similar \nparticles. The trajectory of an object is \ndetermined by its location and velocity at \nvarious moments. If we know where a body \nis at a particular instant and if we also know \nits velocity and the forces acting on it at that \ninstant, we can tell where the body would \nbe sometime later. We, therefore, conclude \nthat the position of an object and its velocity \nfix its trajectory. Since for a sub-atomic \nobject such as an electron, it is not possible \nsimultaneously to determine the position and \nvelocity at any given instant to an arbitrary \ndegree of precision, it is not possible to talk \nof the trajectory of an electron.The effect of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is significant only for motion of \nmicroscopic objects and is negligible for \nthat of macroscopic objects. This can be \nseen from the following examples.If uncertainty principle is applied to an object of mass, say about a milligram (10–6 kg), then Werner Heisenberg (1901 – 1976) Werner Heisenberg (1901 – 1976) received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Munich in 1923. He then spent a year working with Max Born at Gottingen and three years with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. He was professor of �physics at the University of Leipzig from 1927 to 1941. During World War II, Heisenberg \nwas in charge of German research on the atomic bomb. After the war he was named �director of Max Planck Institute for physics in Gottingen. He was also accomplished �mountain climber. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932.Unit 2.indd   519/9/2022   4:28:16 PM52The value of ∆v∆x obtained is extremely small\tand\tis\tinsignificant.\tTherefore,\tone\tmay say that in dealing with milligram-sized or heavier objects, the associated uncertainties are hardly of any real \nconsequence.In the case of a microscopic object like an electron on the other hand. ∆v.∆x obtained is much larger and such uncertainties are of real \nconsequence. For example, for an electron \nwhose mass is 9.11×10–31 kg., according to Heisenberg uncertainty principleIt, therefore, means that if one tries to find\tthe\texact\tlocation\tof\tthe\telectron,\tsay\tto an uncertainty of only 10–8 m, then the uncertainty ∆v in velocity would be 101010421841\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001f\u001emsmms which is so large that the classical picture of\telectrons\tmoving\tin\tBohr’s\torbits\t(fixed)\tcannot hold good. It, therefore, means that the precise statements of the position \nand momentum of electrons have to be \nreplaced by the statements of probability, \nthat the electron has at a given position and momentum. This is what happens in the quantum mechanical model of atom.= 0.579×107 m s–1\t(1J\t=\t1\tkg\tm2 s–2)= 5.79×106 m s–1Problem 2.16 A golf ball has a mass of 40g, and a speed of 45 m/s. If the speed can be measured \nwithin accuracy of 2%, calculate the \nuncertainty in the position.SolutionThe uncertainty in the speed is 2%, i.e., Using the equation (2.22)= 1.46×10–33 mThis is nearly ~ 1018 times smaller than the diameter of a typical atomic \nnucleus. As mentioned earlier for large \nparticles, the uncertainty principle sets \nno meaningful limit to the precision of \nmeasurements.Reasons for the Failure of the Bohr ModelOne can now understand the reasons for the failure of the Bohr model. In  Bohr model, \nan electron is regarded as a charged particle �moving\t\tin\twell\tdefined\tcircular\torbits\tabout\tthe nucleus. The wave character of the \nelectron is not considered in  Bohr model. �Further,\tan\torbit\tis\ta\tclearly\tdefined\tpath\tand this path can completely be defined only if both the position and the velocity of \nthe electron are known exactly at the same \ntime. This is not possible according to the \nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr model \nof the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only \nignores dual behaviour of matter but also �contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Problem 2.15A microscope using suitable photons is employed to locate an electron in an atom \nwithin a distance of 0.1 Å. What is the \nuncertainty involved in the measurement \nof its velocity?Solution∆ x ∆p =  or ∆ x m ∆ v  Unit 2.indd   529/9/2022   4:28:16 PM53In view of these inherent weaknesses in the Bohr model, there was no point in extending \nBohr model to other atoms. In fact an insight \ninto the structure of the atom was needed \nwhich could account for wave-particle duality \nof matter and be consistent with Heisenberg \nuncertainty principle. This came with the \nadvent of quantum mechanics.2.6  QUANTUM MECHANICAL MODEL OF ATOMClassical mechanics, based on Newton’s laws of motion, successfully describes the motion of all macroscopic objects such as a \nfalling stone, orbiting planets etc., which have \nessentially a particle-like behaviour as shown \nin the previous section. However it fails when \napplied to microscopic objects like electrons, \natoms, molecules etc. This is mainly because \nof the fact that classical mechanics ignores \nthe concept of dual behaviour of matter \nespecially for sub-atomic particles and the \nuncertainty principle. The branch of science \nthat takes into account  this dual behaviour \nof matter is called quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is a theoretical science that deals with the study of the \nmotions of the microscopic objects that have \nboth observable wave like and particle like �properties.\tIt\tspecifies\tthe\tlaws\tof\tmotion\tthat\tthese objects obey. When quantum mechanics is applied to macroscopic objects (for which wave\tlike\tproperties\tare\tinsignificant)\tthe\tresults are the same as those from the classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics was developed independently in 1926 by Werner Heisenberg \nand Erwin Schrödinger. Here, however, we \nshall be discussing the quantum mechanics \nwhich is based on the ideas of wave motion. \nThe fundamental equation of quantum \nmechanics was developed by Schrödinger  \nand it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in \n1933. This equation which incorporates wave-\nparticle duality of matter as proposed by de \nBroglie is quite complex and knowledge of \nhigher mathematics  is needed to solve it. You \nwill learn its solutions for different systems \nin higher classes. For a system (such as an atom or a molecule whose energy does not change with time) the Schrödinger equation is written as  where  is a mathematical operator called Hamiltonian. Schrödinger \ngave a recipe of constructing this operator \nfrom the expression for the total energy of \nthe system. The total energy of the system \ntakes into account the kinetic energies of all \nthe sub-atomic particles (electrons, nuclei), \nattractive potential between the electrons \nand nuclei and repulsive potential among the \nelectrons and nuclei individually. Solution of this equation gives E and ψ.Hydrogen Atom and the Schrödinger \nEquationWhen Schrödinger equation is solved for hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible \nenergy levels the electron can occupy and \nthe corresponding wave function(s) (ψ) of the electron associated with each energy \nlevel. These quantized energy states and \ncorresponding wave functions which are \ncharacterized by a set of three quantum \nnumbers (principal quantum number \nn, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number ml ) arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the \nSchrödinger equation. When an electron is in any energy state, the wave function Erwin Schrödinger, an Austrian physicist received \nhis Ph.D. in theoretical \nphysics from the University �of Vienna in 1910. In 1927 \nSchrödinger succeeded Max \nPlanck at the  University of \nBerlin at Planck’s request. \nIn 1933, Schrödinger left \nBerlin because of his �opposition to Hitler and \nNazi policies and returned \nto Austria in 1936. After the invasion of Austria \nby Germany, Schrödinger was forcibly removed �from his professorship. He then moved to Dublin, \nIreland where he remained for seventeen years. \nSchrödinger shared the Nobel Prize for Physics \nwith P.A.M. Dirac in 1933.Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961)Unit 2.indd   539/9/2022   4:28:17 PM54corresponding to that energy state contains all information about the electron. The wave \nfunction is a mathematical function whose \nvalue depends upon the coordinates of the \nelectron in the atom and does not carry any \nphysical meaning. Such wave functions of \nhydrogen or hydrogen like species with one \nelectron are called atomic orbitals. Such \nwave functions pertaining to one-electron \nspecies are called one-electron systems. The �probability\tof\tfinding\tan\telectron\tat\ta\tpoint\twithin an atom is proportional to the |ψ|2 at that point.  The quantum mechanical results \nof the hydrogen atom successfully predict \nall aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum \nincluding some phenomena that could not be \nexplained by the Bohr model.Application of  Schrödinger equation to multi-electron\tatoms\tpresents\ta\tdifficulty:\tthe\tSchrödinger equation cannot be solved exactly �for\ta\tmulti-electron\tatom.\tThis\tdifficulty\tcan\tbe overcome by using approximate methods. \nSuch calculations with the aid of modern computers show that orbitals in atoms other \nthan hydrogen do not differ in any radical \nway from the hydrogen orbitals discussed \nabove. The principal difference lies in the \nconsequence of increased nuclear charge. \nBecause of this  all the orbitals are somewhat \ncontracted. Further, as you shall see later (in \nsubsections 2.6.3 and 2.6.4), unlike orbitals \nof hydrogen or hydrogen like species, whose \nenergies depend only on the quantum number \nn, the energies of the orbitals in multi-electron atoms depend on quantum numbers n and l.Important Features of the Quantum Mechanical Model of AtomQuantum mechanical model of atom is the picture of the structure of the atom, which emerges from the application of the Schrödinger equation to atoms. The \nfollowing are the important features of the quantum-mechanical model of atom:1. The energy of electrons in atoms is quantized (i.e., can only have certain specific values), for example when \nelectrons are bound to the nucleus in \natoms.2. The existence of quantised electronic \nenergy levels is a direct result of the \nwave like properties of electrons and \nare allowed solutions of Schrödinger wave equation.3. Both the exact position and exact \nvelocity of an electron in an atom cannot be determined simultaneously \n(Heisenberg uncertainty principle). The \npath of an electron in an atom  therefore, \ncan never be determined or known \naccurately. That is why, as you shall see \nlater on, one talks of only probability of �finding\tthe\telectron\tat\tdifferent\tpoints\tin\t an atom.4. An atomic orbital is the wave function ψ for an electron in an atom. Whenever an electron is described \nby a wave function, we say that the \nelectron occupies that orbital. Since \nmany such wave functions are possible \nfor an electron, there are many atomic \norbitals in an atom. These “one electron \norbital wave functions” or orbitals form \nthe basis of the electronic structure \nof atoms. In each orbital, the electron �has\ta\tdefinite\tenergy.\tAn\torbital\tcannot\tcontain more than two electrons. In a multi-electron atom, the electrons are �filled\tin\tvarious\torbitals\tin\tthe\torder\tof\tincreasing energy. For each electron \nof a multi-electron atom, there shall, \ntherefore, be an orbital wave function characteristic of the orbital it occupies. \nAll the information about the electron \nin an atom is stored in its orbital wave \nfunction ψ and quantum mechanics makes it possible to extract this \ninformation out of ψ.5.\tThe\tprobability\tof\tfinding\tan\telectron\tat\ta point within an atom is proportional to the square of the orbital wave function \ni.e., |ψ|2 at that point. |ψ|2 is known as probability density and is always positive. From the value of |ψ|2 at different points within an atom, \nit is possible to predict the region \naround the nucleus where electron \nwill most probably be found.2.6.1 Orbitals and Quantum Numbers A large number of orbitals are possible in an atom. Qualitatively these orbitals can Unit 2.indd   549/9/2022   4:28:17 PM55be distinguished by their size, shape and orientation. An orbital of smaller size means �there\tis\tmore\tchance\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tnear the nucleus. Similarly shape and orientation mean that there is more probability �of\tfinding\tthe\telectron\talong\tcertain\tdirections\tthan along others. Atomic orbitals are precisely \ndistinguished by what are known as quantum \nnumbers. Each orbital is designated by three quantum numbers labelled as n, l and ml. The principal quantum number ‘n’ is a positive integer with value of n = 1,2,3....... \nThe principal quantum number determines the size and to large extent the energy of the orbital. For hydrogen atom and hydrogen like species (He+, Li2+, .... etc.) energy and size of the orbital depends only on ‘n’.The principal quantum number also identifies\tthe\tshell. With the increase in the value of ‘n’, the number of allowed orbital increases and are given by ‘n2’ All the orbitals of a given value of ‘n’ constitute a single shell of atom and are represented \nby the following letters      n =  1   2   3   4   ............ Shell =   K  L  M  N ............ Size of an orbital increases with increase of principal quantum number ‘n’. In other words the electron will be located away from the nucleus. Since energy is required in shifting \naway the negatively charged electron from the \npositively charged nucleus, the energy of the \norbital will increase with increase of n. Azimuthal quantum number. ‘l’ is also known as orbital angular momentum or subsidiary quantum number.\tIt\tdefines\tthe\tthree-dimensional shape of the orbital. For a \ngiven value of n, l  can have n values ranging from 0 to n – 1, that is, for a given value of n, the possible value of l are : l = 0, 1, 2, .......... (n–1)For example, when n = 1, value of l is only 0. For n = 2, the possible value of l can be 0 \nand 1. For n = 3, the possible l values are 0, 1 and 2.Each shell consists of one or more  sub-shells or sub-levels. The number of  sub-shells in a principal shell is equal to the value of n.\tFor\texample\tin\tthe\tfirst\tshell\t(n = 1), there is only one sub-shell which corresponds \nto l = 0. There are two sub-shells (l = 0, 1) in the second shell (n = 2), three (l = 0, 1, 2) in \nthird shell (n = 3) and so on. Each sub-shell is assigned an azimuthal quantum number (l). Sub-shells corresponding to different values \nof l are represented by the following symbols.Value for l : 0   1 2   3 4   5 ............notation for  s   p d   f g   h ............sub-shell Table 2.4 shows the permissible values of ‘l ’ for a given principal quantum number and the corresponding sub-shell notation.Magnetic orbital quantum number. ‘ml’ gives information about the spatial orientation of the orbital with respect to \nstandard set of co-ordinate axis. For any �sub-shell (defined by ‘l’ value) 2l+1 values of ml are possible and these values are given by :ml  = – l, – (l–1), – (l–2)... 0,1... (l–2), (l–1), l Thus for l = 0, the only permitted value of ml = 0, [2(0)+1 = 1, one s orbital]. For l = 1, ml can be –1, 0 and +1 [2(1)+1 = 3, three p orbitals]. For l = 2, ml = –2, –1, 0, +1 and +2, [2(2)+1\t=\t5,\tfive\td orbitals]. It should be noted that the values of ml are derived from l and that the value of l are derived from n.Table 2.4  Subshell NotationsnlSubshell notation12\n2\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\n4\n40\n0\n1\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n31s�2s2p3s3p3d4s4p4d4fUnit 2.indd   559/9/2022   4:28:17 PM56Each orbital in an atom, therefore, is defined\tby\ta\tset\tof\tvalues\tfor\tn, l and ml. An orbital described by the quantum numbers  n = 2, l = 1, ml = 0 is an orbital in the p sub-shell of the second shell. The following chart gives the relation between the subshell and \nthe number of orbitals associated with it.Value of l012345Subshell notationspdfghnumber of orbitals1357911Electron spin ‘s’ : The three quantum numbers labelling an atomic orbital can be �used\tequally\twell\tto\tdefine\tits\tenergy,\tshape\tand orientation. But all these quantum \nnumbers are not enough to explain the line \nspectra observed in the case of multi-electron atoms, that is, some of the lines actually occur \nin doublets (two lines closely spaced), triplets \n(three lines, closely spaced) etc. This suggests \nthe presence of a few more energy levels than \npredicted by the three quantum numbers.In 1925, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit proposed the presence of the fourth quantum number known as the electron \nspin quantum number (ms). An electron spins around its own axis, much in a similar \nway as earth spins around its own axis while \nrevolving around the sun. In other words, \nan electron has, besides charge and mass, \nintrinsic spin angular quantum number. Spin angular momentum of the electron — a vector quantity, can have two orientations relative to \nthe chosen axis. These two orientations are \ndistinguished by the spin quantum numbers \nms which can take the values of +½ or –½. These are called the two spin states of the \nelectron and are normally represented by two arrows, ↑ (spin up) and ↓ (spin down). Two electrons that have different ms values (one +½ and the other –½) are said to have opposite spins. An orbital cannot hold more than two \nelectrons and these two electrons should have \nopposite spins.To sum up, the four quantum numbers provide the following information :i) n\tdefines\tthe\tshell,\t\tdetermines\tthe\tsize\tof the orbital and also to a large extent \nthe energy of the orbital.ii) There are n subshells in the nth shell. l identifies\tthe\tsubshell\tand\tdetermines\tthe shape of the orbital (see section 2.6.2). There are (2l+1) orbitals of each \ntype in a subshell, that is, one s orbital \n(l = 0), three p orbitals (l\t=\t1)\tand\tfive\td orbitals (l = 2) per subshell. To some extent l also determines the energy of the orbital in a multi-electron atom.iii) ml designates the orientation of the orbital. For a given value of l, ml has (2l+1) values, the same as the number \nof orbitals per subshell. It means that Orbit, orbital and its importanceOrbit and orbital are not synonymous. An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path around the nucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the electron is impossible \naccording to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore, have no real meaning and \ntheir existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An atomic orbital, on the other hand, \nis a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one electron wave function ψ in an atom. It is characterized by three quantum numbers (n, l and ml) and its value depends upon the coordinates of the electron. ψ has, by itself, no physical meaning. It is the square of the wave function i.e., |ψ|2 which has a physical meaning. |ψ|2 at any point in an atom gives the value of probability density at that point. Probability density (|ψ|2) is the probability per unit volume and the product of |ψ|2 and\ta\tsmall\tvolume\t(called\ta\tvolume\telement)\tyields\tthe\tprobability\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tin\tthat\tvolume (the reason for specifying a small volume element is that |ψ|2 varies from one region to another in space but its value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element). �The\ttotal\tprobability\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tin\ta\tgiven\tvolume\tcan\tthen\tbe\tcalculated\tby\tthe\tsum\tof all the products of |ψ|2 and the corresponding volume elements. It is thus possible to get the probable distribution of an electron in an orbital.Unit 2.indd   569/9/2022   4:28:17 PM57the number of orbitals is equal to the number of ways in which they are \noriented. iv) ms refers to orientation of the spin of the electron.According to the German physicist, Max Born, the square of the wave function  (i.e.,ψ 2) at a point gives the probability density of the electron at that point. The variation \nof ψ 2 as a function of r for 1s and 2s orbitals is given in Fig. 2.12(b). Here again, you may \nnote that the curves for 1s and 2s orbitals \nare different.It may be noted that for 1s orbital the probability density is maximum at the \nnucleus and it decreases sharply as we move \naway from it. On the other hand, for 2s �orbital\tthe\tprobability\tdensity\tfirst\tdecreases\tsharply to zero and again starts increasing. \nAfter reaching a small maxima it decreases again and approaches zero as the value of \nr increases further. The region where this probability density function reduces to zero is called nodal surfaces or simply nodes. In general, it has been found that ns-orbital \nhas (n – 1) nodes, that is, number of nodes \nincreases with increase of principal quantum \nnumber n. In other words, number of nodes for 2s orbital is one, two for 3s and so on.These probability density variation can be visualised in terms of charge cloud diagrams \n[Fig. 2.13(a)]. In these diagrams, the density Fig. 2.12 The plots of (a) the orbital wave  function ψ(r); (b) the variation of probability density ψ2(r) as a function of distance r of the electron from the �nucleus for 1s and 2s orbitals. Problem 2.17 What is the total number of orbitals associated with the principal quantum \nnumber n = 3 ?SolutionFor n = 3, the possible values of l are 0, 1 and 2. Thus there is one 3s orbital  (n = 3, l = 0 and ml = 0); there are three 3p orbitals (n = 3, l = 1 and ml = –1, 0, +1);\tthere\tare\tfive\t3d orbitals (n = 3, l = 2 and ml = –2, –1, 0, +1+, +2).Therefore, the total number of orbitals \nis 1+3+5 = 9The same value can also be obtained by using the relation; number of orbitals  = n2, i.e.  32 = 9.Problem 2.18 Using s, p, d, f notations, describe the orbital with the following quantum numbers (a) n = 2, l = 1, (b) n = 4, l = 0, (c) n = 5,  l = 3, (d) n = 3, l = 2Solution  n   l orbital    a)  2  1   2p    b)  4  0   4s    c)  5  3   5f    d)  3  2   3d2.6.2 Shapes of Atomic OrbitalsThe orbital wave function or ψ for an electron in an atom has no physical meaning. It is simply a mathematical function of the \ncoordinates of the electron. However, for \ndifferent orbitals the plots of corresponding \nwave functions as a function of r (the distance from the nucleus) are different. Fig. 2.12(a), \ngives such plots for 1s (n = 1, l = 0) and 2s  (n = 2, l = 0) orbitals. Unit 2.indd   579/9/2022   4:28:17 PM58of the dots in a region represents electron probability density in that region.Boundary surface diagrams of constant probability density for different orbitals give a fairly good representation of the shapes \nof the orbitals. In this representation, a \nboundary surface or contour surface is \ndrawn in space for an orbital on which the \nvalue of probability density |ψ|2 is constant. In principle many such boundary surfaces \nmay be possible. However, for a given \norbital, only that boundary surface diagram \nof constant probability density* is taken to \nbe good representation of the shape of the \norbital which encloses a region or volume in �which\tthe\tprobability\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tis very high, say, 90%. The boundary surface diagram for 1s and 2s orbitals are given in  Fig. 2.13(b). One may ask a question : Why \ndo we not draw a boundary surface diagram, \nwhich bounds a region in which the probability �of\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tis,\t100\t%?\tThe\tanswer\tto this question is that the probability density \n|ψ|2 has always some value, howsoever small\tit\tmay\tbe,\tat\tany\tfinite\tdistance\tfrom\tthe nucleus. It is therefore, not possible to draw a boundary surface diagram of a rigid �size\tin\twhich\tthe\tprobability\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron is 100%. Boundary surface diagram \nfor a s orbital is actually a sphere centred on the nucleus. In two dimensions, this sphere \nlooks like a circle. It encloses a region in �which\tprobability\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tis\tabout 90%.Thus, we see that 1s and 2s orbitals are spherical in shape. In reality all the s-orbitals \nare spherically symmetric, that is, the �probability\tof\tfinding\tthe\telectron\tat\ta\tgiven\tdistance is equal in all the directions. It is also \nobserved that the size of the s orbital increases \nwith increase in n, that is, 4s \u003e 3s \u003e 2s \u003e 1s and the electron is located further away from \nthe nucleus as the principal quantum number \nincreases.Boundary surface diagrams for three 2p orbitals (l = 1) are shown in Fig. 2.14. In these diagrams, the nucleus is at the origin. \nHere, unlike s-orbitals, the boundary surface \ndiagrams are not spherical. Instead each  p orbital consists of two sections called lobes \nthat are on either side of the plane that passes \nthrough the nucleus. The probability density * If probability density |ψ|2 is constant on a given surface, |ψ| is also constant over the surface. The boundary surface for |ψ|2 and |ψ| are identical.Fig. 2.14 Boundary surface diagrams of the �three 2p orbitals.Fig. 2.13 (a) Probability density plots of 1s and 2s atomic orbitals. The density of the \ndots represents the probability density �of finding the electron in that region.  (b) Boundary surface diagram for 1s �and 2s orbitals.Unit 2.indd   589/9/2022   4:28:19 PM59function is zero on the plane where the two lobes touch each other. The size, shape and \nenergy of the three orbitals are identical. \nThey differ however, in the way the lobes are \noriented. Since the lobes may be considered to \nlie along the x, y or z axis, they are given the \ndesignations 2px, 2py, and 2pz. It should be understood, however, that there is no simple \nrelation between the values of ml (–1, 0 and +1) and the x, y and z directions. For our purpose, it\tis\tsufficient\tto\tremember\tthat,\tbecause\tthere are three possible values of ml, there are, therefore, three p orbitals whose axes are mutually perpendicular. Like s orbitals, \np orbitals increase in size and energy with \nincrease in the principal quantum number \nand hence the order of the energy and size of \nvarious p orbitals is 4p \u003e 3p \u003e 2p. Further, like s orbitals, the probability density functions for \np-orbital also pass through value zero, besides at\tzero\tand\tinfinite\tdistance,\tas\tthe\tdistance\tfrom the nucleus increases. The number of \nnodes are given by the n –2, that is number of radial node is 1 for 3p orbital, two for 4p orbital and so on.For l = 2, the orbital is known as d-orbital and the minimum value of principal quantum \nnumber (n) has to be 3. as the value of l cannot be greater than n–1.\tThere\tare\tfive\tml values (–2, –1, 0, +1 and +2) for l = 2 and thus there �are\tfive\td orbitals. The boundary surface diagram of d orbitals are shown in Fig. 2.15.The\tfive\td-orbitals are designated as dxy, dyz, dxz, dx2–y2 and dz2.\tThe\tshapes\tof\tthe\tfirst\tfour d-orbitals are similar to each other, where as\tthat\tof\tthe\tfifth\tone,\tdz2, is different from others,\tbut\tall\tfive\t3d orbitals are equivalent in energy. The d orbitals for which n is greater than 3 (4d, 5d...) also have shapes similar to 3d orbital, but differ in energy and size.Besides the radial nodes (i.e., probability density function is zero), the probability \ndensity functions for the np and nd orbitals \nare zero at the plane (s), passing through the \nnucleus (origin). For example, in case of pz orbital, xy-plane is a nodal plane, in case of \ndxy orbital, there are two nodal planes passing through the origin and bisecting the xy plane \ncontaining z-axis. These are called angular \nnodes and number of angular nodes are given \nby ‘l’, i.e., one angular node for p orbitals, two angular nodes for ‘d’ orbitals and so on. The total number of nodes are given by (n–1), i.e., sum of l angular nodes and (n – l – 1) radial nodes.2.6.3 Energies of OrbitalsThe energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom is determined solely by the principal quantum Fig. 2.15 Boundary surface diagrams of the five 3d orbitals.Unit 2.indd   599/9/2022   4:28:20 PM60number. Thus the energy of the orbitals in hydrogen atom  increases as follows :1s \u003c 2s = 2p \u003c 3s = 3p = 3d \u003c4s = 4p = 4d = 4f \u003c                                               (2.23) and is depicted in Fig. 2.16. Although the shapes of 2s and 2p orbitals are different, an electron has the same energy when it is \nin the 2s orbital as when it is present in 2p \norbital. The orbitals having the same energy \nare called degenerate. The 1s orbital in a hydrogen atom, as said earlier, corresponds \nto the most stable condition and is called the \nground state and an electron residing in this \norbital is most strongly held by the nucleus. \nAn electron in the 2s, 2p or higher orbitals in \na hydrogen atom is in excited state.The energy of an electron in a multi- electron atom, unlike that of the hydrogen atom, depends not only on its principal \nquantum number (shell), but also on its \nazimuthal quantum number (subshell). That \nis, for a given principal quantum number, s,  p, d, f ... all have different energies. Within a given principal quantum number, the \nenergy of orbitals increases in the order \ns\u003cp\u003cd\u003cf. For higher energy levels, these differences\tare\tsufficiently\tpronounced\tand\tstraggering of orbital energy may result, e.g., 4s\u003c3d and 6s\u003c5d; 4f\u003c6p. The main reason for having different energies of the \nsubshells is the mutual repulsion among the \nelectrons in multi-electron atoms. The only \nelectrical interaction present in hydrogen \natom is the attraction between the negatively \ncharged electron and the positively charged nucleus. In multi-electron atoms, besides the \npresence of attraction between the electron \nand nucleus, there are repulsion terms \nbetween every electron and other electrons \npresent in the atom. Thus the stability of an \nelectron in a multi-electron atom is because \ntotal attractive interactions are more than \nthe repulsive interactions. In general, the \nrepulsive interaction of the electrons in the \nouter shell with the electrons in the inner shell \nare more important. On the other hand, the \nattractive interactions of an electron increases \nwith increase of positive charge (Ze) on the �nucleus.\tDue\tto\tthe\tpresence\tof\telectrons\tin\tthe inner shells, the electron in the outer shell \nwill not experience the full positive charge of \nthe nucleus (Ze). The effect will be lowered due to the partial screening of positive charge \non the nucleus by the inner shell electrons. \nThis is known as the shielding of the outer shell electrons from the nucleus  by the \ninner shell electrons, and the net positive \ncharge experienced by the outer electrons is \nknown as effective nuclear charge (Zeff e). Despite\tthe\tshielding\tof\tthe\touter\telectrons\tfrom the nucleus by the inner shell electrons, \nthe attractive force experienced by the outer \nshell electrons increases with increase of \nnuclear charge. In other words, the energy of \ninteraction between, the nucleus and electron Fig. 2.16 Energy level diagrams for the few electronic shells of (a) hydrogen atom and (b) multi-electronic atoms. Note that \norbitals for the same value of principal \nquantum number, have the same \nenergies even for different azimuthal \nquantum number for hydrogen atom. \nIn case of multi-electron atoms, orbitals \nwith same principal quantum number \npossess different energies for different \nazimuthal quantum numbers.Unit 2.indd   609/9/2022   4:28:20 PM61(that is orbital energy) decreases (that is  more negative) with the increase of atomic number (Z).Both the attractive and repulsive interactions depend upon the shell and shape of the orbital in which the electron is present. \nFor example electrons present in spherical \nshaped, s orbital shields the outer electrons from the nucleus more effectively as compared \nto electrons present in p orbital. Similarly electrons present in p orbitals shield the outer electrons from the nucleus more than the \nelectrons present in d orbitals, even though all  these orbitals are present in the same shell. \nFurther within a shell, due to spherical shape \nof s orbital, the s orbital electron spends more time close to the nucleus in comparison to p \norbital electron which spends more time in \nthe vicinity of nucleus in comparison to d \norbital electron. In other words, for a given shell (principal quantum number), the Zeff experienced by the electron decreases with increase of azimuthal quantum number (l), \nthat is, the s orbital electron will be more \ntightly bound to the nucleus than p orbital \nelectron which in turn will be better tightly \nbound than the d orbital electron. The energy \nof electrons in s orbital will be lower (more \nnegative) than that of p orbital electron which will have less energy than that of d \norbital electron and so on. Since the extent \nof shielding from the nucleus is different for \nelectrons in different orbitals, it leads to the \nsplitting of energy levels within the same \nshell (or same principal quantum number), \nthat is, energy of electron in an orbital, as \nmentioned earlier, depends upon the values \nof n and l. Mathematically, the dependence of energies of the orbitals on n and l are quite \ncomplicated but one simple rule is that, the \nlower the value of (n + l) for an orbital, the \nlower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same value of (n + l), the orbital with lower value of n will have the lower energy. The Table 2.5 illustrates the (n + l ) rule and Fig. 2.16 depicts the energy levels of multi-\nelectrons atoms. It may be noted that different \nsubshells of a particular shell have different \nenergies in case of multi-electrons atoms. \nHowever, in hydrogen atom, these have the same energy. Lastly it may be mentioned here \nthat energies of the orbitals in the same subshell decrease with increase in the \natomic number (Zeff). For example, energy of 2s orbital of hydrogen atom is greater than \nthat of 2s orbital of lithium and that of lithium is greater than that of sodium and so on, that is, E2s(H) \u003e E2s(Li) \u003e E2s(Na) \u003e E2s(K).2.6.4 Filling of Orbitals in AtomThe\tfilling\tof\telectrons\tinto\tthe\torbitals\tof\tdifferent atoms takes place according to \nthe aufbau principle which is based on the Pauli’s exclusion principle, the Hund’s rule \nof maximum multiplicity and the relative \nenergies of the orbitals.Aufbau PrincipleThe word ‘aufbau’ in German means ‘building up’. The building up of orbitals means the Table 2.5 Arrangement of Orbitals with Increasing Energy on the Basis of (n+l) RuleUnit 2.indd   619/9/2022   4:28:20 PM62filling up of orbitals with electrons. The principle states : In the ground state of the atoms, the orbitals are filled in order of their increasing energies. In other words, �electrons\tfirst\toccupy\tthe\tlowest\tenergy\torbital\tavailable to them and enter into higher energy \norbitals only after the lower energy orbitals are\tfilled.\tAs\tyou\thave\tlearnt\tabove,\tenergy\tof a given orbital depends upon effective nuclear charge and different type of orbitals \nare affected to different extent. Thus, there \nis no single ordering of energies of orbitals \nwhich will be universally correct for all atoms.However, following order of  energies of the orbitals is extremely useful:1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 4f, \n5d, 6p, 7s...The order may be remembered by using the method given in Fig. 2.17. Starting from the top, the direction of the arrows gives the order\tof\tfilling\tof\torbitals,\tthat\tis\tstarting\tfrom right top to bottom left. With respect to \nplacement of outermost valence electrons, \nit is remarkably accurate for all atoms. For example, valence electron in potassium must choose between 3d and 4s orbitals and as predicted by this sequence, it is found \nin 4s orbital. The above order should be assumed\tto\tbe\ta\trough\tguide\tto\tthe\tfilling\tof energy levels. In many cases, the orbitals \nare similar in energy and small changes in atomic structure may bring about a change �in\tthe\torder\tof\tfilling.\tEven\tthen,\tthe\tabove\tseries is a useful guide to the building of the \nelectronic structure of an atom provided that \nit is remembered that exceptions may occur.Pauli Exclusion PrincipleThe\tnumber\tof\telectrons\tto\tbe\tfilled\tin\tvarious\torbitals is restricted by the exclusion principle, given by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli (1926). According to this principle : No two electrons in an atom can have the same set \nof four quantum numbers. Pauli exclusion principle can also be stated as : “Only two electrons may exist in the same orbital and \nthese electrons must have opposite spin.” \nThis means that the two electrons can have the same value of three quantum numbers \nn, l and ml, but must have the opposite spin quantum number. The restriction imposed \nby Pauli’s exclusion principle on the number \nof electrons in an orbital helps in calculating \nthe capacity of electrons to be present in any \nsubshell. For example, subshell 1s comprises one orbital and thus the maximum number of \nelectrons present in 1s subshell can be two, in p and d subshells, the maximum number of \nelectrons can be 6 and 10 and so on. This can \nbe summed up as : the maximum number \nof electrons in the shell with principal \nquantum number n is equal to 2n2.Hund’s Rule of Maximum MultiplicityThis\trule\tdeals\twith\tthe\tfilling\tof\telectrons\tinto\tthe orbitals belonging to the same subshell (that is, orbitals of equal energy, called \ndegenerate orbitals). It states : pairing of Fig.2.17 Order of filling of orbitalsUnit 2.indd   629/9/2022   4:28:20 PM63electrons in the orbitals belonging to the same subshell (p, d or f) does not take place until each orbital belonging to that \nsubshell has got one electron each i.e., it \nis singly occupied.Since there are three p,\tfive\td and seven f orbitals, therefore, the pairing of electrons will \nstart in the p, d and f orbitals with the entry of 4th, 6th and 8th electron, respectively. It �has\tbeen\tobserved\tthat\thalf\tfilled\tand\tfully\tfilled\tdegenerate\tset\tof\torbitals\tacquire\textra\tstability due to their symmetry (see Section, \n2.6.7).2.6.5 Electronic Configuration of AtomsThe distribution of electrons into orbitals of an atom is called its electronic configuration. If one keeps in mind the basic rules which �govern\tthe\tfilling\tof\tdifferent\tatomic\torbitals,\tthe electronic configurations of different \natoms can be written very easily.The\telectronic\tconfiguration\tof\tdifferent\tatoms can be represented in two ways. For  example :(i)   sa pbdc ...... notation(ii)  Orbital diagram\n \n s                    p                       dIn the first notation, the subshell is represented by the respective letter symbol and the number of electrons present in the \nsubshell is depicted, as the super script, like a, b, c, ... etc. The similar subshell represented for different shells is differentiated by writing \nthe principal quantum number before the \nrespective subshell. In the second notation  \neach orbital of the subshell is represented \nby a box and the electron is represented by \nan arrow (↑) a positive spin or an arrow (↓)  \na negative spin. The advantage of second �notation\tover\tthe\tfirst\tis\tthat\tit\trepresents\tall\tthe four quantum numbers.The hydrogen atom has only one electron which goes in the orbital with the lowest energy, namely 1s.\tThe\telectronic\tconfiguration\tof\tthe\thydrogen atom is 1s1 meaning that it has one electron in the 1s orbital. The second electron in helium (He) can also occupy the 1s\torbital.\tIts\tconfiguration\tis,\ttherefore,\t1s2. As mentioned above, the two electrons differ \nfrom each other with opposite spin, as can be seen from the orbital diagram.The third electron of lithium (Li) is not allowed in the 1s orbital because of Pauli exclusion principle. It, therefore, takes the \nnext available choice, namely the 2s orbital. �The\telectronic\tconfiguration\tof\tLi\tis\t1s22s1. The 2s orbital can accommodate one more �electron.\tThe\tconfiguration\tof\tberyllium\t(Be)\tatom is, therefore, 1s2 2s2 (see Table 2.6, page\t66\tfor\tthe\telectronic\tconfigurations\tof\telements).In the next six elements—boron  (B, 1s22s22p1), carbon (C, 1s22s22p2), nitrogen (N, 1s22s22p3), oxygen (O, 1s22s22p4),\tfluorine\t(F, 1s22s22p5) and neon (Ne, 1s22s22p6), the 2p orbitals\tget\tprogressively\tfilled.\tThis\tprocess\tis completed with the neon atom. The orbital picture of these elements can be represented as follows :The electronic configuration of the elements sodium (Na,1s22s22p63s1) to argon  (Ar,1s22s22p63s23p6), follow exactly the same pattern as the elements from lithium to neon \nwith the difference that the 3s and 3p orbitals are\tgetting\tfilled\tnow.\tThis\tprocess\tcan\tbe\tsimplified\tif\twe\trepresent\tthe\ttotal\tnumber\tof\t\telectrons\tin\tthe\tfirst\ttwo\tshells\tby\tthe\tname of element neon (Ne). The electronic configuration\tof the elements from sodium to Unit 2.indd   639/9/2022   4:28:21 PM64argon can be written as (Na, [Ne]3s1) to (Ar, [Ne] 3s23p6). The electrons in the completely filled\tshells\tare\tknown\tas\tcore\telectrons\tand\tthe electrons that are added to the electronic shell with the highest principal quantum \nnumber are called valence electrons. For example, the electrons in Ne are the core \nelectrons and the electrons from Na to Ar are \nthe valence electrons. In potassium (K) and \ncalcium (Ca), the 4s orbital, being lower in \nenergy than the 3d orbitals, is occupied by \none and two electrons respectively.A new pattern is followed beginning with scandium (Sc). The 3d orbital, being lower in energy than the 4p\torbital,\tis\tfilled\tfirst.\tConsequently, in the next ten elements, scandium (Sc), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), \nchromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu) and zinc �(Zn),\tthe\tfive\t3d orbitals are progressively occupied. We may be puzzled by the fact that\tchromium\tand\tcopper\thave\tfive\tand\tten\telectrons in 3d orbitals rather than four and nine as their position would have indicated \nwith two-electrons in the 4s orbital. The �reason\tis\tthat\tfully\tfilled\torbitals\tand\thalf-filled\torbitals\thave\textra\tstability\t(that\tis,\tlower energy). Thus p3, p6, d5, d10,f 7, f14 etc. configurations,\twhich\tare\teither\thalf-filled\tor\tfully\tfilled,\tare\tmore\tstable.\tChromium\tand copper therefore adopt the d5 and d10 configuration (Section 2.6.7)[caution: exceptions do exist] With the saturation of the 3d orbitals, the\tfilling\tof\tthe\t4p orbital starts at gallium (Ga) and is complete at krypton (Kr). In the next eighteen elements from rubidium (Rb) to\txenon\t(Xe),\tthe\tpattern\tof\tfilling\tthe\t5s, 4d and 5p orbitals are similar to that of 4s, 3d and 4p orbitals as discussed above. Then \ncomes the turn of the 6s orbital. In caesium \n(Cs) and the barium (Ba), this orbital contains \none and two electrons, respectively. Then from �lanthanum\t(La)\tto\tmercury\t(Hg),\tthe\tfilling\tup\tof electrons takes place in 4f and 5d orbitals. After\tthis,\tfilling\tof\t6p, then 7s\tand\tfinally\t5f and 6d orbitals takes place. The elements after uranium (U) are all short-lived and all of them\tare\tproduced\tartificially.\tThe\telectronic\tconfigurations\tof\tthe\tknown\telements\t(as\tdetermined by spectroscopic methods) are tabulated in Table 2.6 (page 66).One may ask what is the utility of knowing the electron configuration? The modern \napproach to the chemistry, infact, depends \nalmost entirely on electronic distribution to \nunderstand and explain chemical behaviour. \nFor example, questions like why two or more \natoms combine to form molecules, why some \nelements are metals while others are non-\nmetals, why elements like helium and argon \nare not reactive but elements like the halogens �are\treactive,\tfind\tsimple\texplanation\tfrom\tthe\telectronic\tconfiguration.\tThese\tquestions\thave\tno\tanswer\tin\tthe\tDaltonian\tmodel\tof\tatom.\tA detailed understanding of the electronic \nstructure of atom is, therefore, very essential for getting an insight into the various aspects \nof modern chemical knowledge.2.6.6 Stability of Completely Filled and   Half Filled SubshellsThe\tground\tstate\telectronic\tconfiguration\tof\tthe atom of an element always corresponds to the state of the lowest total electronic energy. The\telectronic\tconfigurations\tof\tmost\tof\tthe\tatoms follow the basic rules given in Section 2.6.5. However, in certain elements such as \nCu, or Cr, where the two subshells (4s and \n3d) differ slightly in their energies, an electron shifts from a subshell of lower energy (4s) to a subshell of higher energy (3d), provided such \na shift results in all orbitals of the subshell \nof higher energy getting either completely �filled\tor\thalf\tfilled.\tThe\tvalence\telectronic\tconfigurations\tof\tCr\tand\tCu,\ttherefore,\tare\t3d5 4s1 and 3d10 4s1 respectively and not 3d4 4s2 and 3d9 4s2. It has been found that there is extra stability associated with these electronic �configurations.Unit 2.indd   649/9/2022   4:28:21 PM65The completely filled and completely  half-filled\tsubshells\tare\tstable\tdue\tto\tthe\tfollowing reasons:1.Symmetrical distribution of \nelectrons: It is well known that symmetry leads\tto\tstability.\tThe\tcompletely\tfilled\tor\thalf\tfilled\tsubshells\thave\tsymmetrical\tdistribution of electrons in them and \nare therefore more stable. Electrons in \nthe same subshell (here 3d) have equal \nenergy but different spatial distribution. Consequently, their shielding of one-\nanother is relatively small and the \nelectrons are more strongly attracted by \nthe nucleus.\n2. Exchange Energy : The stabilizing \neffect arises whenever two or more \nelectrons with the same spin are present \nin the degenerate orbitals of a subshell. \nThese electrons tend to exchange their \npositions and the energy released due to \nthis exchange is called exchange energy. \nThe number of exchanges that can take \nplace is maximum when the subshell �is\teither\thalf\tfilled\tor\tcompletely\tfilled\t (Fig. 2.18). As a result the exchange energy is maximum and so is the stability. You may note that the exchange energy is at the basis of Hund’s rule \nthat electrons which enter orbitals of \nequal energy have parallel spins as far \nas possible. In other words, the extra �stability\tof\thalf-filled\tand\tcompletely\tfilled\tsubshell is  due to: (i) relatively small shielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion \nenergy, and (iii) larger exchange energy. �Details\tabout\tthe\texchange\tenergy\twill\tbe\tdealt with in higher classes.Fig. 2.18 Possible exchange for a d5 configurationCauses of Stability of Completely Filled and Half-filled SubshellsUnit 2.indd   659/9/2022   4:28:21 PM66Table 2.6  Electronic Configurations of the Elements* Elements with exceptional electronic configurationsUnit 2.indd   669/9/2022   4:28:22 PM67** Elements with atomic number 112 and above have been reported but not yet fully authenticated and named.Unit 2.indd   679/9/2022   4:28:23 PM68SUMMARYAtoms are the building blocks of elements. They are the smallest parts of an element that chemically\treact.\tThe\tfirst\tatomic\ttheory,\tproposed\tby\tJohn\tDalton\tin\t1808,\tregarded\tatom\tas\tthe ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was proved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles: \nelectrons, protons and neutrons. The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal of various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.Thomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity with electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to \nbe evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle \nscattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively \ncharged nucleus, at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits. Rutherford model, which resembles the solar system, was no doubt an improvement over Thomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e., why the electron does not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of \natoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The �difficulties\tof\tthe\tRutherford\tmodel\twere\tovercome\tby\tNiels\tBohr\tin\t1913\tin\this\tmodel\tof\tthe\thydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in circular orbits. Only\tcertain\torbits\tcan\texist\tand\teach\torbit\tcorresponds\tto\ta\tspecific\tenergy.\tBohr\tcalculated\tthe energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the \nelectron and nucleus. Bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the spectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron atoms. The reason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged �particle\tmoving\tin\ta\twell\tdefined\tcircular\torbit\tabout\tthe\tnucleus.\tThe\twave\tcharacter\tof\tthe\telectron\tis\tignored\tin\tBohr’s\ttheory.\tAn\torbit\tis\ta\tclearly\tdefined\tpath\tand\tthis\tpath\tcan\tcompletely\tbe\tdefined\tonly\tif\tboth\tthe\texact\tposition\tand\tthe\texact\tvelocity\tof\tthe\telectron\tat the same time are known. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour \nof electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Erwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to describe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This \nequation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with Heisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a \nhydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and \nthe corresponding wave function(s) (ψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the electron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding \nwave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal quantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number ml) arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions \non the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The \nquantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the \nhydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the \nBohr model.According to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an atom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought to consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or \nmore orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems \n(such as He+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of the orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value of (n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (n + l ) value, the orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are Unit 2.indd   689/9/2022   4:28:23 PM69possible\tand\telectrons\tare\tfilled\tin\tthose\torbitals\tin\torder\tof\tincreasing\tenergy\tin\taccordance\twith Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers) and Hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity (pairing of electrons in the orbitals belonging to the same subshell does not take place until each orbital belonging to that subshell has got one electron each, i.e., is singly occupied). This forms the basis of the \nelectronic structure of atoms.EXERCISES2.1 (i) Calculate the number of electrons which will together weigh one gram.

    "input": "UNIT 6EQUILIBRIUMChemical equilibria are important in numerous biological and environmental processes. For example, equilibria \ninvolving O2 molecules and the protein hemoglobin play a crucial role in the transport and delivery of O2 from our lungs to our muscles. Similar equilibria involving CO \nmolecules and hemoglobin account for the toxicity of CO.When a liquid evaporates in a closed container, molecules with relatively higher kinetic energy escape \nthe liquid surface into the vapour phase and number of \nliquid molecules from the vapour phase strike the liquid \nsurface and are retained in the liquid phase. It gives rise \nto a constant vapour pressure because of an equilibrium in which the number of molecules leaving the liquid equals the \nnumber returning to liquid from the vapour. We say that \nthe system has reached equilibrium state at this stage. \nHowever, this is not static equilibrium and there is a lot of \nactivity at the boundary between the liquid and the vapour. \nThus, at equilibrium, the rate of evaporation is equal to the rate of condensation. It may be represented byH2O (l)   H2O (vap)The double half arrows indicate that the processes in both the directions are going on simultaneously. The \nmixture of reactants and products in the equilibrium state \nis called an equilibrium mixture.Equilibrium can be established for both physical processes and chemical reactions. The reaction may be \nfast or slow depending on the experimental conditions and \nthe nature of the reactants. When the reactants in a closed \nvessel at a particular temperature react to give products, \nthe concentrations of the reactants keep on decreasing, \nwhile those of products keep on increasing for some time \nafter which there is no change in the concentrations of either of the reactants or products. This stage of the \nsystem is the dynamic equilibrium and the rates of the forward and reverse reactions become equal. It is due to After studying this unit you will be able to • identify dynamic nature of  equilibrium involved in physical and chemical processes;• state the law of equilibrium; • explain characteristics of equilibria involved in physical and chemical processes;• write expressions for equilibrium \nconstants; • establish a relationship between \nKp and Kc;• explain various factors that \naffect the equilibrium state of a \nreaction;• classify substances as acids or \nbases according to Arrhenius, \nBronsted-Lowry and Lewis \nconcepts;• classify acids and bases as \nweak or strong in terms of their ionization constants; • explain the dependence of degree of ionization on concentration \nof the electrolyte and that of the common ion;• describe pH scale for representing hydrogen ion concentration;• explain ionisation of water and \nits duel role as acid and base;• describe ionic product (Kw ) and pKw  for water;• appreciate use of buffer solutions;• calculate solubility product \nconstant.Unit 6.indd   1689/12/2022   11:58:20 AM169this dynamic equilibrium stage that there is no change in the concentrations of various \nspecies in the reaction mixture. Based on the \nextent to which the reactions proceed to reach \nthe state of chemical equilibrium, these may be classified in three groups.(i) The reactions that proceed nearly to completion and only negligible concentrations of the reactants are \nleft. In some cases, it may not be even \npossible to detect these experimentally.(ii) The reactions in which only small \namounts of products are formed and most of the reactants remain unchanged \nat equilibrium stage.(iii) The reactions in which the concentrations \nof the reactants and products are comparable, when the system is in \nequilibrium.The extent of a reaction in equilibrium varies with the experimental conditions such as concentrations of reactants, temperature, \netc. Optimisation of the operational conditions \nis very important in industry and laboratory \nso that equilibrium is favorable in the \ndirection of the desired product. Some \nimportant aspects of equilibrium involving \nphysical and chemical processes are dealt in \nthis unit along with the equilibrium involving \nions in aqueous solutions which is called as \nionic equilibrium.6.1 EQUILIBRIUM IN PHYSICAL PROCESSESThe characteristics of system at equilibrium are better understood if we examine some physical processes. The most familiar examples \nare phase transformation processes, e.g., solid        liquid  liquid        gas solid         gas6.1.1 Solid-Liquid EquilibriumIce and water kept in a perfectly insulated �thermos flask (no exchange of heat between its contents and the surroundings) at 273K and the atmospheric pressure are in equilibrium \nstate and the system shows interesting characteristic features. We observe that the mass of ice and water do not change with \ntime and the temperature remains constant. \nHowever, the equilibrium is not static. \nThe intense activity can be noticed at the \nboundary between ice and water. Molecules \nfrom the liquid water collide against ice and \nadhere to it and some molecules of ice escape \ninto liquid phase. There is no change of mass \nof ice and water, as the rates of transfer of \nmolecules from ice into water and of reverse \ntransfer from water into ice are equal at \natmospheric pressure and 273 K. It is obvious that ice and water are in equilibrium only at particular temperature and pressure. For any pure substance at atmospheric pressure, the temperature at \nwhich the solid and liquid phases are at \nequilibrium is called the normal melting point \nor normal freezing point of the substance.  The system here is in dynamic equilibrium and we \ncan infer the following:\n(i) Both the opposing processes occur \nsimultaneously.(ii) Both the processes occur at the same \nrate so that the amount of ice and water remains constant.6.1.2 Liquid-Vapour EquilibriumThis equilibrium can be better understood if we consider the example of a transparent box \ncarrying a U-tube with mercury (manometer). \nDrying agent like anhydrous calcium chloride (or phosphorus penta-oxide) is placed for \na few hours in the box. After removing the \ndrying agent by tilting the box on one side, a \nwatch glass (or petri dish) containing water \nis quickly placed inside the box. It will be \nobserved that the mercury level in the right \nlimb of the manometer slowly increases and �finally attains a constant value, that is, the \npressure inside the box increases and reaches \na constant value. Also the volume of water in \nthe watch glass decreases (Fig. 6.1). Initially \nthere was no water vapour (or very less) inside \nthe box. As water evaporated the pressure in \nthe box increased due to addition of water molecules into the gaseous phase inside \nthe box. The rate of evaporation is constant. Unit 6.indd   1699/12/2022   11:58:20 AM170However, the rate of increase in pressure decreases with time due to condensation \nof vapour into water. Finally it leads to an \nequilibrium condition when there is no net \nevaporation. This implies that the number \nof water molecules from the gaseous state \ninto the liquid state also increases till the \nequilibrium is attained i.e.,rate of evaporation= rate of condensationH2O(l)          H2O (vap)At equilibrium the pressure exerted by the water molecules at a given temperature \nremains constant and is called the equilibrium \nvapour pressure of water (or just vapour \npressure of water); vapour pressure of water \nincreases with temperature. If the above \nexperiment is repeated with methyl alcohol, \nacetone and ether, it is observed that different \nliquids have different equilibrium vapour \npressures at the same temperature, and the \nliquid which has a higher vapour pressure is \nmore volatile and has a lower boiling point. If we expose three watch glasses containing separately 1mL each of acetone, ethyl alcohol, \nand water to atmosphere and repeat the \nexperiment with different volumes of the \nliquids in a warmer room, it is observed \nthat in all such cases the liquid eventually \ndisappears and the time taken for complete \nevaporation depends on (i) the nature of the \nliquid, (ii) the amount of the liquid and (iii) the \ntemperature. When the watch glass is open \nto the atmosphere, the rate of evaporation \nremains constant but the molecules are dispersed into large volume of the room. As \na consequence the rate of condensation from vapour to liquid state is much less than the rate of evaporation. These are open systems \nand it is not possible to reach equilibrium in \nan open system.Water and water vapour are in equilibrium position at atmospheric pressure (1.013 bar) \nand at 100°C in a closed vessel. The boiling \npoint of water is 100°C at 1.013 bar pressure. \nFor any pure liquid at one atmospheric \npressure (1.013 bar), the temperature \nat which the liquid and vapours are at \nequilibrium is called normal boiling point of \nthe liquid. Boiling point of the liquid depends \non the atmospheric pressure. It depends on \nthe altitude of the place; at high altitude the \nboiling point decreases. 6.1.3 Solid – Vapour EquilibriumLet us now consider the systems where solids sublime to vapour phase. If we place solid iodine in a closed vessel, after sometime �the vessel gets filled up with violet vapour \nand the intensity of colour increases with \ntime. After certain time the intensity of \ncolour becomes constant and at this stage \nequilibrium is attained. Hence solid iodine \nsublimes to give iodine vapour and the iodine \nvapour condenses to give solid iodine. The \nequilibrium can be represented as,I2(solid)   I2 (vapour)Other examples showing this kind of equilibrium are,Camphor (solid)  Camphor (vapour)NH4Cl (solid)   NH4Cl (vapour)Fig. 6.1  Measuring equilibrium vapour pressure of water at a constant temperatureUnit 6.indd   1709/12/2022   11:58:21 AM1716.1.4 Equilibrium Involving Dissolution of Solid or Gases in LiquidsSolids in liquidsWe know from our experience that we can dissolve only a limited amount of salt or sugar in a given amount of water at room \ntemperature. If we make a thick sugar syrup \nsolution by dissolving sugar at a higher \ntemperature, sugar crystals separate out if we \ncool the syrup to the room temperature. We call \nit a saturated solution when no more of solute \ncan be dissolved in it at a given  temperature. \nThe concentration of the solute in a saturated \nsolution depends upon the temperature. In \na saturated solution, a dynamic equilibrium \nexits between the solute molecules in the solid \nstate and in the solution:Sugar (solution)  Sugar (solid), and the rate of dissolution of sugar = rate of crystallisation of sugar.Equality of the two rates and dynamic nature of equilibrium has been confirmed with the help of radioactive sugar. If we drop some \nradioactive sugar into saturated solution of \nnon-radioactive sugar, then after some time \nradioactivity is observed both in the solution \nand in the solid sugar. Initially there were no \nradioactive sugar molecules in the solution \nbut due to dynamic nature of equilibrium, \nthere is exchange between the radioactive \nand non-radioactive sugar molecules between \nthe two phases. The ratio of the radioactive \nto non-radioactive molecules in the solution \nincreases till it attains a constant value.Gases in liquidsWhen a soda water bottle is opened, some of the carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it fizzes \nout rapidly. The phenomenon arises due \nto difference in solubility of carbon dioxide \nat different pressures. There is equilibrium \nbetween the molecules in the gaseous state \nand the molecules dissolved in the liquid under pressure i.e.,CO2 (gas)  CO2 (in solution)This equilibrium is governed by Henry’s law, which states that the mass of a gas dissolved in a given mass of a solvent at \nany temperature is proportional to the pressure of the gas above the solvent. This amount decreases with increase of \ntemperature. The soda water bottle is sealed \nunder pressure of gas when its solubility in \nwater is high. As soon as the bottle is opened, \nsome of the dissolved carbon dioxide gas \nescapes to reach a new equilibrium condition \nrequired for the lower pressure, namely its \npartial pressure in the atmosphere. This is \nhow the soda water in bottle when left open to the air for some time, turns ‘flat’. It can be \ngeneralised that:(i) For solid  liquid equilibrium, there is only one temperature (melting point) at  1 atm (1.013 bar) at which the two phases can coexist. If there is no \nexchange of heat with the surroundings, \nthe mass of the two phases remains \nconstant.(ii) For liquid  vapour equilibrium, the vapour pressure is constant at a given \ntemperature.(iii) For dissolution of solids in liquids, \nthe solubility is constant at a given temperature.(iv) For dissolution of gases in liquids, \nthe concentration of a gas in liquid is proportional to the pressure \n(concentration) of the gas over the liquid. \nThese observations are summarised in \nTable 6.1Table 6.1 Some Features of Physical EquilibriaProcessConclusionLiquid VapourH2O (l)  H2O (g)pH2Oconstant at given temperatureSolid  LiquidH2O (s)  H2O (l)Melting point is fixed at constant pressureSolute(s)  Solute(solution)Sugar(s)  Sugar(solution)Concentration of solutein solution is constant\nat a given temperatureGas(g)  Gas (aq)CO2(g)  CO2(aq)[gas(aq)]/[gas(g)] is constant at a given \ntemperature  \n[CO2(aq)]/[CO2(g)] is constant at a given \ntemperature Unit 6.indd   17111/2/2022   4:10:42 PM1726.1.5 General Characteristics of Equilibria Involving Physical \nProcessesFor the physical processes discussed above, \nfollowing characteristics are common to the \nsystem at equilibrium:(i) Equilibrium is possible only in a closed system at a given temperature.(ii) Both the opposing processes occur at \nthe same rate and there is a dynamic \nbut stable condition.(iii) All measurable properties of the system \nremain constant.(iv) When equilibrium is attained for a \nphysical process, it is characterised by \nconstant value of one of its parameters at a given temperature. Table 6.1 lists \nsuch quantities.(v) The magnitude of such quantities at any \nstage indicates the extent to which the \nphysical process has proceeded before \nreaching equilibrium.6.2 EQUILIBRIUM IN CHEMICAL \nPROCESSES – DYNAMIC \nEQUILIBRIUMAnalogous to the physical systems chemical \nreactions also attain a state of equilibrium. \nThese reactions can occur both in forward \nand backward directions. When the rates of the forward and reverse reactions become \nequal, the concentrations of the reactants \nand the products remain constant. This \nis the stage of chemical equilibrium. This \nequilibrium is dynamic in nature as it consists \nof a forward reaction in which the reactants \ngive product(s) and reverse reaction in which \nproduct(s) gives the original reactants.For a better comprehension, let us consider a general case of a reversible reaction, A + B  C + DWith passage of time, there is accumulation of the products C and D and depletion of the reactants A and B (Fig. 6.2). This leads to a decrease in the rate of \nforward reaction and an increase in the rate \nof the reverse reaction,Fig. 6.2  Attainment of chemical equilibrium.Eventually, the two reactions occur at the same rate and the system reaches a state of equilibrium. Similarly, the reaction can reach the state of equilibrium even if we start with only C and \nD; that is, no A and B being present initially, \nas the equilibrium can be reached from either \ndirection.The dynamic nature of chemical equilibrium can be demonstrated in the \nsynthesis of ammonia by Haber’s process.  \nIn a series of experiments, Haber started \nwith known amounts of dinitrogen and \ndihydrogen maintained at high temperature \nand pressure and at regular intervals \ndetermined the amount of ammonia present. \nHe was successful in determining also the \nconcentration of unreacted dihydrogen and \ndinitrogen. Fig. 6.4 (page 174) shows that after \na certain time the composition of the mixture \nremains the same even though some of the \nreactants are still present. This constancy in \ncomposition indicates that the reaction has \nreached equilibrium. In order to understand \nthe dynamic nature of the reaction, synthesis \nof ammonia is carried out with exactly the \nsame starting conditions (of partial pressure \nand temperature) but using D2 (deuterium) in place of H2. The reaction mixtures starting either with H2 or D2 reach equilibrium with the same composition, except that D2 and ND3 are present instead of H2 and NH3.  After Unit 6.indd   17211/2/2022   4:10:43 PM173Dynamic Equilibrium – A Student’s ActivityEquilibrium whether in a physical or in a chemical system, is always of dynamic nature. This can be demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible in a school laboratory. \nHowever this concept can be easily comprehended by performing the following activity. The activity \ncan be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students.Take two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes each of 30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of 3-5mm. Fill \nnearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this purpose add a crystal \nof potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder (number 2) empty. Put one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder 1, close its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its lower portion to \ncylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2nd cylinder, transfer the coloured water in a similar manner from cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring coloured water using the two glass \ntubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you notice that the level of coloured water in both \nthe cylinders becomes constant.If you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will not be any further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take analogy of ‘level’ of \ncoloured water with ‘concentration’ of reactants and products in the two cylinders, we can say \nthe process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy of level, is indicative of dynamic �nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking two tubes of different diameters we find \nthat at equilibrium the level of coloured water in two cylinders is different. How far diameters are \nresponsible for change in levels in two cylinders? Empty cylinder (2) is an indicator of no product \nin it at the beginning.

If we start with equal initial concentration of H2 and I2, the reaction proceeds in the forward direction and the concentration of H2 and I2 decreases while that of HI increases, until all of these \nbecome constant at equilibrium (Fig. 6.5). We \ncan also start with HI alone and make the \nreaction to proceed in the reverse direction; \nthe concentration of HI will decrease and \nconcentration of H2 and I2 will increase until they all become constant when equilibrium is \nreached (Fig. 6.5).  If total number of H and I \natoms are same in a given volume, the same \nequilibrium mixture is obtained whether we \nstart it from pure reactants or pure product.equilibrium is attained, these two mixtures  (H2, N2, NH3 and D2, N2, ND3) are mixed together and left for a while.  Later, when this mixture is analysed, it is found that the \nconcentration of ammonia is just the same \nas before. However, when this mixture is \nanalysed by a mass spectrometer, it is found \nthat ammonia and all deuterium containing \nforms of ammonia (NH3, NH2D, NHD2 and ND3) and dihydrogen and its deutrated forms  (H2, HD and D2) are present. Thus one can conclude that scrambling of H and D atoms in \nthe molecules must result from a continuation \nof the forward and reverse reactions in the \nmixture. If the reaction had simply stopped \nwhen they reached equilibrium, then there \nwould have been no mixing of isotopes in \nthis way.Use of isotope (deuterium) in the formation of ammonia clearly indicates that chemical \nreactions reach a state of dynamic \nequilibrium in which the rates of forward \nand reverse reactions are equal and there \nis no net change in composition.  Equilibrium can be attained from both sides, whether we start reaction by taking, \nH2(g) and N2(g) and get NH3(g) or by taking NH3(g) and decomposing it into N2(g) and H2(g).N2(g) + 3H2(g)  2NH3(g)  Fig. 6.5  Chemical equilibrium in the reaction H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g) can be attained from either directionFig. 6.4 Depiction of equilibrium for the reaction6.3 LAW OF CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM AND EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTA mixture of reactants and products in the equilibrium state is called an equilibrium \nmixture. In this section we shall address a number of important questions about the \ncomposition of equilibrium mixtures: What is \nthe relationship between the concentrations \nof reactants and products in an equilibrium \nmixture? How can we determine equilibrium \nconcentrations from initial concentrations? \nWhat factors can be exploited to alter the NgHgNHg22332\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001f\u001e\u001f\u001eUnit 6.indd   1749/12/2022   11:58:21 AM175composition of an equilibrium mixture? The last question in particular is important when \nchoosing conditions for synthesis of industrial \nchemicals such as H2, NH3, CaO etc.To answer these questions, let us consider a general reversible reaction:A + B  C + Dwhere A and B are the reactants, C and D \nare the products in the balanced chemical \nequation. On the basis of experimental studies \nof many reversible reactions, the Norwegian \nchemists Cato Maximillian Guldberg and \nPeter Waage proposed in 1864 that the \nconcentrations in an equilibrium mixture \nare related by the following equilibrium \nequation,  Kc\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001dCDAB                (6.1)  (6.1) where Kc is the equilibrium constant and the expression on the right side is called the \nequilibrium constant expression.The equilibrium equation is also known as the law of mass action because in the early days of chemistry, concentration was called \n“active mass”. In order to appreciate their \nwork better, let us consider reaction between \ngaseous H2 and I2 carried out in a sealed vessel at 731K. H2(g)   +   I2(g)   2HI(g) 1 mol    1 mol          2 molSix sets of experiments with varying initial conditions were performed, starting with only gaseous H2 and I2 in a sealed reaction vessel in first four experiments (1, 2, 3 and 4) and \nonly HI in other two experiments (5 and 6). \nExperiment 1, 2, 3 and 4 were performed \ntaking different concentrations of H2 and / or I2, and with time it was observed that intensity of the purple colour remained constant and \nequilibrium was attained. Similarly, for \nexperiments 5 and 6, the equilibrium was \nattained from the opposite direction.Data obtained from all six sets of experiments are given in Table 6.2.It is evident from the experiments 1, 2, 3 and 4 that number of moles of dihydrogen \nreacted = number of moles of iodine reacted \n= ½ (number of moles of HI formed). Also, \nexperiments 5 and 6 indicate that,[H2(g)]eq = [I2(g)]eqKnowing the above facts, in order to establish a relationship between \nconcentrations of the reactants and products, \nseveral combinations can be tried. Let us \nconsider the simple expression,[HI(g)]eq / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eqIt can be seen from Table 6.3 that if we put the equilibrium concentrations of the \nreactants and products, the above expression Table 6.2  Initial and Equilibrium Concentrations of H2, I2 and HIUnit 6.indd   1759/12/2022   11:58:21 AM176is far from  constant. However, if we consider the expression,[HI(g)]2eq / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eqwe find that this expression gives constant \nvalue (as shown in Table 6.3) in all the six \ncases. It can be seen that in this expression \nthe power of the concentration for reactants \nand products are actually the stoichiometric �coefficients in the equation for the chemical \nreaction. Thus, for the reaction H2(g) + I2(g)   2HI(g), following equation 6.1, the equilibrium \nconstant Kc is written as,Kc  = [HI(g)]eq2 / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eq                   (6.2)Generally the subscript ‘eq’ (used for equilibrium) is omitted from the concentration \nterms. It is taken for granted that the \nconcentrations in the expression for Kc are equilibrium values. We, therefore, write,Kc  = [HI(g)]2 / [H2(g)] [I2(g)]                 (6.3)The subscript ‘c’ indicates that Kc is expressed in concentrations of mol L–1. At a given temperature, the product of concentrations of the reaction products \nraised to the respective stoichiometric \ncoefficient in the balanced chemical \nequation divided by the product of \nconcentrations of the reactants raised to �their individual stoichiometric coefficients \nhas a constant value. This is known as the Equilibrium Law or Law of Chemical Equilibrium.The equilibrium constant for a general reaction,a A   +  b B  c C  +  d Dis expressed as,Kc  = [C]c[D]d / [A]a[B]b                                       (6.4)where [A], [B], [C] and [D] are the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products.Equilibrium constant for the reaction,4NH3(g) + 5O2(g)  4NO(g) + 6H2O(g) is written as Kc  = [NO]4[H2O]6 / [NH3]4 [O2]5  Molar concentration of different species is indicated by enclosing these in square bracket and, as mentioned above, it is implied that \nthese are equilibrium concentrations. While \nwriting expression for equilibrium constant, \nsymbol for phases (s, l, g) are generally ignored. Let us write equilibrium constant for the reaction, H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g)               (6.5)as,  Kc = [HI]2 / [H2] [I2] = x                (6.6)The equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction, 2HI(g)  H2(g) + I2(g), at the same temperature is,K′c = [H2] [I2] / [HI]2 = 1/ x = 1 / Kc                (6.7)Thus, K′c = 1 / Kc                                                    (6.8)Equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction is the inverse of the equilibrium constant for the reaction in the forward \ndirection.If we change the stoichiometric coefficients in a chemical equation by multiplying \nthroughout by a factor then we must make \nsure that the expression for equilibrium \nconstant also reflects that change. For \nexample, if the  reaction (6.5) is written as,½ H2(g) + ½ I2(g)  HI(g)                   (6.9)the equilibrium constant for the above reaction is given byK″c   =  [HI] / [H2]1/2[I2]1/2 = {[HI]2 / [H2][I2]}1/2                                 = x1/2 = Kc1/2 (6.10)On multiplying the equation (6.5) by n, we getTable 6.3 Expression Involving the Equilibrium Concentration of Reactants H2(g) + I2(g)       2HI(g)Unit 6.indd   1769/12/2022   11:58:22 AM177nH2(g) +  nI2(g) D  2nHI(g)                 (6.11)Therefore, equilibrium constant for the reaction is equal to Kc n. These findings are summarised in Table 6.4. It should be noted that because the equilibrium constants Kc  and K′c have different numerical values, it is important to specify the form of the balanced \nchemical equation when quoting the value of \nan equilibrium constant.N2(g) + O2(g)  2NO(g)SolutionFor the reaction equilibrium constant, Kc can be written as,Kc = NO= 2.810M–322223330104210NOMM..=  0.622Problem 6.1The following concentrations were obtained for the formation of NH3 from N2 and H2 at equilibrium at 500K.

We shall now consider equilibrium constant for some \nhomogeneous reactions.6.4.1 Equilibrium Constant in Gaseous SystemsSo far we have expressed equilibrium constant of the reactions in terms of molar �concentration of the reactants and products, �and used symbol, Kc for it. For reactions involving gases, however, it is usually more \nconvenient to express the equilibrium \nconstant in terms of partial pressure.The ideal gas equation is written as,pV = nRT ⇒pnVT=RHere, p is the pressure in Pa, n is the number of moles of the gas, V is the volume in m3 and T is the temperature in Kelvin178Therefore, n/V is concentration expressed  in mol/m3If concentration c, is in mol/L or mol/dm3, and p is in bar thenp = cRT,\nWe can also write p = [gas]RT.Here, R= 0.0831 bar litre/mol KAt constant temperature, the pressure of the gas is proportional to its concentration i.e.,\np ∝ [gas]\nFor reaction in equilibrium     H2(g) +  I2(g)    2HI(g)We can write eitherKcHIgHgIg = ()\n()()222orKpppcHIHI = ()()()222                             (6.12)Further, since  pT                         pHIIHIgR=()\n\n22222=()\n\n=()IgRHgRHT                        pTTherefore, KpppTTp=()()()()\n[]()\n\n()\n\nHIHIggg2222222 = HIRHRI.RRT = HIHIggg()\n\n()()=222Kc             (6.13)In this example, Kp = Kc i.e., both equilibrium constants are equal.

The equilibrium between water vapour and \nliquid water in a closed container is an \nexample of heterogeneous equilibrium.H2O(l)  H2O(g)In this example, there is a gas phase and a liquid phase. In the same way, equilibrium \nbetween a solid and its saturated solution,Ca(OH)2 (s) + (aq)  Ca2+ (aq) + 2OH–(aq)is a heterogeneous equilibrium.Heterogeneous equilibria often involve pure solids or liquids. We can simplify equilibrium expressions for the heterogeneous \nequilibria involving a pure liquid or a pure \nsolid, as the molar concentration of a pure \nsolid or liquid is constant (i.e., independent \nof the amount present). In other words if a \nsubstance ‘X’ is involved, then [X(s)] and [X(l)] \nare constant, whatever the amount of ‘X’ is \ntaken. Contrary to this, [X(g)] and [X(aq)] will Unit 6.indd   1799/12/2022   11:58:24 AM180vary as the amount of X in a given volume varies. Let us take thermal dissociation of \ncalcium carbonate which is an interesting and \nimportant example of heterogeneous chemical \nequilibrium.CaCO3 (s)   CaO (s) + CO2 (g)     (6.16)On the basis of the stoichiometric equation, we can write,Kc\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\n\u0019\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\n\u0019\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019CaOsCOgCaCOs23Since [CaCO3(s)] and [CaO(s)] are both constant, therefore modified equilibrium constant for the thermal decomposition of \ncalcium carbonate will beK´c = [CO2(g)]                                  (6.17) or Kp = pCO2                                                           (6.18)This shows that at a particular temperature, there is a constant concentration \nor pressure of CO2 in equilibrium with CaO(s) and CaCO3(s). Experimentally it has been found that at 1100 K, the pressure of CO2 in equilibrium with CaCO3(s) and CaO(s), is  2.0 ×105 Pa. Therefore, equilibrium constant at 1100K for the above reaction is:Kp = PCO2 = 2 × 105 Pa/105 Pa = 2.00Similarly, in the equilibrium between nickel, carbon monoxide and nickel carbonyl �(used in the purification of nickel),Ni (s) + 4 CO (g)   Ni(CO)4 (g),the equilibrium constant is written asKc\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\n\u0019\u0018\u0017NiCOCO44It must be remembered that for the existence of heterogeneous equilibrium pure solids or liquids must also be present (however \nsmall the amount may be) at equilibrium, but \ntheir concentrations or partial pressures do \nnot appear in the expression of the equilibrium \nconstant. In the reaction,\nAg2O(s) + 2HNO3(aq)  2AgNO3(aq) +H2O(l)Kc = AgNO3\u001f\u001e\u001f\u001e\u0018\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001b\u001aUnits of Equilibrium ConstantThe value of equilibrium constant Kc can be calculated by substituting the concentration \nterms in mol/L and for Kp partial pressure is substituted in Pa, kPa, bar or atm. This \nresults in units of equilibrium constant based \non molarity or pressure, unless the exponents \nof both the numerator and denominator are \nsame.For the reactions,H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI, Kc and Kp have no unit.N2O4(g)  2NO2 (g), Kc has unit mol/L and Kp has unit barEquilibrium constants can also be expressed as dimensionless quantities if the standard state of reactants and products �are specified. For a pure gas, the standard \nstate is 1bar. Therefore a pressure of 4 bar \nin standard state can be expressed as 4 \nbar/1 bar = 4, which is a dimensionless \nnumber. Standard state (c0) for a solute is 1 molar solution and all concentrations can be \nmeasured with respect to it. The numerical \nvalue of equilibrium constant depends on the \nstandard state chosen. Thus, in this system \nboth Kp and Kc are dimensionless quantities but have different numerical values due to \ndifferent standard states. Problem 6.6The value of Kp for the reaction, CO2 (g) + C (s)  2CO (g)is 3.0 at 1000 K. If initially PCO2 = 0.48 bar and PCO = 0 bar and pure graphite is present, calculate the equilibrium partial pressures of CO and CO2.SolutionFor the reaction,\nlet ‘x’ be the decrease in pressure of CO2, then           CO2(g)  +  C(s)  2CO(g)Initial    pressure: 0.48 bar          0Unit 6.indd   1809/12/2022   11:58:24 AM181At equilibrium:             (0.48 – x)bar             2x barKp=ppCOCO22Kp = (2x)2/(0.48 – x) = 34x2 = 3(0.48 – x)4x2 = 1.44 – x4x2 + 3x – 1.44 = 0a = 4, b = 3, c = –1.44xbbaca\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001c\u001b242= [–3 ± √(3)2– 4(4)(–1.44)]/2 × 4=  (–3 ± 5.66)/8= (–3 + 5.66)/8 (as value of x cannot be negative hence we neglect that value)x = 2.66/8 = 0.33\nThe equilibrium partial pressures are,\npCO2= 2x = 2 × 0.33 = 0.66 barpCO2= 0.48 – x = 0.48 – 0.33 = 0.15 bar5. The equilibrium constant K for a reaction is related to the equilibrium constant of the corresponding reaction, whose \nequation is obtained by multiplying or \ndividing the equation for the original \nreaction by a small integer.Let us consider applications of equilibrium constant to:•\tpredict the extent of a reaction on the basis of its magnitude,•\tpredict the direction of the reaction, and•\tcalculate equilibrium concentrations.6.6.1 Predicting the Extent of a ReactionThe numerical value of the equilibrium constant for a reaction indicates the extent \nof the reaction. But it is important to note \nthat an equilibrium constant does not give \nany information about the rate at which \nthe equilibrium is reached. The magnitude \nof Kc or Kp is directly proportional to the concentrations of products (as these appear \nin the numerator of equilibrium constant \nexpression) and inversely proportional to the \nconcentrations of the reactants (these appear \nin the denominator). This implies that a high \nvalue of K is suggestive of a high concentration of products and vice-versa.We can make the following generalisations concerning the composition of equilibrium \nmixtures:•\tIf Kc \u003e 103, products predominate over reactants, i.e., if Kc is very large, the reaction proceeds nearly to completion. \nConsider the following examples:(a)  The reaction of H2 with O2 at 500 K has a very large equilibrium constant,  Kc = 2.4 × 1047.(b)  H2(g) + Cl2(g)  2HCl(g) at 300K has  Kc = 4.0 × 1031. (c) H2(g) + Br2(g)  2HBr (g) at 300 K,  Kc = 5.4 × 1018•\tIf Kc \u003c 10–3, reactants predominate over products, i.e., if Kc is very small, the reaction proceeds rarely. Consider the \nfollowing examples:6.6 APPLICATIONS OF EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTSBefore considering the applications of \nequilibrium constants, let us summarise the important features of equilibrium constants \nas follows:1. Expression for equilibrium constant is applicable only when concentrations of \nthe reactants and products have attained constant value at equilibrium state.2. The value of equilibrium constant is \nindependent of initial concentrations of \nthe reactants and products.3. Equilibrium constant is temperature dependent having one unique value for a particular reaction represented by a \nbalanced equation at a given temperature.4. The equilibrium constant for the reverse \nreaction is equal to the inverse of the \nequilibrium constant for the forward reaction.Unit 6.indd   1819/12/2022   11:58:24 AM182(a)  The decomposition of H2O into H2 and O2 at 500 K has a very small equilibrium constant, Kc = 4.1 × 10–48(b) N2(g)  +  O2(g)  2NO(g),  at 298 K has Kc = 4.8 ×10–31.•\tIf Kc is in the range of 10–3 to 103, appreciable concentrations of both reactants and products are present. \nConsider the following examples:(a)  For reaction of H2 with I2 to give HI,  Kc = 57.0 at 700K.(b)  Also, gas phase decomposition of N2O4 to NO2 is another reaction with a value of Kc = 4.64 × 10–3 at 25°C which is neither too small nor too large. Hence, \nequilibrium mixtures contain appreciable \nconcentrations of both N2O4 and NO2. These generarlisations are illustrated in \nFig. 6.6If Qc = Kc, the reaction mixture is already at equilibrium.Consider the gaseous reaction of H2  with I2,H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g); Kc = 57.0 at 700 K.Suppose we have molar concentrations [H2]t=0.10M, [I2]t = 0.20 M and [HI]t = 0.40 M.(the subscript t on the concentration symbols \nmeans that the concentrations were measured \nat some arbitrary time t, not necessarily at \nequilibrium). Thus, the reaction quotient, Qc at this stage of the reaction is given by,\nQc = [HI]t2 / [H2]t [I2]t  = (0.40)2/ (0.10)×(0.20)                            = 8.0Now, in this case, Qc (8.0) does not equal Kc (57.0), so the mixture of H2(g), I2(g) and HI(g) is not at equilibrium; that is, more H2(g) and I2(g) will react to form more HI(g) and their concentrations will decrease till Qc = Kc.The reaction quotient, Qc is useful in predicting the direction of reaction by comparing the values of Qc and Kc.Thus, we can make the following generalisations concerning the direction of the reaction (Fig. 6.7) :Fig.6.6 Dependence of extent of reaction on Kc 6.6.2 Predicting the Direction of the ReactionThe equilibrium constant helps in predicting the direction in which a given reaction will proceed at any stage. For this purpose, \nwe calculate the reaction quotient Q. The reaction quotient, Q (Qc with molar concentrations and QP with partial pressures) is defined in the same way as the equilibrium \nconstant Kc except that the concentrations in Qc are not necessarily equilibrium values.  For a general reaction:a A + b B    c C + d D        (6.19)Qc = [C]c[D]d / [A]a[B]b                  (6.20)Then, If Qc \u003e Kc, the reaction will proceed in the direction of reactants (reverse reaction).If Qc \u003c Kc, the reaction will proceed in the direction of the products (forward reaction).Fig. 6.7  Predicting the direction of the reaction•\tIf Qc \u003c Kc, net reaction goes from left to right•\tIf Qc \u003e Kc, net reaction goes from right to left.•\tIf Qc = Kc, no net reaction occurs.Problem 6.7The value of Kc for the reaction2A  B + C is 2 × 10–3.

Write the balanced equation for the reaction.Step 2. Under the balanced equation, make a table that lists for each substance involved in the reaction:(a) the initial concentration,(b) the change in concentration on going to equilibrium, and(c) the equilibrium concentration.In constructing the table, define x as the concentration (mol/L) of one of the substances that reacts on going to equilibrium, then use \nthe stoichiometry of the reaction to determine \nthe concentrations of the other substances in \nterms of x.Step 3. Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium equation for the reaction and solve for x. If you are \nto solve a quadratic equation choose the \nmathematical solution that makes chemical \nsense.Step 4. Calculate the equilibrium concentrations from the calculated value of x.Step 5. Check your results by substituting them into the equilibrium equation.Problem 6.813.8g of N2O4 was placed in a 1L reaction vessel at 400K and allowed to attain equilibriumN2O4 (g) 2NO2 (g)Unit 6.indd   1839/12/2022   11:58:25 AM184Let x mol per litre of PCl5 be dissociated,At equilibrium:    (3-x)      x       xKc = [PCl3][Cl2]/[PCl5]1.8 = x2/ (3 – x)x2 + 1.8x – 5.4 = 0x = [–1.8 ± √(1.8)2 – 4(–5.4)]/2x = [–1.8 ± √3.24 + 21.6]/2x = [–1.8 ± 4.98]/2x = [–1.8 + 4.98]/2 = 1.59\n[PCl5] = 3.0 – x = 3 –1.59 = 1.41 M[PCl3] = [Cl2] = x = 1.59 MTaking antilog of both sides, we get,  K = e–∆G/RT                 (6.23)Hence, using the equation (6.23), the reaction spontaneity can be interpreted in terms of the value of ∆G .•\tIf ∆G  \u003c 0, then –∆G /RT is positive, and e –∆DG /RT\u003e1, making K \u003e1, which implies a spontaneous reaction or the reaction which proceeds in the forward \ndirection to such an extent that the products are present predominantly.•\tIf ∆G  \u003e 0, then –∆G /RT is negative, and  e –∆G \u003c/RT 1, that is , K \u003c 1, which implies a non-spontaneous reaction or a reaction \nwhich proceeds in the forward direction \nto such a small degree that only a very \nminute quantity of product is formed.Problem 6.10The value of ∆G  for the phosphorylation of glucose in glycolysis is 13.8 kJ/mol.

However, as you have studied in Unit 5, it is directly related  to the thermodynamics of the reaction and  in particular, to the change in Gibbs energy, �∆G. If,•\t∆G is negative, then the reaction is spontaneous and proceeds in the forward direction.•\t∆G is positive, then reaction is considered \nnon-spontaneous. Instead, as reverse \nreaction would have a negative ∆G, the products of the forward reaction shall be \nconverted to the reactants.•\t∆G is 0, reaction has achieved equilibrium; at this point, there is no longer any free \nenergy left to drive the reaction.A mathematical expression of this thermodynamic view of equilibrium can be described by the following equation:∆G  = ∆G + RT lnQ                                    (6.21)where, G is standard Gibbs energy. At equilibrium, when ∆G = 0 and Q = Kc, the equation (6.21) becomes,∆G = ∆G + RT ln K = 0∆G = – RT lnK                                      (6.22)lnK = – ∆G / RTUnit 6.indd   1849/12/2022   11:58:25 AM185Fig. 6.8 Effect of addition of H2 on change of concentration for the reactants and products in the reaction,  H2(g) + I2 (g)  2HI(g)reactants to products while minimising the expenditure of energy. This implies maximum \nyield of products at mild temperature and \npressure conditions. If it does not happen, \nthen the experimental conditions need to be \nadjusted. For example, in the Haber process \nfor the synthesis of ammonia from N2 and H2, the choice of experimental conditions is of real economic importance. Annual world  \nproduction of ammonia is about hundred \nmillion tones, primarily for use as fertilisers.Equilibrium constant, Kc is independent of initial concentrations. But if a system at \nequilibrium is subjected to a change in the \nconcentration of one or more of the reacting \nsubstances, then the system is no longer at \nequilibrium; and net reaction takes place in \nsome direction until the system returns to \nequilibrium once again. Similarly, a change \nin temperature or pressure of the system may \nalso alter the equilibrium. In order to decide \nwhat course the reaction adopts and make \na qualitative prediction about the effect of a \nchange in conditions on equilibrium we use \nLe Chatelier’s principle. It states that a \nchange in any of the factors that determine \nthe equilibrium conditions of a system \nwill cause the system to change in such a \nmanner so as to reduce or to counteract \nthe effect of the change. This is applicable \nto all physical and chemical equilibria. We shall now be discussing factors which can influence the equilibrium.6.8.1 Effect of Concentration ChangeIn general, when equilibrium is disturbed by the addition/removal of any reactant/products, Le Chatelier’s principle predicts \nthat:• The concentration stress of an added reactant/product is relieved by net reaction in the direction that consumes the added substance.• The concentration stress of a removed \nreactant/product is relieved by net \nreaction in the direction that replenishes the removed substance. or in other words, “When the concentration of any of the reactants or products in a reaction at equilibrium is changed, the composition of the equilibrium mixture changes so as \nto minimize the effect of concentration \nchanges”. Let us take the reaction,H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g)If H2 is added to the reaction mixture at equilibrium, then the equilibrium of the reaction is disturbed. In order to restore it, \nthe reaction proceeds in a direction wherein \nH2 is consumed, i.e.,  more of H2 and I2 react to form HI and finally the equilibrium shifts \nin right (forward) direction (Fig.6.8). This is in \naccordance with the Le Chatelier’s principle \nwhich implies that in case of addition of a \nreactant/product, a new equilibrium will \nbe set up in which the concentration of the \nreactant/product should be less than what it \nwas after the addition but more than what it \nwas in the original mixture.The same point can be explained in terms of the reaction quotient, Qc,Qc = [HI]2/ [H2][I2]Unit 6.indd   18511/30/2022   15:48:33186Addition of hydrogen at equilibrium results in value of Qc being less than Kc . Thus, in order to attain equilibrium again reaction moves in the forward direction. Similarly, \nwe can say that removal of a product also \nboosts the forward reaction and increases \nthe concentration of the products and this \nhas great commercial application in cases \nof reactions, where the product is a gas or a \nvolatile substance. In case of manufacture of �ammonia, ammonia is liquified and removed \nfrom the reaction mixture so that reaction \nkeeps moving in forward direction. Similarly, \nin the large scale production of CaO (used \nas important building material) from CaCO3, constant removal of CO2 from the kiln drives the reaction to completion. It should be \nremembered that continuous removal of a \nproduct maintains Qc at a value less than Kc and reaction continues to move in the forward \ndirection.Effect of Concentration – An experimentThis can be demonstrated by the following reaction: Fe3+(aq)+ SCN–(aq)  [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)        (6.24)yellow      colourless      deep red        (6.25)A reddish colour appears on adding two drops of 0.002 M potassium thiocynate solution to 1 mL of 0.2 M iron(III) nitrate solution due to the formation of [Fe(SCN)]2+. The intensity of the red colour becomes constant on \nattaining equilibrium. This equilibrium can be \nshifted in either forward or reverse directions \ndepending on our choice of adding a reactant \nor a product. The equilibrium can be shifted \nin the opposite direction by adding reagents \nthat remove Fe3+ or SCN– ions. For example, oxalic acid (H2C2O4), reacts with Fe3+ ions to form the stable complex ion [Fe(C2O4)3]3–, thus decreasing the concentration of free \nFe3+(aq). In accordance with the Le Chatelier’s principle, the concentration stress of removed \nFe3+ is relieved by dissociation of [Fe(SCN)]2+ to replenish the Fe3+ ions. Because the concentration of [Fe(SCN)]2+ decreases, the intensity of red colour decreases.Addition of aq. HgCl2 also decreases red colour because Hg2+ reacts with SCN– ions to form stable complex ion [Hg(SCN)4]2–. Removal of free SCN– (aq) shifts the equilibrium in equation (6.24) from right to left to replenish SCN– ions.  Addition of potassium thiocyanate on the other hand increases the \ncolour intensity of the solution as it shift the \nequilibrium to right.6.8.2 Effect of Pressure ChangeA pressure change obtained by changing the volume can affect the yield of products in \ncase of a gaseous reaction where the total number of moles of gaseous reactants and \ntotal number of moles of gaseous products are \ndifferent. In applying Le Chatelier’s principle \nto a heterogeneous equilibrium the effect \nof pressure changes on solids and liquids \ncan be ignored because the volume (and \nconcentration) of a solution/liquid is nearly \nindependent of pressure.Consider the reaction,CO(g) + 3H2(g)  CH4(g) + H2O(g)Here, 4 mol of gaseous reactants (CO + 3H2) become 2 mol of gaseous products (CH4 + H2O). Suppose equilibrium mixture (for above reaction) kept in a cylinder fitted with a piston at constant temperature is compressed to \none half of its original volume. Then, total \npressure will be doubled (according to  pV = constant). The partial pressure and \ntherefore, concentration of reactants and \nproducts have changed and the mixture is no \nlonger at equilibrium. The direction in which \nthe reaction goes to re-establish equilibrium \ncan be predicted by applying the Le Chatelier’s \nprinciple. Since pressure has doubled, \nthe equilibrium now shifts in the forward \ndirection, a direction in which the number \nof moles of the gas or pressure decreases (we \nknow pressure is proportional to moles of the \ngas). This can also be understood by using \nreaction quotient, Qc. Let [CO], [H2], [CH4] and [H2O] be the molar concentrations at equilibrium for methanation reaction. When volume of the reaction mixture is halved, the Unit 6.indd   1869/12/2022   11:58:25 AM187Fig. 6.9 Effect of temperature on equilibrium for the reaction, 2NO2 (g)  N2O4 (g)partial pressure and the concentration are doubled. We obtain the reaction quotient by \nreplacing each equilibrium concentration by double its value.Qc=()\n()\n\n()()CHgHOgCOgHg4223As Qc \u003c Kc , the reaction proceeds in the forward direction.In reaction C(s) + CO2(g)  2CO(g), when pressure is increased, the reaction goes in the reverse direction because the number of moles \nof gas increases in the forward direction.6.8.3 Effect of Inert Gas AdditionIf the volume is kept constant and an inert gas such as argon is added which does not take \npart in the reaction, the equilibrium remains \nundisturbed. It is because the addition of an inert gas at constant volume does not \nchange the partial pressures or the molar \nconcentrations of the substance involved in \nthe reaction. The reaction quotient changes \nonly if the added gas is a reactant or product \ninvolved in the reaction.6.8.4 Effect of Temperature ChangeWhenever an equilibrium is disturbed by a change in the concentration, pressure or \nvolume, the composition of the equilibrium mixture changes because the reaction \nquotient, Qc no longer equals the equilibrium constant, Kc. However, when a change in temperature occurs, the value of equilibrium \nconstant, Kc  is changed.In general, the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant depends on the sign of ∆H for the reaction.•\tThe equilibrium constant for an exothermic reaction (negative ∆H) decreases as the temperature increases.•\tThe equilibrium constant for an \nendothermic reaction (positive ∆H) increases as the temperature increases.Temperature changes affect the equilibrium constant and rates of reactions. Production of ammonia according to the reaction,N2(g) + 3H2(g)  2NH3(g); ∆H= – 92.38 kJ mol–1is an exothermic process. According to  Le Chatelier’s principle, raising the temperature shifts the equilibrium to left \nand decreases the equilibrium concentration \nof ammonia. In other words, low temperature \nis favourable for high yield of ammonia, but \npractically very low temperatures slow down \nthe reaction and thus a catalyst is used.Effect of Temperature – An experimentEffect of temperature on equilibrium can be demonstrated by taking NO2 gas (brown in colour) which dimerises into N2O4 gas (colourless).2NO2(g)  N2O4(g); ∆H = –57.2 kJ mol–1NO2 gas prepared by addition of Cu turnings to conc. HNO3 is collected in two  5 mL test tubes (ensuring same intensity \nof colour of gas in each tube) and stopper \nsealed with araldite. Three 250 mL beakers \n1, 2 and 3 containing freesing mixture, water \nat room temperature and hot water (363K), \nrespectively, are taken (Fig. 6.9). Both the test \ntubes are placed in beaker 2 for 8-10 minutes. \nAfter this one is placed in beaker 1 and the \nother in beaker  3. The effect of temperature \non direction of reaction is depicted very well \nin this experiment. At low temperatures in \nbeaker 1, the forward reaction of formation of \nN2O4 is preferred, as reaction is exothermic, and thus, intensity of brown colour due \nto NO2 decreases. While in beaker 3, high temperature favours the reverse reaction of Unit 6.indd   18711/2/2022   4:11:28 PM188formation of NO2 and thus, the brown colour intensifies.Effect of temperature can also be seen in an endothermic reaction,[Co(H2O)6]3+(aq) + 4Cl–(aq)[CoCl4 ]2–(aq) +                                                                  6H2O(l) pink  colourless blueAt room temperature, the equilibrium mixture is blue due to [CoCl4]2–. When cooled in a freesing mixture, the colour of the mixture turns pink due to [Co(H2O)6]3+.6.8.5 Effect of a CatalystA catalyst increases the rate of the chemical reaction by making available a new low energy \npathway for the conversion of reactants to products. It increases the rate of forward \nand reverse reactions that pass through the \nsame transition state and does not affect \nequilibrium. Catalyst lowers the activation \nenergy for the forward and reverse reactions \nby exactly the same amount. Catalyst does \nnot affect the equilibrium composition of \na reaction mixture. It does not appear in \nthe balanced chemical equation or in the \nequilibrium constant expression.Let us consider the formation of NH3 from dinitrogen and dihydrogen which is \nhighly exothermic reaction and proceeds \nwith decrease in total number of moles \nformed as compared to the reactants. \nEquilibrium constant decreases with increase \nin temperature. At low temperature rate \ndecreases and it takes long time to reach at \nequilibrium, whereas high temperatures give satisfactory rates but poor yields. German chemist, Fritz Haber discovered that a catalyst consisting of iron catalyse the reaction to occur at a satisfactory rate \nat temperatures, where the equilibrium \nconcentration of NH3 is reasonably favourable. Since the number of moles formed in the \nreaction is less than those of reactants, the \nyield of NH3 can be improved by increasing the pressure.Optimum conditions of temperature and pressure for the synthesis of NH3 using catalyst are around 500°C and 200 atm.Similarly, in manufacture of sulphuric acid by contact process,2SO2(g) + O2(g)  2SO3(g);  Kc = 1.7 × 1026though the value of K is suggestive of reaction going to completion, but practically the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 is very slow. Thus, platinum or divanadium penta-oxide (V2O5) is used as catalyst to increase the rate of the \nreaction.Note: If a reaction has an exceedingly small K, a catalyst would be of little help.6.9 IONIC EQUILIBRIUM IN SOLUTIONUnder the effect of change of concentration on the direction of equilibrium, you have incidently come across with the following equilibrium which involves ions:Fe3+(aq) + SCN–(aq)  [Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)There are numerous equilibria that involve ions only. In the following sections we will study the equilibria involving ions. It is well \nknown that the aqueous solution of sugar \ndoes not conduct electricity. However, when \ncommon salt (sodium chloride) is added \nto water it conducts electricity. Also, the \nconductance of electricity increases with an \nincrease in concentration of common salt. �Michael Faraday classified the substances \ninto two categories based on their ability \nto conduct electricity. One category of \nsubstances conduct electricity in their \naqueous solutions and are called electrolytes while the other do not and are thus, referred to \nas non-electrolytes. Faraday further classified electrolytes into strong and weak electrolytes. Strong electrolytes on dissolution in water \nare ionized almost completely, while the weak \nelectrolytes are only partially dissociated.  For example, an aqueous solution of  sodium chloride is comprised entirely of sodium ions and chloride ions, while that  of acetic acid mainly contains unionized  acetic acid molecules and only some acetate \nions and hydronium ions. This is because  there is almost 100% ionization in case \nof sodium chloride as compared to less  than 5% ionization of acetic acid which is  a weak electrolyte. It should be noted  Unit 6.indd   18811/2/2022   4:11:28 PM189Fig.6.10 Dissolution of sodium chloride in water. Na+ and Cl– ions are stablised by their hydration with polar water molecules.that in weak electrolytes, equilibrium is established between ions and the unionized \nmolecules. This type of equilibrium involving \nions in aqueous solution is called ionic \nequilibrium. Acids, bases and salts come \nunder the category of electrolytes and may act \nas either strong or weak electrolytes.6.10 ACIDS, BASES AND SALTSAcids, bases and salts find widespread occurrence in nature. Hydrochloric acid present in the gastric juice is secreted by the �lining of our stomach in a significant amount \nof 1.2-1.5 L/day and is essential for digestive \n processes. Acetic acid is known to be the main \nconstituent of vinegar. Lemon and orange \njuices contain citric and ascorbic acids, and \ntartaric acid is found in tamarind paste. As \nmost of the acids taste sour, the word “acid” \nhas been derived from a latin word “acidus” \nmeaning sour. Acids are known to turn blue \nlitmus paper into red and liberate dihydrogen \non reacting with some metals. Similarly, bases \nare known to turn red litmus paper blue, taste \nbitter and feel soapy. A common example \nof a base is washing soda used for washing \npurposes. When acids and bases are mixed \nin the right proportion they react with each \nother to give salts. Some commonly known \nexamples of salts are sodium chloride, barium \nsulphate, sodium nitrate.  Sodium chloride \n(common salt) is an important component of \nour diet and is formed by reaction between \nhydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. It exists in solid state as a cluster of positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged \nchloride ions which are held together due to \nelectrostatic interactions between oppositely \ncharged species (Fig.6.10). The electrostatic \nforces between two charges are inversely \nproportional to dielectric constant of the \nmedium. Water, a universal solvent, possesses \na very high dielectric constant of 80. Thus, \nwhen sodium chloride is dissolved in water, \nthe electrostatic interactions are reduced by \na factor of 80 and this facilitates the ions to \nmove freely in the solution. Also, they are \nwell-separated due to hydration with water \nmolecules. Faraday was born near London into a family of very limited means. At the age of 14 he was an apprentice to a kind bookbinder who allowed Faraday to read the \nbooks he was binding. Through a fortunate chance he became laboratory assistant \nto Davy, and during 1813-4, Faraday accompanied him to the Continent.  During \nthis trip he gained much from the experience of coming into contact with many of the \nleading scientists of the time.  In 1825, he succeeded Davy as Director of the Royal �Institution\tlaboratories,\tand\tin\t1833\the\talso\tbecame\tthe\tfirst\tFullerian\tProfessor\tof\tChemistry.\tFaraday’s\tfirst\timportant\twork\twas\ton\tanalytical\tchemistry.\tAfter\t1821\tmuch of his work was on electricity and magnetism and different electromagnetic �phenomena.\tHis\tideas\thave\tled\tto\tthe\testablishment\tof\tmodern\tfield\ttheory.\t\tHe discovered his two laws of electrolysis in 1834.

The extent to which \nionization occurs depends upon the strength \nof the bond and the extent of solvation \nof ions produced. The terms dissociation \nand ionization have earlier been used with \ndifferent meaning. Dissociation refers to the \nprocess of separation of ions in water already \nexisting as such in the solid state of the solute, \nas in sodium chloride. On the other hand, \nionization corresponds to a process in which \na neutral molecule splits into charged ions in \nthe solution. Here, we shall not distinguish \nbetween the two and use the two terms \ninterchangeably. 6.10.1 Arrhenius Concept of Acids and BasesAccording to Arrhenius theory, acids are substances that dissociates in water to give hydrogen ions H+(aq) and bases are substances that produce hydroxyl ions OH–(aq). The ionization of an acid HX (aq) can be represented by the following equations:HX (aq) → H+(aq) + X– (aq)orHX(aq) + H2O(l) → H3O+(aq) + X –(aq)A bare proton, H+ is very reactive and cannot exist freely in aqueous solutions. Thus, it bonds to the oxygen atom of a solvent \nwater molecule to give trigonal pyramidal hydronium ion, H3O+ {[H (H2O)]+} (see box). In this chapter we shall use H+(aq) and H3O+(aq) interchangeably to mean the same i.e., a \nhydrated proton. Similarly, a base molecule like MOH ionizes in aqueous solution according to the \nequation:MOH(aq) → M+(aq) + OH–(aq)The hydroxyl ion also exists in the hydrated \nform in the aqueous solution. Arrhenius \nconcept of acid and base, however, suffers \nfrom the limitation of being applicable only to \naqueous solutions and also, does not account \nfor the basicity of substances like, ammonia \nwhich do not possess a hydroxyl group.6.10.2 The Brönsted-Lowry Acids and BasesThe Danish chemist, Johannes Brönsted and the English chemist, Thomas M. Lowry gave �a more general definition of acids and bases. According to Brönsted-Lowry theory, acid is a substance that is capable of donating a \nhydrogen ion H+ and bases are substances capable of accepting a hydrogen ion, H+. In short, acids are proton donors and bases are \nproton acceptors. Consider the example of dissolution of NH3 in H2O represented by the following equation:Hydronium and Hydroxyl IonsHydrogen ion by itself is a bare proton with very small size (~10–15 m radius) and intense electric field, binds itself with the water molecule at \none of the two available lone pairs on it giving \nH3O+. This species has been detected in many compounds (e.g., H3O+Cl–) in the solid state. In aqueous solution the hydronium ion is further \nhydrated to give species like H5O2+, H7O3+ and H9O4+. Similarly the hydroxyl ion is hydrated to give several ionic species like H3O2–, H5O3– and H7O4– etc.The basic solution is formed due to the presence of hydroxyl ions. In this reaction, water molecule acts as proton donor and \nammonia molecule acts as proton acceptor \nand are thus, called Lowry-Brönsted acid and H9O4+Unit 6.indd   1909/12/2022   11:58:26 AM191Arrhenius was born near Uppsala, Sweden. He presented his thesis, on the conductivities of electrolyte solutions, to the University of Uppsala in 1884.  For the �next\tfive\tyears\the\ttravelled\textensively\tand\tvisited\ta\tnumber\tof\tresearch\tcenters\tin Europe. In 1895 he was appointed professor of physics at the newly formed \nUniversity of Stockholm, serving its rector from 1897 to 1902.  From 1905 until his death he was Director of physical chemistry at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm.  He \ncontinued to work for many years on electrolytic solutions.  In 1899 he discussed \nthe temperature dependence of reaction rates on the basis of an equation, now \nusually known as Arrhenius equation.He worked in a variety of fields, and made important contributions to immunochemistry, cosmology, the origin of life, and the causes of ice age. He was �the\tfirst\tto\tdiscuss\tthe\t‘green\thouse\teffect’\tcalling\tby\tthat\tname.\tHe\treceived\tNobel\tPrize in Chemistry in 1903 for his theory of electrolytic dissociation and its use in the development of chemistry.base, respectively. In the reverse reaction, H+ is transferred from NH4+ to OH–. In this case, NH4+ acts as a Bronsted acid while OH– acted as a Brönsted base. The acid-base pair that differs only by one proton is called \na conjugate acid-base pair. Therefore, OH– is called the conjugate base of an acid H2O and NH4+ is called conjugate acid of the base NH3. If Brönsted acid is a strong acid then its conjugate base is a weak base and vice-versa. It may be noted that conjugate acid has one extra proton and each conjugate base \nhas one less proton.Consider the example of ionization of hydrochloric acid in water. HCl(aq) acts as \nan acid by donating a proton to H2O molecule which acts as a base.in case of ammonia it acts as an acid by \ndonating a proton.Problem 6.12What will be the conjugate bases for the following Brönsted acids: HF, H2SO4 and HCO3– ?SolutionThe conjugate bases should have one proton less in each case and therefore the \ncorresponding conjugate bases are: F–, HSO4– and CO32– respectively.Problem 6.13Write the conjugate acids for the following Brönsted bases: NH2–, NH3 and HCOO–.SolutionThe conjugate acid should have one extra proton in each case and therefore the \ncorresponding conjugate acids are: NH3, NH4+ and HCOOH respectively.Problem 6.14The species: H2O, HCO3–, HSO4– and NH3 can act both as Bronsted acids and bases. For each case give the corresponding conjugate \nacid and conjugate base.SolutionThe answer is given in the following Table:Species     Conjugate      Conjugate           acid          baseH2O   H3O+  OH–HCO3–   H2CO3  CO32–HSO4–   H2SO4  SO42–NH3   NH4+  NH2–Svante Arrhenius(1859-1927)It can be seen in the above equation, that water acts as a base because it accepts the proton. The species H3O+ is produced when water accepts a proton from HCl. Therefore, \nCl– is a conjugate base of HCl and HCl is the conjugate acid of base Cl–. Similarly, H2O is a conjugate base of an acid H3O+ and H3O+ is a conjugate acid of base H2O.It is interesting to observe the dual role of water as an acid and a base. In case of \nreaction with HCl water acts as a base while Unit 6.indd   1919/12/2022   11:58:26 AM1926.10.3 Lewis Acids and BasesG.N. Lewis in 1923 defined an acid as a species which accepts electron pair and base which donates an electron pair. As far as bases \nare concerned, there is not much difference \nbetween Brönsted-Lowry and Lewis concepts, \nas the base provides a lone pair in both the \ncases. However, in Lewis concept many \nacids do not have proton. A typical example �is reaction of electron deficient species BF3 with NH3.BF3 does not have a proton but still acts as an acid and reacts with NH3 by accepting its lone pair of electrons. The reaction can be \nrepresented by,BF3 + :NH3 → BF3:NH3Electron deficient species  like AlCl3, Co3+, Mg2+, etc.  can act as Lewis acids while species like H2O, NH3, OH– etc. which can donate a pair of electrons, can act as Lewis bases.Problem 6.15Classify the following species into Lewis acids and Lewis bases and show how these \nact as such:(a) HO– (b) F–       (c) H+  (d) BCl3Solution (a) Hydroxyl ion is a Lewis base as it can donate an electron lone pair (:OH– ).(b) Flouride ion acts as a Lewis base \nas it can donate any one of its four \nelectron lone pairs.(c) A proton is a Lewis acid as it can accept a lone pair of electrons from �bases like hydroxyl ion and fluoride \nion.(d)  BCl3 acts as a Lewis acid as it can accept a lone pair of electrons from \nspecies like ammonia or amine \nmolecules.6.11 IONIZATION OF ACIDS AND BASESArrhenius concept of acids and bases becomes useful in case of ionization of acids \nand bases as mostly ionizations in chemical \nand biological systems occur in aqueous \nmedium. Strong acids like perchloric acid (HClO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hyrdoiodic acid (HI), nitric acid \n(HNO3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) are termed strong because they are almost completely \ndissociated into their constituent ions in an \naqueous medium, thereby acting as proton \n(H+) donors. Similarly, strong bases like lithium hydroxide (LiOH), sodium hydroxide \n(NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), caesium \nhydroxide (CsOH) and barium hydroxide \nBa(OH)2 are almost completely dissociated into ions in an aqueous medium giving \nhydroxyl ions, OH–. According to Arrhenius concept they are strong acids and bases as \nthey are able to completely dissociate and \nproduce H3O+ and OH– ions respectively in the medium. Alternatively, the strength of an \nacid or base may also be gauged in terms of \nBrönsted-Lowry concept of acids and bases, \nwherein a strong acid means a good proton \ndonor and a strong base implies a good proton \nacceptor. Consider, the acid-base dissociation \nequilibrium of a weak acid HA,HA(aq)  +  H2O(l)   H3O+(aq)  +  A–(aq)                                     conjugate    conjugateacid         base              acid            baseIn section 6.10.2 we saw that acid (or base) dissociation equilibrium is dynamic involving a transfer of proton in forward and reverse directions. Now, the question arises \nthat if the equilibrium is dynamic then with \npassage of time which direction is favoured? \nWhat is the driving force behind it? In order \nto answer these questions we shall deal \ninto the issue of comparing the strengths \nof the two acids (or bases) involved in the \ndissociation equilibrium. Consider the two \nacids HA and H3O+ present in the above mentioned acid-dissociation equilibrium. \nWe have to see which amongst them is a \nstronger proton donor. Whichever exceeds \nin its tendency of donating a proton over the \nother shall be termed as the stronger acid \nand the equilibrium will shift in the direction \nof weaker acid. Say, if HA is a stronger acid \nthan H3O+, then HA will donate protons and not H3O+, and the solution will mainly contain A– and H3O+ ions. The equilibrium moves in the direction of formation of weaker acid Unit 6.indd   1929/12/2022   11:58:26 AM193and weaker base because the stronger acid donates a proton to the stronger base. It follows that as a strong acid dissociates completely in water, the resulting base formed \nwould be very weak i.e., strong acids have \nvery weak conjugate bases. Strong acids \nlike perchloric acid (HClO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hydroiodic acid \n(HI), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) will give conjugate base ions ClO4–, Cl, Br–, I–, NO3– and HSO4– , which are much weaker bases than H2O. Similarly a very strong base would give a very weak conjugate acid. On the \nother hand, a weak acid say HA is only partially \ndissociated in aqueous medium and thus, the \nsolution mainly contains undissociated HA \nmolecules. Typical weak acids are nitrous \nacid (HNO2), hydrofluoric acid (HF) and acetic acid (CH3COOH). It should be noted that the weak acids have very strong conjugate bases. \nFor example, NH2–, O2– and H– are very good proton acceptors and thus, much stronger \nbases than H2O. Certain water soluble organic compounds like phenolphthalein and bromothymol blue \nbehave as weak acids and exhibit different \ncolours in their acid (HIn) and conjugate base \n(In– ) forms.HIn(aq)  +   H2O(l)     H3O+(aq)   +   In–(aq)  acid    conjugate  conjugateindicator        acid           basecolour A               colour BSuch compounds are useful as indicators in acid-base titrations, and finding out H+ ion concentration.6.11.1 The Ionization Constant of Water and its Ionic ProductSome substances like water are unique in their ability of acting both as an acid and a base. We have seen this in case of water in \nsection 6.10.2. In presence of an acid, HA it \naccepts a proton and acts as the base while \nin the presence of a base, B– it acts as an acid by donating a proton. In pure water, one \nH2O molecule donates proton and acts as an acid and another water molecules accepts a \nproton and acts as a base at the same time.  The following equilibrium exists:H2O(l)  +  H2O(l)     H3O+(aq)  +   OH–(aq)acid        base         conjugate       conjugate                          acid                baseThe dissociation constant is represented by,K = [H3O+] [OH–] / [H2O]                    (6.26)The concentration of water is omitted from the denominator as water is a pure liquid and its concentration remains constant. [H2O] is incorporated within the equilibrium constant to give a new constant, Kw, which is called the ionic product of water.  Kw = [H+][OH–]            (6.27)The concentration of H+ has been found out experimentally as 1.0 × 10–7 M at 298 K. And, as dissociation of water produces equal \nnumber of H+ and OH– ions, the concentration of hydroxyl ions, [OH–] = [H+] = 1.0 × 10–7 M.  Thus, the value of Kw at 298K,Kw = [H3O+][OH–] = (1 × 10–7)2 = 1 × 10–14 M2 (6.28)The value of Kw is temperature dependent as it is an equilibrium constant.The density of pure water is 1000 g / L and its molar mass is 18.0 g /mol. From this \nthe molarity of pure water can be given as,[H2O] = (1000 g /L)(1 mol/18.0 g) = 55.55 M. Therefore, the ratio of dissociated water to that of undissociated water can be given as:10–7 / (55.55) = 1.8 × 10–9 or  ~ 2 in 10–9 (thus, equilibrium lies mainly towards undissociated water)We can distinguish acidic, neutral and basic aqueous solutions by the relative values of the H3O+ and OH– concentrations:Acidic: [H3O+] \u003e [OH– ]Neutral: [H3O+] = [OH– ]Basic : [H3O+] \u003c [OH–]6.11.2 The pH ScaleHydronium ion concentration in molarity is more conveniently expressed on a logarithmic scale known as the pH scale. The pH of a �solution is defined as the negative logarithm to base 10 of the activity aH\u001f\u001e\u001d of hydrogen Unit 6.indd   1939/12/2022   11:58:26 AM194ion. In dilute solutions (\u003c 0.01 M), activity of hydrogen ion (H+) is equal in magnitude to molarity represented by [H+]. It should  be noted that activity has no units and is defined as:  = [H+] / mol L–1From the definition of pH, the following can be written,pH = – log aH+ = – log {[H+] / mol L–1}Thus, an acidic solution of HCl (10–2 M) will have a pH = 2. Similarly, a basic solution of NaOH having [OH–] =10–4 M and [H3O+] =  10–10 M will have a pH = 10. At 25 °C, pure water has a concentration of hydrogen ions,  [H+] = 10–7 M. Hence, the pH of pure water is given as:pH = –log(10–7) = 7Acidic solutions possess a concentration of hydrogen ions, [H+] \u003e 10–7 M, while basic solutions possess a concentration of hydrogen \nions, [H+] \u003c 10–7 M. thus, we can summarise that\nAcidic solution has pH \u003c 7Basic solution has pH \u003e 7\nNeutral solution has pH = 7Now again, consider the equation (6.28) at 298 KKw = [H3O+] [OH–] = 10–14Taking negative logarithm on both sides of equation, we obtain–log Kw = – log {[H3O+] [OH–]}              = – log [H3O+] – log [OH–]             = – log 10–14   pKw  =   pH  +  pOH   =   14             (6.29)Note that although Kw may change with temperature the variations in pH with temperature are so small that we often  ignore it.pKw is a very important quantity for aqueous solutions and controls the relative concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxyl \nions as their product is a constant. It should \nbe noted that as the pH scale is logarithmic, \na change in pH by just one unit also means \nchange in [H+] by a factor of 10. Similarly, when the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+] changes by a factor of 100, the value of pH \nchanges by 2 units. Now you can realise why \nthe change in pH with temperature is often \nignored.Measurement of pH of a solution is very essential as its value should be known \nwhen dealing with biological and cosmetic \napplications. The pH of a solution can be \nfound roughly with the help of pH paper that \nhas different colour in solutions of different \npH. Now-a-days pH paper is available with \nfour strips on it. The different strips have \ndifferent colours (Fig. 6.11) at the same pH. \nThe pH in the range of 1-14 can be determined \nwith an accuracy of ~0.5 using pH paper. Fig.6.11 pH-paper with four strips that may have different colours at the same pHFor greater accuracy pH meters are used. pH meter is a device that measures the  pH-dependent electrical potential of the test solution within 0.001 precision. pH meters \nof the size of a writing pen are now available \nin the market. The pH of some very common \nsubstances are given in Table 6.5 (page 195).Problem 6.16The concentration of hydrogen ion in a sample of soft drink is 3.8 × 10–3M. what is its pH ?SolutionpH = – log[3.8 × 10–3]       = – {log[3.8] + log[10–3]}      = – {(0.58) + (– 3.0)} = – { – 2.42} = 2.42Therefore, the pH of the soft drink is 2.42 \nand it can be inferred that it is acidic.Problem 6.17  Calculate pH of a 1.0 × 10–8 M solution of HCl.Unit 6.indd   1949/12/2022   11:58:28 AM195Table 6.6 The Ionization Constants of Some Selected Weak Acids (at 298K) Acid Ionization Constant,   KaHydrofluoric Acid (HF) 3.5 × 10–4Nitrous Acid (HNO2) 4.5 × 10–4Formic Acid (HCOOH) 1.8 × 10–4Niacin (C5H4NCOOH) 1.5 × 10–5Acetic Acid (CH3COOH) 1.74 × 10–5Benzoic Acid (C6H5COOH) 6.5 × 10–5Hypochlorous Acid (HCIO) 3.0 × 10–8Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN) 4.9 × 10–10Phenol (C6H5OH) 1.3 × 10–10Solution    2H2O (l)   H3O+ (aq)  +  OH–(aq) Kw = [OH–][H3O+]      = 10–14Let, x = [OH–] = [H3O+] from H2O.  The H3O+ concentration is generated (i) from  the ionization of HCl dissolved i.e., HCl(aq)  + H2O(l)  H3O+ (aq)  +  Cl –(aq),  and (ii) from ionization of H2O. In these very dilute solutions, both sources of H3O+ must be considered:\n[H3O+] = 10–8 + xKw = (10–8 + x)(x) = 10–14 or x2 + 10–8 x – 10–14 = 0[OH– ] = x = 9.5 × 10–8So, pOH = 7.02 and pH = 6.986.11.3 Ionization Constants of Weak AcidsConsider a weak acid HX that is partially ionized in the aqueous solution. The equilibrium can be expressed by:HX(aq) + H2O(l)  H3O+(aq) + X–(aq)Initial concentration (M)\nc                                0               0\nLet α be the extent of ionization�Change (M) -cα                 +cα               +cαEquilibrium concentration (M) c-cα                  cα                cα Here, c = initial concentration of the undissociated acid, HX at time, t = 0. α = extent up to which HX is ionized into ions. Using these notations, we can derive the equilibrium constant for the above discussed �acid-dissociation equilibrium:Ka = c2α2 / c(1-α) = cα2 / 1-αKa is called the dissociation or ionization constant of acid HX. It can be represented alternatively in terms of molar concentration �as follows,   Ka = [H+][X–] / [HX]         (6.30)At a given temperature T, Ka is a measure of the strength of the acid HX i.e., \nlarger the value of Ka, the stronger is the acid. Ka is a dimensionless quantity with the understanding that the standard state \nconcentration of all species is 1M.The values of the ionization constants of some selected weak acids are given in  Table 6.6.Table 6.5  The pH of Some Common Substances Name of the Fluid pH Name of the Fluid pHSaturated solution of NaOH ~15 Black Coffee 5.00.1 M NaOH solution 13 Tomato juice ~4.2Lime water 10.5 Soft drinks and vinegar ~3.0Milk of magnesia 10 Lemon juice ~2.2 Egg white, sea water 7.8 Gastric juice ~1.2Human blood 7.4 1M HCl solution ~0Milk  6.8 Concentrated HCl ~–1.0Human Saliva 6.4 The pH scale for the hydrogen ion concentration has been so useful that besides \npKw, it has been extended to other species and Unit 6.indd   19511/2/2022   4:11:08 PM196quantities. Thus, we have:pKa = –log (Ka)                                   (6.31)Knowing the ionization constant, Ka of an acid and its initial concentration, c, it is possible to calculate the equilibrium �concentration of all species and also the degree of ionization of the acid and the pH of the solution.A general step-wise approach can be adopted to evaluate the pH of the weak �electrolyte as follows:Step 1. The species present before dissociation are identified as Brönsted-Lowry  acids/bases.Step 2. Balanced equations for all possible reactions i.e., with a species acting both as acid as well as base are written.Step 3. The reaction with the higher Ka is identified as the primary reaction whilst the other is a subsidiary reaction.Step 4.  Enlist in a tabular form the following values for each of the species in the primary \nreaction(a) Initial concentration, c.(b) Change in concentration on proceeding to equilibrium in terms of α, degree of ionization.(c) Equilibrium concentration.Step 5. Substitute equilibrium concentrations into equilibrium constant equation for �principal reaction and solve for α.Step 6.  Calculate the concentration of species \nin principal reaction.Step 7.  Calculate pH = – log[H3O+]The above mentioned methodology has been elucidated in the following examples.Solution The following proton transfer reactions are possible:1) HF + H2O  H3O+ + F–                                            Ka = 3.2 × 10–42) H2O + H2O  H3O+ + OH–                                         Kw = 1.0 × 10–14As Ka \u003e\u003e Kw, [1] is the principle reaction.

Also, determine the value of Ka and pKa of the monobasic acid. Solution    pH = – log [H+]Therefore, [H+] = 10 –pH = 10–4.50                                      = 3.16 × 10–5 [H+] = [A–] = 3.16 × 10–5Thus,   Ka = [H+][A-] / [HA] [HA]eqlbm = 0.1 – (3.16 × 10-5)   0.1Ka = (3.16 × 10–5)2 / 0.1 = 1.0 × 10–8pKa = – log(10–8) = 8Alternatively, “Percent dissociation” is \nanother useful method for measure of \nstrength of a weak acid and is given as:Percent dissociation \n= [HA]dissociated/[HA]initial × 100%            (6.32)Problem 6.20Calculate the pH of 0.08M solution of hypochlorous acid, HOCl.

The equilibrium constant for base ionization \nis called base ionization constant and is \nrepresented by Kb. It can be expressed in terms of concentration in molarity of various \nspecies in equilibrium by the following \nequation:Kb = [M+][OH–] / [MOH]         (6.33)Alternatively, if c = initial concentration of base and α = degree of ionization of base i.e. the extent to which the base ionizes. When equilibrium is reached, the equilibrium \nconstant can be written as:Kb = (cα)2 / c (1-α) = cα2 / (1-α)The values of the ionization constants of some selected weak bases, Kb are given in  Table 6.7.Many organic compounds like amines are weak bases. Amines are derivatives of ammonia in which one or more hydrogen \natoms are replaced by another group. For \nexample, methylamine, codeine, quinine and Unit 6.indd   1979/12/2022   11:58:28 AM198nicotine all behave as very weak bases due to their very small Kb. Ammonia produces OH– in aqueous solution:NH3(aq) + H2O(l)   NH4+(aq) + OH–(aq)The pH scale for the hydrogen ion concentration has been extended to get:pKb = –log (Kb)             (6.34)Problem 6.21 The pH of 0.004M hydrazine solution is 9.7. Calculate its ionization constant Kb and pKb.Solution NH2NH2  +  H2O   NH2NH3+   +   OH–From the pH we can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration. Knowing hydrogen ion \nconcentration and the ionic product of water we can calculate the concentration of hydroxyl ions. Thus we have:[H+] = antilog (–pH) =  antilog (–9.7) = 1.67 ×10–10[OH–] = Kw / [H+] = 1 × 10–14 / 1.67 × 10–10                   = 5.98 × 10–5The concentration of the corresponding hydrazinium ion is also the same as that \nof hydroxyl ion. The concentration of both \nthese ions is very small so the concentration \nof the undissociated base can be taken \nequal to 0.004M.Thus,\nKb = [NH2NH3+][OH–] / [NH2NH2] = (5.98 × 10–5)2 / 0.004 = 8.96 × 10–7pKb = –logKb = –log(8.96 × 10–7) = 6.04.Problem 6.22Calculate the pH of the solution in which  0.2M NH4Cl and 0.1M NH3 are present. The pKb of ammonia solution is 4.75.Solution   NH3   +   H2O        NH4+     +      OH–The ionization constant of NH3,         Kb = antilog (–pKb) i.e.Kb = 10–4.75 = 1.77 × 10–5 M         NH3   +   H2O       NH4+     +      OH–Initial concentration (M)        0.10        0.20         0Change to reach \nequilibrium (M) \n           –x                          +x                  +x\nAt equilibrium (M)     \n      0.10 – x                 0.20 + x             x\nKb = [NH4+][OH–] / [NH3] = (0.20 + x)(x) / (0.1 – x) = 1.77 × 10–5As Kb is small, we can neglect x in comparison to 0.1M and 0.2M. Thus,\n[OH–] = x = 0.88 × 10–5Therefore, [H+] = 1.12 × 10–9pH = – log[H+] = 8.95.6.11.5 Relation between Ka and KbAs seen earlier in this chapter, Ka and Kb represent the strength of an acid and a base, respectively. In case of a conjugate acid-base \npair, they are related in a simple manner so \nthat if one is known, the other can be deduced. \nConsidering the example of NH4+ and NH3  we see,NH4+(aq) + H2O(l)   H3O+(aq) + NH3(aq)  Ka = [H3O+][ NH3] / [NH4+] = 5.6 × 10–10NH3(aq) + H2O(l)    NH4+(aq) + OH–(aq)     Kb =[ NH4+][ OH–] / NH3 = 1.8 × 10–5Net: 2 H2O(l)    H3O+(aq) + OH–(aq)            Kw = [H3O+][ OH– ] = 1.0 × 10–14 MWhere, Ka represents the strength of NH4+ as an acid and Kb represents the strength of NH3 as a base.It can be seen from the net reaction that the equilibrium constant is equal to the product of equilibrium constants Ka and Kb for the reactions added. Thus,Ka × Kb = {[H3O+][ NH3] / [NH4+ ]} × {[NH4+]                                         [OH–] / [NH3]}= [H3O+][OH–] = Kw= (5.6 ×10–10) × (1.8 × 10–5) = 1.0 × 10–14 MUnit 6.indd   1989/12/2022   11:58:28 AM199This can be extended to make a generalisation. The equilibrium constant for a net reaction obtained after adding two (or more) reactions equals the product \nof the equilibrium constants for individual \nreactions:KNET = K1 × K2 × ……                                   (6.35)Similarly, in case of a conjugate acid-base pair,Ka × Kb = Kw                                                             (6.36)Knowing one, the other can be obtained. It should be noted that a strong acid will have \na weak conjugate base and vice-versa.Alternatively, the above expression  Kw = Ka × Kb, can also be obtained by considering the base-dissociation equilibrium \nreaction:B(aq) + H2O(l)         BH+(aq) + OH–(aq)Kb = [BH+][OH–] / [B] As the concentration of water remains constant it has been omitted from the \ndenominator and incorporated within the \ndissociation constant. Then multiplying and \ndividing the above expression by [H+], we get:Kb = [BH+][OH–][H+] / [B][H+]      ={[ OH–][H+]}{[BH+] / [B][H+]}    = Kw / Kaor  Ka × Kb = KwIt may be noted that if we take negative logarithm of both sides of the equation, then pK values of the conjugate acid and base are \nrelated to each other by the equation:pKa + pKb = pKw = 14 (at 298K)Problem 6.23 Determine the degree of ionization and pH of a 0.05M of ammonia solution. The ionization \nconstant of ammonia can be taken from \nTable 6.7. Also, calculate the ionization \nconstant of the conjugate acid of ammonia.Solution The ionization of NH3 in water is represented by equation:NH3  +  H2O           NH4+    +    OH–We use equation (6.33) to calculate hydroxyl ion concentration,[OH–] = c α = 0.05 α Kb = 0.05 α2 / (1 – α)The value of α is small, therefore the quadratic equation can be simplified by neglecting α in comparison to 1 in the denominator on right hand side of the \nequation,Thus,\nKb = c α2  or   α = √ (1.77 × 10–5 / 0.05)                 = 0.018.[OH–] = c α = 0.05 × 0.018 = 9.4 × 10–4M.[H+] = Kw / [OH–] = 10–14 / (9.4 × 10–4)                           = 1.06 × 10–11pH = –log(1.06 × 10–11) = 10.97.Now, using the relation for conjugate acid-base pair,Ka × Kb = Kwusing the value of Kb of NH3 from  Table 6.7.\nWe can determine the concentration of conjugate acid NH4+Ka = Kw / Kb = 10–14 / 1.77 × 10–5                     = 5.64 × 10–10.6.11.6 Di- and Polybasic Acids and Di- and Polyacidic BasesSome of the acids like oxalic acid, sulphuric \nacid and phosphoric acids have more than \none ionizable proton per molecule of the acid. Such acids are known as polybasic or \npolyprotic acids.The ionization reactions for example for a dibasic acid H2X are represented by the equations:H2X(aq)  H+(aq) + HX–(aq)HX–(aq)  H+(aq) + X2–(aq)And the corresponding equilibrium constants are given below:Ka1= {[H+][HX–]} / [H2X] andUnit 6.indd   1999/12/2022   11:58:28 AM200Ka2 = {[H+][X2-]} / [HX-]Here, Ka1and Ka2are called the first and second ionization constants respectively of the acid H2 X. Similarly, for tribasic acids like H3PO4 we have three ionization constants. The values of the ionization constants for some common \npolyprotic acids are given in Table 6.8.In general, when strength of H-A bond decreases, that is, the energy required to break \nthe bond decreases, HA becomes a stronger \nacid. Also, when the H-A bond becomes more \npolar i.e., the electronegativity difference \nbetween the atoms H and A increases and \nthere is marked charge separation, cleavage \nof the bond becomes easier thereby increasing \nthe acidity.But it should be noted that while comparing elements in the same group of the periodic \ntable, H-A bond strength is a more important \nfactor in determining acidity than its polar \nnature. As the size of A increases down the \ngroup, H-A bond strength decreases and so \nthe acid strength increases. For example,Size increasesHF \u003c\u003c HCl \u003c\u003c HBr \u003c\u003c HIAcid strength increasesSimilarly, H2S is stronger acid than H2O.But, when we discuss elements in the same row of the periodic table, H-A bond polarity \nbecomes the deciding factor for determining \nthe acid strength. As the electronegativity \nof A increases, the strength of the acid also \nincreases. For example,Electronegativity of A increasesCH4 \u003c NH3 \u003c H2O \u003c HFAcid strength increases6.11.8 Common Ion Effect in the Ionization of Acids and BasesConsider an example of acetic acid dissociation \nequilibrium represented as:CH3COOH(aq)   H+(aq) +  CH3COO– (aq) or  HAc(aq)   H+ (aq) + Ac– (aq)Ka = [H+][Ac– ] / [HAc]Addition of acetate ions to an acetic acid solution results in decreasing the \nconcentration of hydrogen ions, [H+]. Also, if H+ ions are added from an external source then the equilibrium moves in the direction \nof undissociated acetic acid i.e., in a direction \nof reducing the concentration of hydrogen \nions, [H+]. This phenomenon is an example Table 6.8 The Ionization Constants of Some Common Polyprotic Acids (298K)It can be seen that higher order ionization constants (Ka2, Ka3) are smaller than the lower order ionization constant (Ka1) of a polyprotic acid. The reason for this is that it is more difficult to remove a positively \ncharged proton from a negative ion due to \nelectrostatic forces. This can be seen in the \ncase of removing a proton from the uncharged \nH2CO3 as compared from a negatively charged HCO3–. Similarly, it is more difficult to remove a proton from a doubly charged HPO42– anion as compared to H2PO4–. Polyprotic acid solutions contain a mixture of acids like H2A, HA– and A2– in case of a diprotic acid. H2A being a strong acid, the primary reaction involves the dissociation of \nH2 A, and H3O+ in the solution comes mainly from the first dissociation step.6.11.7 Factors Affecting Acid StrengthHaving discussed quantitatively the strengths of acids and bases, we come to a stage where we can calculate the pH of a given acid \nsolution. But, the curiosity rises about why \nshould some acids be stronger than others? \nWhat factors are responsible for making \nthem stronger? The answer lies in its being a \ncomplex phenomenon. But, broadly speaking \nwe can say that the extent of dissociation of \nan acid depends on the strength and polarity of the H-A bond.Unit 6.indd   2009/12/2022   11:58:28 AM201of common ion effect. It can be defined as a shift in equilibrium on adding a substance that provides more of an ionic species already \npresent in the dissociation equilibrium. \nThus, we can say that common ion effect is \na phenomenon based on the Le Chatelier’s \nprinciple discussed in section 6.8.In order to evaluate the pH of the solution resulting on addition of 0.05M acetate ion to \n0.05M acetic acid solution, we shall consider \nthe acetic acid dissociation equilibrium once \nagain, HAc(aq)  H+(aq)   +  Ac–(aq)Initial concentration (M)    0.05      0         0.05 Let x be the extent of ionization of acetic acid.Change in concentration (M)      –x       +x          +x\nEquilibrium concentration (M)\n 0.05-x      x      0.05+x\nTherefore, Ka= [H+][Ac– ]/[H Ac] = {(0.05+x)(x)}/(0.05-x)As Ka is small for a very weak acid, x\u003c\u003c0.05. Hence, (0.05 + x) ≈ (0.05 – x) ≈  0.05Thus, \n1.8 × 10–5 = (x) (0.05 + x) / (0.05 – x) = x(0.05) / (0.05) = x = [H+] = 1.8 × 10–5MpH = – log(1.8 × 10–5) = 4.74Problem 6.24 Calculate the pH of a 0.10M ammonia solution. Calculate the pH after 50.0 mL \nof this solution is treated with 25.0 mL of \n0.10M HCl. The dissociation constant of \nammonia, Kb = 1.77 × 10–5Solution  NH3     +      H2O      →     NH4+    +    OH– Kb = [NH4+][OH–] / [NH3] = 1.77 × 10–5Before neutralization,[NH4+] = [OH–] = x[NH3] = 0.10 – x   0.10x2 / 0.10 = 1.77 × 10–5Thus, x = 1.33 × 10–3 = [OH–]Therefore, [H+] = Kw / [OH–] = 10–14 /              (1.33 × 10–3) = 7.51 × 10–12pH = –log (7.5 × 10–12) = 11.12On addition of 25 mL of 0.1M HCl solution (i.e., 2.5 mmol of HCl) to 50 \nmL of 0.1M ammonia solution (i.e., 5 \nmmol of NH3), 2.5 mmol of ammonia molecules are neutralized. The resulting \n75 mL solution contains the remaining \nunneutralized 2.5 mmol of NH3 molecules and 2.5 mmol of NH4+.NH3    +    HCl    →    NH4+ +  Cl–2.5           2.5              0          0At equilibrium \n0              0             2.5         2.5\nThe resulting 75 mL of solution contains 2.5 mmol of NH4+ ions (i.e.,  0.033 M) and 2.5 mmol (i.e.,  0.033 M ) of uneutralised \nNH3 molecules. This NH3 exists in the following equilibrium:NH4OH      NH4+   +     OH–0.033M – y               y              y\nwhere, y  =  [OH–]  =  [NH4+]The final 75 mL solution after neutralisation already contains  2.5 m mol NH4+ ions (i.e. 0.033M), thus total concentration of NH4+ ions is given as:[NH4+] = 0.033 + yAs y is small, [NH4OH]  0.033 M and [NH4+]  0.033M.We know,\nKb = [NH4+][OH–] / [NH4OH]      = y (0.033)/(0.033) = 1.77 × 10–5 MThus, y = 1.77 × 10–5 = [OH–][H+] = 10–14 / 1.77 × 10–5 = 0.56 × 10–9Hence, pH = 9.246.11.9 Hydrolysis of Salts and the pH of their SolutionsSalts formed by the reactions between acids �and bases in definite proportions, undergo ionization in water. The cations/anions Unit 6.indd   2019/12/2022   11:58:29 AM202formed on ionization of salts either exist as hydrated ions in aqueous solutions or interact \nwith water to reform corresponding acids/\nbases depending upon the nature of salts. \nThe later process of interaction between \nwater and cations/anions or both of salts \nis called hydrolysis. The pH of the solution \ngets affected by this interaction. The cations \n(e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+, Ba2+, etc.) of strong bases and anions (e.g., Cl–, Br–, NO3–, ClO4– etc.) of strong acids simply get hydrated but do not \nhydrolyse, and therefore the solutions of \nsalts formed from strong acids and bases are \nneutral i.e., their pH is 7. However, the other \ncategory of salts do undergo hydrolysis.We now consider the hydrolysis of the salts of the following types :(i) salts of weak acid and strong base e.g., CH3COONa.(ii) salts of strong acid and weak base e.g., \nNH4Cl, and(iii) salts of weak acid and weak base, e.g., \nCH3COONH4.In the first case, CH3COONa being a salt of weak acid, CH3COOH and strong base, NaOH gets completely ionised in aqueous solution.CH3COONa(aq)   →  CH3COO– (aq)+  Na+(aq)Acetate ion thus formed undergoes hydrolysis in water to give acetic acid and OH– ionsCH3COO–(aq)+H2O(l)CH3COOH(aq)+OH–(aq)Acetic acid being a weak acid  (Ka = 1.8 × 10–5) remains mainly unionised in solution. This results in increase of OH– ion concentration in solution making it alkaline. \nThe pH of such a solution is more than 7.Similarly, NH4Cl formed from weak base, NH4OH and strong acid, HCl, in water dissociates completely.NH4Cl(aq) → NH+4(aq)  +Cl– (aq)Ammonium ions undergo hydrolysis with water to form NH4OH and H+ ionsNH+4 (aq) + H2O (1)  NH4OH(aq) + H+(aq) Ammonium hydroxide is a weak base  (Kb = 1.77 × 10–5) and therefore remains almost unionised in solution. This results in increased of H+ ion concentration in solution making the solution acidic. Thus, the pH of NH4Cl solution in water is less than 7.Consider the hydrolysis of CH3COONH4 salt formed from weak acid and weak base. \nThe ions formed undergo hydrolysis as follow:CH3COO– + NH4+ +  H2O   CH3COOH +                                                                         NH4OHCH3COOH and NH4OH, also remain into partially dissociated form:CH3COOH         CH3COO–  +  H+NH4OH           NH4+    +   OH–H2O          H+  +  OH–Without going into detailed calculation, it can be said that degree of hydrolysis is independent of concentration of solution, and pH of such solutions is determined by their \npK values:  pH = 7 + ½ (pKa – pKb)                             (6.38)The pH of solution can be greater than 7, if the difference is positive and it will be less \nthan 7, if the difference is negative.Problem 6.25The pKa of acetic acid and pKb of ammonium hydroxide are 4.76 and 4.75 respectively. Calculate the pH of ammonium acetate \nsolution.SolutionpH = 7 + ½ [pKa – pKb]       = 7 + ½ [4.76 – 4.75]       = 7 + ½ [0.01]  = 7 + 0.005  = 7.0056.12 BUFFER SOLUTIONSMany body fluids e.g., blood or urine have definite pH and any deviation in their pH indicates malfunctioning of the body. The \ncontrol of pH is also very important in \nmany chemical and biochemical processes. \nMany medical and cosmetic formulations \nrequire that these be kept and administered \nat a particular pH. The solutions which resist change in pH on dilution or with the addition of small amounts of acid or \nalkali are called Buffer Solutions. Buffer Unit 6.indd   2029/12/2022   11:58:29 AM203solutions of known pH can be prepared from the knowledge of pKa of the acid or pKb of base and by controlling the ratio of the salt and acid \nor salt and base. A mixture of acetic acid and \nsodium acetate acts as buffer solution around \npH 4.75 and a mixture of ammonium chloride \nand ammonium hydroxide acts as a buffer \naround pH 9.25. You will learn more about buffer solutions in higher classes.6.12.1 Designing Buffer Solution Knowledge of pKa, pKb and equilibrium constant help us to prepare the buffer solution of known pH. Let us see how we can do this.Preparation of Acidic Buffer To prepare a buffer of  acidic pH we use weak acid and its salt formed with strong base. We develop the equation relating the pH, the \nequilibrium constant, Ka  of weak acid and ratio of concentration of weak acid and its \nconjugate base. For the general case where the weak acid HA ionises in water, HA + H2O  H3O+ + A–For which we can write the expressionRearranging the expression we have,Taking logarithm on both the sides and rearranging the terms we get —              Or                    (6.39)    (6.40) The expression (6.40) is known as Henderson–Hasselbalch equation. The quantity  is the ratio of concentration of conjugate base (anion) of the acid and the acid present in the mixture. Since acid is a weak acid, it ionises to a very little extent and \nconcentration of [HA] is negligibly different \nfrom concentration of acid taken to form \nbuffer. Also, most of the conjugate base, [A—], comes from the ionisation of salt of the acid. \nTherefore, the concentration of conjugate \nbase will be negligibly different from the \nconcentration of salt. Thus, equation (6.40) \ntakes the form: ppKaH=[Salt][Acid]+logIn the equation (6.39), if the concentration of [A—] is equal to the concentration of [HA], then pH = pKa because value of log 1 is zero. Thus if we take molar concentration of acid and salt (conjugate base) same, the pH of the \nbuffer solution will be equal to the pKa of the acid. So for preparing the buffer solution of \nthe required pH we select that acid whose pKa is close to the required pH. For acetic acid \npKa value is 4.76, therefore pH of the buffer solution formed by acetic acid and sodium \nacetate taken in equal molar concentration \nwill be around 4.76.A similar analysis of a buffer made with a weak base and its conjugate acid leads to the result,      pOH=p+log[Conjugateacid,BH+]  [Base,B]bK  (6.41) pH of the buffer solution can be calculated by using the equation pH + pOH =14.We know that pH + pOH = pKw  and  pKa + pKb = pKw. On putting these values in equation (6.41) it takes the form as follows: p- pH=pp[Conjugateacid,BH]  [Base,B]wwKKKa\u001f\u001e\u001elog                           or       pH=p[Conjugateacid,BH]  [Base,B]Ka++log    (6.42)If molar concentration of base and its conjugate acid (cation) is same then pH of the buffer solution will be same as pKa for the base. pKa value for ammonia is s9.25; therefore a buffer of pH close to 9.25 can be obtained \nby taking ammonia solution and ammonium Unit 6.indd   2039/12/2022   11:58:29 AM204chloride solution of same molar concentration. For a buffer solution formed by ammonium \nchloride and ammonium hydroxide, equation  (6.42) becomes:  pH=[Conjugateacid,BH]  [Base,B]925.log++                 pH of the buffer solution is not affected by dilution because ratio under the logarithmic term remains unchanged. 6.13 SOLUBILITY EQUILIBRIA OF SPARINGLY SOLUBLE SALTSWe have already known that the solubility of ionic solids in water varies a great deal. Some of \nthese (like calcium chloride) are so soluble that they are hygroscopic in nature and even absorb \nwater vapour from atmosphere. Others (such �as lithium fluoride) have so little solubility \nthat they are commonly termed as insoluble. \nThe solubility depends on a number of factors \nimportant amongst which are the lattice \nenthalpy of the salt and the solvation enthalpy \nof the ions in a solution. For a salt to dissolve \nin a solvent the strong forces of attraction \nbetween its ions (lattice enthalpy) must be \novercome by the ion-solvent interactions. The \nsolvation enthalpy of ions is referred to in \nterms of solvation which is always negative i.e. \nenergy is released in the process of solvation. \nThe amount of solvation enthalpy depends on \nthe nature of the solvent. In case of a non-\npolar (covalent) solvent, solvation enthalpy is �small and hence, not sufficient to overcome \nlattice enthalpy of the salt. Consequently, the \nsalt does not dissolve in non-polar solvent. As \na general rule, for a salt to be able to dissolve \nin a particular solvent its solvation enthalpy \nmust be greater than its lattice enthalpy so \nthat the latter may be overcome by former. \nEach salt has its characteristic solubility which \ndepends on temperature. We classify salts on \nthe basis of their solubility in the following \nthree categories. Category I     Soluble    Solubility \u003e 0.1M Category II    Slightly    0.01M\u003cSolubility\u003c 0.1M                      Soluble  Category III   Sparingly  Solubility \u003c 0.01M\n                      SolubleWe shall now consider the equilibrium between the sparingly soluble ionic salt and its saturated aqueous solution.6.13.1 Solubility Product ConstantLet us now have a solid like barium sulphate in contact with its saturated aqueous solution. The equilibrium between the undisolved solid \nand the ions in a saturated solution can be  \nrepresented by the equation:BaSO4(s)   Ba2+(aq) + SO42–(aq),The equilibrium constant is given by the equation:K = {[Ba2+][SO42–]} / [BaSO4]For a pure solid substance the concentration remains constant and we can writeKsp = K[BaSO4] = [Ba2+][SO42–]           (6.43)We call Ksp the solubility product constant or simply solubility product. The experimental \nvalue of Ksp in above equation at 298K is  1.1 × 10–10. This means that for solid barium sulphate in equilibrium with its saturated \nsolution, the product of the concentrations \nof barium and sulphate ions is equal \nto its solubility product constant. The \nconcentrations of the two ions will be equal to \nthe molar solubility of the barium sulphate. \nIf molar solubility is S, then 1.1 × 10–10 = (S)(S) = S2 or                       S = 1.05 × 10–5.Thus, molar solubility of barium sulphate will be equal to 1.05 × 10–5 mol L–1.A salt may give on dissociation two or more than two anions and cations carrying different charges. For example, consider a salt \nlike zirconium phosphate of molecular formula (Zr4+)3(PO43–)4. It dissociates into 3 zirconium cations of charge +4 and 4 phosphate \nanions of charge –3. If the molar solubility of \nzirconium phosphate is S, then it can be seen \nfrom the stoichiometry of the compound that[Zr4+] = 3S and [PO43–] = 4S and Ksp = (3S)3 (4S)4 = 6912 (S)7or S = {Ksp / (33 × 44)}1/7 = (Ksp / 6912)1/7Unit 6.indd   2049/12/2022   11:58:30 AM205A solid salt of the general formula MXxpyq\u001f\u001ewith molar solubility S in equilibrium with its saturated solution may be represented by \nthe equation:MxXy(s)          xMp+(aq) + yXq (aq)(where x × p+ = y × q)And its solubility product constant is given by:Ksp   = [Mp+]x[Xq– ]y = (xS)x(yS)y      (6.44)        = xx . yy . S(x + y)     S(x + y) = Ksp / xx . yyS = (Ksp / xx . yy)1 / x + y                                             (6.45)The term Ksp in equation is given by Qsp (section 6.6.2) when the concentration of one or more species is not the concentration under \nequilibrium. Obviously under equilibrium \nconditions Ksp = Qsp but otherwise it gives the direction of the processes of precipitation or \ndissolution. The solubility product constants \nof a number of common salts at 298K are given in Table 6.9.Table 6.9 The Solubility Product Constants, Ksp of Some Common Ionic Salts at 298K.Problem 6.26Calculate the solubility of A2X3 in pure water, assuming that neither kind of ion reacts with water. The solubility product of \nA2X3, Ksp = 1.1 × 10–23.SolutionA2X3 → 2A3+ + 3X2–Ksp = [A3+]2 [X2–]3 = 1.1 × 10–23If  S = solubility of A2X3, then[A3+] = 2S;  [X2–] = 3Stherefore, Ksp = (2S)2(3S)3 = 108S5                                         = 1.1 × 10–23thus, S5 = 1 × 10–25S = 1.0 × 10–5 mol/L.Problem 6.27The values of Ksp of two sparingly soluble salts Ni(OH)2 and AgCN are 2.0 × 10–15 and 6 × 0–17 respectively. Which salt is more soluble? Explain.SolutionAgCN    Ag+ + CN–Unit 6.indd   2059/12/2022   11:58:30 AM206Ksp =  [Ag+][CN–] = 6 × 10–17Ni(OH)2      Ni2+ + 2OH–Ksp = [Ni2+][OH–]2 = 2 × 10–15Let [Ag+] = S1, then [CN-] = S1Let [Ni2+] = S2, then [OH–] = 2S2S12 = 6 × 10–17 , S1 = 7.8 × 10–9(S2)(2S2)2 = 2 × 10–15, S2 = 0.58 × 10–4Ni(OH)2 is more soluble than AgCN.6.13.2 Common Ion Effect on Solubility of Ionic SaltsIt is expected from Le Chatelier’s principle that if we increase the concentration of any one of the ions, it should combine with the \nion of its opposite charge and some of the \nsalt will be precipitated till once again Ksp = Qsp. Similarly, if the concentration of one of the ions is decreased, more salt will dissolve \nto increase the concentration of both the ions \ntill once again Ksp = Qsp. This is applicable even to soluble salts like sodium chloride \nexcept that due to higher concentrations \nof the ions, we use their activities instead \nof their molarities in the expression for \nQsp. Thus if we take a saturated solution of sodium chloride and pass HCl gas through it, \nthen sodium chloride is precipitated due to \nincreased concentration (activity) of chloride \nion available from the dissociation of HCl. \nSodium chloride thus obtained is of very \nhigh purity and we can get rid of impurities \nlike sodium and magnesium sulphates. The \ncommon ion effect is also used for almost \ncomplete precipitation of a particular ion \nas its sparingly soluble salt, with very low \nvalue of solubility product for gravimetric \nestimation. Thus we can precipitate silver ion \nas silver chloride, ferric ion as its hydroxide \n(or hydrated ferric oxide) and barium ion as \nits sulphate for quantitative estimations.Dissolution of S mol/L of Ni(OH)2 provides S mol/L of Ni2+ and 2S mol/L of OH–, but the total concentration of OH– = (0.10 + 2S) mol/L because the solution already contains 0.10 mol/L of OH– from NaOH.Ksp = 2.0 × 10–15 = [Ni2+] [OH–]2                          = (S) (0.10 + 2S)2As Ksp is small, 2S \u003c\u003c 0.10, thus, (0.10 + 2S) ≈ 0.10Hence,\n2.0 × 10–15 = S (0.10)2S = 2.0 × 10–13 M = [Ni2+]Problem 6.28Calculate the molar solubility of Ni(OH)2 in 0.10 M NaOH. The ionic product of Ni(OH)2 is 2.0 × 10–15.Solution\nLet the solubility of Ni(OH)2 be equal to S. The solubility of salts of weak acids like phosphates increases at lower pH. This is because at lower pH the concentration of the \nanion decreases due to its protonation. This \nin turn increase the solubility of the salt so \nthat Ksp = Qsp. We have to satisfy two equilibria simultaneously i.e.,Ksp = [M+] [X–],                           [X–] / [HX] = Ka/[H+] Taking inverse of both side and adding 1 we getHXXHHXHXHaaa\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\n\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001d\n\u001c\u001b\n\u001a\u0019\u001f\u001e\u0019\u001d\n\u001c\u001b\n\u001a\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0018\u001d\n\u001c\u001b\n\u001a\u0019\u0017\u0019\u0017\u0017\u001911KKKNow, again taking inverse, we get[X–] / {[X–] + [HX]} = f = Ka/(Ka + [H+]) and it can be seen that ‘f’ decreases as pH decreases. If S is the solubility of the salt at a given  pH then Ksp = [S] [f S] = S2 {Ka/(Ka + [H+])} andS = {Ksp ([H+] + Ka)/Ka}1/2    (6.46)Thus solubility S increases with increase in [H+] or decrease in pH. Unit 6.indd   2069/12/2022   11:58:30 AM207SUMMARYWhen the number of molecules leaving the liquid to vapour equals the number of molecules returning to the liquid from vapour, equilibrium is said to be attained and is dynamic in \nnature. Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical processes and at \nthis stage rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Equilibrium constant, Kc is expressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants, each term raised to the �stoichiometric coefficient.For reaction, a A + b B        c C +d DKc = [C]c[D]d/[A]a[B]bEquilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage all the macroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. become constant. For a gaseous \nreaction equilibrium constant is expressed as Kp and is written by replacing concentration terms by partial pressures in Kc expression. The direction of reaction can be predicted by reaction quotient Qc which is equal to Kc at equilibrium. Le Chatelier’s principle states that the change in any factor such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc. will cause the \nequilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce or counteract the effect of the change. It can be used to study the effect of various factors such as temperature, concentration, \npressure, catalyst and inert gases on the direction of equilibrium and to control the yield of \nproducts by controlling these factors. Catalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition \nof a reaction mixture but increases the rate of chemical reaction by making available a new \nlower energy pathway for conversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.All substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes. Acids, bases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous solutions \nis due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of electrolytes in aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In weak electrolytes \nthere is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte molecules. According to \nArrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous \nsolutions. Brönsted-Lowry on the other hand, defined an acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor. When a Brönsted-Lowry acid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate \nbase and a conjugate acid corresponding to the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate \npair of acid-base differs only by one proton. Lewis further generalised the definition of an acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions \nfor ionization (equilibrium) constants of weak acids (Ka) and weak bases (Kb) are developed using Arrhenius definition. The degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and \ncommon ion are discussed. The pH scale (pH = –log[H+]) for the hydrogen ion concentration (activity) has been introduced and extended to other quantities (pOH = – log[OH–]); pKa = –log[Ka];  pKb = –log[Kb]; and pKw = –log[Kw] etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and we note that the equation: pH + pOH = pKw is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid and weak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo hydrolysis in �aqueous solution. The definition of buffer solutions,  and their importance are discussed briefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed and the equilibrium \nconstant is introduced as solubility product constant (Ksp).

    "input": "295UNIT 9After studying this unit, you will be able to • name hydrocarbons according to IUPAC system of nomenclature; • recognise and write structures  of isomers of alkanes, alkenes, alkynes and aromatic \nhydrocarbons;• learn about various methods of \npreparation of hydrocarbons;• distinguish between alkanes, \nalkenes, alkynes and aromatic \nhydrocarbons on the basis of physical and chemical properties;• draw and differentiate between \nvarious conformations of ethane;• appreciate the role of hydrocarbons as sources of  energy and for other industrial \napplications;• predict the formation of the addition products of \nunsymmetrical alkenes and \nalkynes on the basis of electronic \nmechanism;• comprehend the structure of benzene, explain aromaticity  and understand mechanism  of electrophilic substitution \nreactions of benzene; • predict the directive influence of substituents in monosubstituted \nbenzene ring;• learn about carcinogenicity and \ntoxicity.HYDROCARBONSThe term ‘hydrocarbon’ is self-explanatory which means compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons \nplay a key role in our daily life. You must be familiar \nwith the terms ‘LPG’ and ‘CNG’ used as fuels. LPG is the \nabbreviated form of liquified petroleum gas whereas CNG \nstands for compressed natural gas. Another term ‘LNG’ \n(liquified natural gas) is also in news these days. This is \nalso a fuel and is obtained by liquifaction of natural gas. \nPetrol, diesel and kerosene oil are obtained by the fractional \ndistillation of petroleum found under the earth’s crust.  Coal gas is obtained by the destructive distillation of \ncoal. Natural gas is found in upper strata during drilling \nof oil wells. The gas after compression is known as \ncompressed natural gas. LPG is used as a domestic fuel \nwith the least pollution. Kerosene oil is also used as a \ndomestic fuel but it causes some pollution. Automobiles \nneed fuels like petrol, diesel and CNG. Petrol and CNG \noperated automobiles cause less pollution. All these fuels \ncontain mixture of hydrocarbons, which are sources of \nenergy. Hydrocarbons are also used for the manufacture of polymers like polythene, polypropene, polystyrene etc. \nHigher hydrocarbons are used as solvents for paints. They \nare also used as the starting materials for manufacture \nof many dyes and drugs. Thus, you can well understand \nthe importance of hydrocarbons in your daily life. In this \nunit, you will learn more about hydrocarbons.9.1 CLASSIFICATIONHydrocarbons are of different types. Depending upon the types of carbon-carbon bonds present, they can be classified into three main categories – (i) saturated  Hydrocarbons are the important sources of energy.Unit 9.indd   29510/10/2022   10:37:52 AM296(ii) unsaturated and (iii) aromatic hydrocarbons. Saturated hydrocarbons \ncontain carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen \nsingle bonds. If different carbon atoms are \njoined together to form open chain of carbon \natoms with single bonds, they are termed \nas alkanes as you have already studied in  Unit 8. On the other hand, if carbon atoms \nform a closed chain or a ring, they are termed \nas cycloalkanes. Unsaturated hydrocarbons �contain carbon-carbon multiple bonds – \ndouble bonds, triple bonds or both. Aromatic \nhydrocarbons are a special type of cyclic \ncompounds. You can construct a large \nnumber of models of such molecules of both \ntypes (open chain and close chain) keeping \nin mind that carbon is tetravalent and \nhydrogen is monovalent. For making models \nof alkanes, you can use toothpicks for bonds \nand plasticine balls for atoms. For alkenes, \nalkynes and aromatic hydrocarbons, spring \nmodels can be constructed.9.2  ALKANES As already mentioned, alkanes are saturated open chain hydrocarbons containing  carbon - carbon single bonds. Methane (CH4) is the first member of this family. Methane is \na gas found in coal mines and marshy places. \nIf you replace one hydrogen atom of methane \nby carbon and join the required number of \nhydrogens to satisfy the tetravalence of the \nother carbon atom, what do you get? You \nget C2H6. This hydrocarbon with molecular formula C2H6 is known as ethane. Thus you can consider C2H6 as derived from CH4 by replacing one hydrogen atom by -CH3 group. Go on constructing alkanes by doing this \ntheoretical exercise i.e., replacing hydrogen �atom by –CH3 group. The next molecules will be C3H8, C4H10 … of the general formula for alkane family \nor homologous series? If we examine the formula of different alkanes we find that \nthe general formula for alkanes is CnH2n+2. It represents any particular homologue when n \nis given appropriate value. Can you recall the \nstructure of methane? According to VSEPR \ntheory (Unit 4), methane has a tetrahedral \nstructure (Fig. 9.1), in which carbon atom lies \nat the centre and the four hydrogen atoms lie \nat the four corners of a regular tetrahedron.  �All H-C-H  bond angles are of 109.5°. In alkanes, tetrahedra are joined together in which C-C and C-H bond lengths are  154 pm and 112 pm respectively (Unit 8). �You have already read that C–C and C–H σ bonds are formed by head-on overlapping of \nsp3 hybrid orbitals of carbon and 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms.9.2.1 Nomenclature and Isomerism You have already read about nomenclature of different classes of organic compounds in Unit 8. Nomenclature and isomerism \nin alkanes can further be understood with \nthe help of a few more examples. Common \nnames are given in parenthesis. First three �alkanes – methane, ethane and propane have \nonly one structure but higher alkanes can \nhave more than one structure. Let us write \nstructures for C4H10. Four carbon atoms of C4H10 can be joined either in a continuous chain or with a branched chain in the \nfollowing two ways :Fig. 9.1  Structure of methane   Butane (n- butane), (b.p. 273 K)I H H H     H—C—H replace any H by - CH3 H—C—C—H or C2H6    H H H  These hydrocarbons are inert under normal conditions as they do not react with acids, bases and other reagents. Hence, \nthey were earlier known as paraffins (latin : \nparum, little; affinis, affinity). Can you think Unit 9.indd   29611/10/2022   15:24:01297 In how many ways, you can join five carbon atoms and twelve hydrogen atoms of C5H12? They can be arranged in three ways as shown in structures III–Visomers. It is also clear that structures I and III have continuous chain of carbon atoms \nbut structures II, IV and V have a branched \nchain. Such structural isomers which differ \nin chain of carbon atoms are known as chain isomers. Thus, you have seen that C4H10 and C5H12 have two and three chain isomers respectively.Problem 9.1Write structures of different chain isomers of alkanes corresponding to the \nmolecular formula C6H14. Also write their IUPAC names.Solution(i) CH3 – CH2 – CH2 – CH2– CH2– CH3n-Hexane2-Methylpentane3-Methylpentane2,3-Dimethylbutane 2,2 - Dimethylbutane Based upon the number of carbon atoms attached to a carbon atom, the carbon atom is termed as primary (1°), secondary (2°), tertiary (3°) or quaternary (4°). Carbon atom attached \nto no other carbon atom as in methane or to \nonly one carbon atom as in ethane is called \nprimary carbon atom. Terminal carbon \natoms are always primary. Carbon atom \nattached to two carbon atoms is known as \nsecondary. Tertiary carbon is attached to \nthree carbon atoms and neo or quaternary \ncarbon is attached to four carbon atoms. Can �you identify 1°, 2°, 3° and 4° carbon atoms in II2-Methylpropane (isobutane)  (b.p.261 K)Structures I and II possess same molecular formula but differ in their boiling points and other properties. Similarly structures III, IV and V possess the same molecular formula \nbut have different properties. Structures I and \nII are isomers of butane, whereas structures \nIII, IV and V are isomers of pentane. Since \ndifference in properties is due to difference in \ntheir structures, they are known as structural IIIPentane (n-pentane)(b.p. 309 K) 2-Methylbutane (isopentane) (b.p. 301 K)IV2,2-Dimethylpropane (neopentane) (b.p. 282.5 K)VUnit 9.indd   29710/10/2022   10:37:53 AM298structures I to V ? If you go on constructing structures for higher alkanes, you will be \ngetting still larger number of isomers. C6H14 has got five isomers and C7H16 has nine. As many as 75 isomers are possible for C10H22. In structures II, IV and V, you observed that –CH3 group is attached to carbon atom numbered as 2. You will come across groups �like –CH3, –C2H5, –C3H7 etc. attached to carbon atoms in alkanes or other classes of compounds.  These groups or substituents are known as alkyl groups as they are derived \nfrom alkanes by removal of one hydrogen \natom. General formula for alkyl groups is \nCnH2n+1 (Unit 8).  Let us recall the general rules for nomenclature already discussed in Unit 8. Nomenclature of substituted alkanes can \nfurther be understood by considering the \nfollowing problem:Problem 9.2Write structures of different isomeric alkyl groups corresponding to the molecular formula C5H11.

From unsaturated hydrocarbonsDihydrogen gas adds to alkenes and alkynes \nin the presence of finely divided catalysts like \nplatinum, palladium or nickel to form alkanes. \nThis process is called hydrogenation. These metals adsorb dihydrogen gas on their �surfaces and activate the hydrogen – hydrogen \nbond. Platinum and palladium catalyse the \nreaction at room temperature but relatively \nhigher temperature and pressure are required \nwith nickel catalysts.CH2 =CH2 + H2 Pt/Pd/Ni CH3−CH3 Ethene Propane   (9.1)  CH2–CH=CH2 + H2 Pt/Pd/Ni CH3−CH2CH3 Propane Propane(9.2) \nCH3–C≡ C–H + 2H Pt/Pd/Ni CH3−CH2CH3 Propyne Propane(9.3)2.

Why?9.2.3 PropertiesPhysical propertiesAlkanes are almost non-polar molecules because of the covalent nature of C-C and C-H bonds and due to very little difference \nof electronegativity between carbon and \nhydrogen atoms. They possess weak van der \nWaals forces. Due to the weak forces, the first \nfour members, C1 to C4 are gases, C5 to C17 are liquids and those containing 18 carbon \natoms or more are solids at 298 K. They are \ncolourless and odourless. What do you think \nabout solubility of alkanes in water based \nupon non-polar nature of alkanes? Petrol \nis a mixture of hydrocarbons and is used \nas a fuel for automobiles. Petrol and lower \nfractions of petroleum are also used for  dry \ncleaning of clothes to remove grease stains. \nOn the basis of this observation, what do \nyou think about the nature of the greasy \nsubstance? You are correct if you say that grease (mixture of higher alkanes) is non-Unit 9.indd   30103-05-2024   17:16:25302polar and, hence, hydrophobic  in nature. It is generally observed that in relation to solubility \nof substances in solvents, polar substances \nare soluble in polar solvents, whereas the \nnon-polar ones in non-polar solvents i.e., like dissolves like. Boiling point (b.p.) of different alkanes are given in Table 9.2 from which it is clear that \nthere is a steady increase in boiling point with \nincrease in molecular mass. This is due to the \nfact that the intermolecular van der Waals \nforces increase with increase of the molecular \nsize or the surface area of the molecule.  You can make an interesting observation by having a look on the boiling points of  three isomeric pentanes viz., (pentane,  2-methylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpropane). It \nis observed (Table 9.2) that pentane having \na continuous chain of five carbon atoms has \nthe highest boiling point (309.1K) whereas  2,2 – dimethylpropane boils at 282.5K. With \nincrease in number of branched chains, \nthe molecule attains the shape of a sphere. \nThis results in smaller area of contact and \ntherefore weak intermolecular forces between \nspherical molecules, which are overcome at \nrelatively lower temperatures. Chemical propertiesAs already mentioned, alkanes are generally \ninert towards acids, bases, oxidising and reducing agents. However, they undergo \nthe following reactions under certain  conditions.1. Substitution reactionsOne or more hydrogen atoms of alkanes can be replaced by halogens, nitro group \nand sulphonic acid group. Halogenation takes place either at higher temperature  (573-773 K) or in the presence of diffused \nsunlight or ultraviolet light. Lower alkanes \ndo not undergo nitration and sulphonation \nreactions. These reactions in which hydrogen \natoms of alkanes are substituted are known \nas substitution reactions. As an example, chlorination of methane is given below:HalogenationCH2 + C1 hv     CH3C1 + HC1 Chloromethane (9.10)CH3C1  +  hv CH2 C12 + HC1 Dichloromethane (9.11)CH2C12  hv  CHC13 + HC1 Trichloromethane (9.12)CHC13  +  C12  hv  CC14 + HC1 Tetrachloromethane (9.13)Table 9.2 Variation of Melting Point and Boiling Point in AlkanesMolecular  Name Molecular b.p./(K) m.p./(K)formula  mass/u  CH4 Methane 16 111.0 90.5C2H6 Ethane 30 184.4 101.0C3H8 Propane 44 230.9 85.3C4H10 Butane 58 272.4 134.6C4H10 2-Methylpropane 58 261.0 114.7C5H12 Pentane 72 309.1 143.3C5H12 2-Methylbutane 72 300.9 113.1C5H12 2,2-Dimethylpropane 72 282.5 256.4C6H14 Hexane 86 341.9 178.5C7H16 Heptane 100 371.4 182.4C8H18 Octane 114 398.7 216.2C9H20 Nonane 128 423.8 222.0C10H22 Decane 142 447.1 243.3C20H42 Eicosane 282 615.0 236.2Unit 9.indd   30210/10/2022   10:37:54 AM303CH3–CH3  +  C12  hv  CH3–CH2C1   +   HC1 Chloroethane (9.14) It is found that the rate of reaction of alkanes with halogens is F2 \u003e Cl2 \u003e Br2 \u003e I2. Rate of replacement of hydrogens of alkanes is :  3° \u003e 2° \u003e 1°. Fluorination is too violent to be controlled. Iodination is very slow and a \nreversible reaction. It can be carried out in the \npresence of oxidizing agents like HIO3 or HNO3.CH4+I2  CH3I+HI (9.15)HIO3+5HI→312+3H2O (9.16) Halogenation is supposed to proceed via free radical chain mechanism involving three steps namely initiation, propagation and termination as given below:Mechanism (i) Initiation : The reaction is initiated by homolysis of chlorine molecule in the presence of light or heat. The Cl–Cl bond �is weaker than the C–C and C–H bond and \nhence, is easiest to break.C1–C1   hvhomolysis C.   H3 + C1   Chlorine free radicals(ii) Propagation : Chlorine free radical attacks the methane molecule and takes the reaction in the forward direction by breaking \nthe C-H bond to generate methyl free radical \nwith the formation of H-Cl.(a) CH4 +  C+ 1  hv C+  H3 + H–C1 The methyl radical thus obtained attacks the second molecule of chlorine to form  CH3 – Cl with the liberation of another chlorine free radical by homolysis of chlorine molecule.\n(b) CH3 +  C1–C1 hv CH3 – C1 + C1 The chlorine and methyl free radicals generated above repeat steps (a) and (b) respectively and thereby setup a chain of reactions. The propagation steps (a) and \n(b) are those which directly give principal \nproducts, but many other propagation steps are possible and may occur. Two such steps given below explain how more highly \nhaloginated products are formed.CH3C1 + C.   1 → C.   H2C1 + HC1C.   H2C1 + C1– C1 → CH2C12  + C.   1(iii)  Termination: The reaction stops after some time due to consumption of reactants  and / or due to the following side reactions : The possible chain terminating steps are:(a) C.   1 + C.   1 → C1–C1(b) H3 C.    + C.    H3 → H3C– CH3(c) H3 C.   1  +  C.   1  →  H3C–C1 Though in (c), CH3 – Cl,  the one of the products is formed but free radicals are consumed and the chain is terminated. The \nabove mechanism helps us to understand \nthe reason for the formation of ethane as a \nbyproduct during chlorination of methane. 2. Combustion Alkanes on heating in the presence of air or dioxygen are completely oxidized to carbon \ndioxide and water with the evolution of large \namount of heat.4222è-1c410222è-1cCH(g)20(g)CO(g)2HO(1);ÄH890kJmol(9.17)CH(g)13/2O(g)4CO(g)5HO(1)ÄH2875.84kJmol(9.18)+→+−+→+=−        The general combustion equation for any alkane is :n2n+22223n1CHOnCO(n1)HO2++→++ (9.19) Due to the evolution of large amount of heat during combustion, alkanes are used as fuels.During incomplete combustion of alkanes with insufficient amount of air or dioxygen, carbon black is formed which is used in \nthe manufacture of ink, printer ink, black \npigments and as filters.Unit 9.indd   30310/10/2022   10:37:54 AM304CH4(g) + O2(g) incompletecombustion C(s)+2H2 O(1) (9.20)3.

Isomerisation \nn-Alkanes on heating in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride and hydrogen chloride gas isomerise to branched chain \nalkanes. Major products are given below. \nSome minor products are also possible which \nyou can think over. Minor products are \ngenerally not reported in organic reactions.CH3(CH)2)4CH3Anhy, AICI3/ HCI  n-Hexane \nCH3CH–(CH2)2–CH3+CH3CH2–CH–CH2–CH3   CH3 CH32-Methylpentane 3-Methylpenatone(9.25)5. Aromatization \nn-Alkanes having six or more carbon atoms \non heating to 773K at 10-20 atmospheric pressure in the presence of oxides of vanadium, molybdenum or chromium supported over \nalumina get dehydrogenated and cyclised to \nbenzene and its homologues. This reaction is \nknown as aromatization or reforming.(9.26) Toluene (C7H8) is methyl derivative of benzene. Which alkane do you suggest for \npreparation of toluene ?6. Reaction with steam  Methane reacts with steam at 1273 K in the \npresence of nickel catalyst to form carbon \nmonoxide and dihydrogen. This method is \nused for industrial preparation of dihydrogen \ngasCH4  +  H2IO Ni∆ CO  +  3H2 (9.27)7. Pyrolysis Higher alkanes on heating to higher \ntemperature decompose into lower alkanes, \nalkenes etc. Such a decomposition reaction \ninto smaller fragments by the application of heat is called pyrolysis or cracking.(9.28) Pyrolysis of alkanes is believed to be a free radical reaction. Preparation of oil gas \nor petrol gas from kerosene oil or petrol involves the principle of pyrolysis. For \nexample, dodecane, a constituent of kerosene \noil on heating to 973K in the presence of \nplatinum, palladium or nickel gives a mixture \nof heptane and pentene.C12H26 Pt/Pd/Ni973K C7H16  +  C5H10 + Other ProductsDodecane Heptane Pentene(9.29)Unit 9.indd   30403-05-2024   16:28:293059.2.4 ConformationsAlkanes contain carbon-carbon sigma (σ) bonds. Electron distribution of the sigma molecular orbital is symmetrical around the �internuclear axis of the C–C bond which is \nnot disturbed due to rotation about its axis. �This permits free rotation about C–C single \nbond. This rotation results into different \nspatial arrangements of atoms in space \nwhich can change into one another. Such \nspatial arrangements of atoms which can \nbe converted into one another by rotation \naround a C-C single bond are called \nconformations or conformers or rotamers. Alkanes can thus have infinite number of \nconformations by rotation around C-C single \nbonds. However, it may be remembered that \nrotation around a C-C single bond is not \ncompletely free. It is hindered by a small \nenergy barrier of 1-20 kJ mol–1 due to weak repulsive interaction between the adjacent \nbonds. Such a type of repulsive interaction \nis called torsional strain. Conformations of ethane : Ethane molecule (C2H6) contains a carbon – carbon single bond with each carbon atom attached \nto three hydrogen atoms.  Considering the \nball and stick model of ethane, keep one \ncarbon atom stationary and rotate the other \ncarbon atom around the C-C axis. This \nrotation results into infinite number of spatial \narrangements of hydrogen atoms attached to \none carbon atom with respect to the hydrogen \natoms attached to the other carbon atom. \nThese are called conformational isomers (conformers). Thus there are infinite number \nof conformations of ethane. However, there are \ntwo extreme cases. One such conformation \nin which hydrogen atoms attached to two \ncarbons are as closed together as possible is \ncalled eclipsed conformation and the other in which hydrogens are as far apart as possible \nis known as the staggered conformation. Any other intermediate conformation is called a \nskew conformation.It may be remembered that in all the conformations, the bond angles \nand the bond lengths remain the same. \nEclipsed and the staggered conformations can be represented by Sawhorse and Newman projections.1. Sawhorse projections \nIn this projection, the molecule is viewed \nalong the molecular axis. It is then projected �on paper by drawing the central C–C bond \nas a somewhat longer straight line. Upper \nend of the line is  slightly tilted towards \nright or left hand side. The front carbon is \nshown at the lower end of the line, whereas \nthe rear carbon is shown at the upper end. \nEach carbon has three lines attached to it \ncorresponding to three hydrogen atoms. �The lines are inclined at an angle of 120° to \neach other. Sawhorse projections of eclipsed \nand staggered conformations of ethane are \ndepicted in Fig. 9.2.2. Newman projections In this projection, the molecule is viewed at the �C–C bond head on. The carbon atom nearer \nto the eye is represented by a point. Three \nhydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon \natom are shown by three lines drawn at an �angle of 120° to each other. The rear carbon \natom (the carbon atom away from the eye) is \nrepresented by a circle and the three hydrogen \natoms are shown attached to it by the shorter �lines drawn at an angle of 120° to each other. \nThe Newman’s projections are depicted in  Fig. 9.3.Fig. 9.2  Sawhorse projections of ethaneFig. 9.3  Newman’s projections of ethaneUnit 9.indd   30510/10/2022   10:37:54 AM306Fig. 9.4 Orbital picture of ethene depicting  σ bonds onlyRelative stability of conformations: As mentioned earlier, in staggered form of ethane, the electron clouds of carbon-hydrogen bonds \nare as far apart as possible. Thus, there are \nminimum repulsive forces, minimum energy \nand maximum stability of the molecule. On the \nother hand, when the staggered form changes \ninto the eclipsed form, the electron clouds of the �carbon – hydrogen bonds come closer to each \nother resulting in increase in electron cloud \nrepulsions. To check the increased repulsive \nforces, molecule will have to possess more \nenergy and thus has lesser stability. As already \nmentioned, the repulsive interaction between \nthe electron clouds, which affects stability of \na conformation, is called torsional strain.  \nMagnitude of torsional strain depends upon �the angle of rotation about C–C bond. This \nangle is also called dihedral angle or torsional angle. Of all the conformations of ethane, the \nstaggered form has the least torsional strain \nand the eclipsed form, the maximum torsional \nstrain. Therefore, staggered conformation is \nmore stable than the eclipsed conformation. \nHence, molecule largely remains in staggered \nconformation or we can say that it is preferred \nconformation. Thus it may be inferred that �rotation around C–C bond in ethane is not \ncompletely free.  The energy difference between \nthe two extreme forms is of the order of 12.5 \nkJ mol–1, which is very small. Even at ordinary temperatures, the ethane molecule gains \nthermal or kinetic energy sufficient enough to \novercome this energy barrier of 12.5 kJ mol–1 through intermolecular collisions. Thus, it \ncan be said that rotation about carbon-carbon \nsingle bond in ethane is almost free for all \npractical purposes. It has not been possible to \nseparate and isolate different conformational \nisomers of ethane.9.3 ALKENESAlkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing at least one double bond. What should be the general formula of alkenes? If \nthere is one double bond between two carbon \natoms in alkenes, they must possess two \nhydrogen atoms less than alkanes. Hence, \ngeneral formula for alkenes is CnH2n. Alkenes are also known as olefins (oil forming) since the first member, ethylene or ethene (C2H4) was found to form an oily liquid on reaction \nwith chlorine.9.3.1 Structure of Double BondCarbon-carbon double bond in alkenes consists of one strong sigma (σ) bond (bond enthalpy about 397 kJ mol–1) due to head-on overlapping of sp2 hybridised orbitals and one weak pi (π) bond (bond enthalpy about \n284 kJ mol–1) obtained by lateral or sideways overlapping of the two 2p orbitals of the two \ncarbon atoms. The double bond is shorter in �bond length (134 pm) than the C–C single \nbond (154 pm). You have already read that \nthe pi (π) bond is a weaker bond due to poor \nsideways overlapping between the two 2p \norbitals. Thus, the presence of the pi (π) bond \nmakes alkenes behave as sources of loosely \nheld mobile electrons. Therefore, alkenes are \neasily attacked by reagents or compounds \nwhich are in search of electrons. Such \nreagents are called electrophilic reagents. \nThe presence of weaker π-bond makes alkenes unstable molecules in comparison to alkanes \nand thus, alkenes can be changed into single \nbond compounds by combining with the \nelectrophilic reagents. Strength of the double \nbond (bond enthalpy, 681 kJ mol–1) is greater than that of a carbon-carbon single bond in \nethane (bond enthalpy, 348 kJ mol–1). Orbital diagrams of ethene molecule are shown in  Figs. 9.4 and 9.5.9.3.2 NomenclatureFor nomenclature of alkenes in IUPAC system, the longest chain of carbon atoms containing the double bond is selected. Numbering of the \nchain is done from the end which is nearer to Unit 9.indd   30611/10/2022   15:26:35307the double bond. The suffix ‘ene’ replaces ‘ane’ of alkanes. It may be remembered that  first member of alkene series is: CH2 (replacing n by 1 in CnH2n) known as methene but has a very short life. As already mentioned, first \nstable member of alkene series is C2H4 known as ethylene (common) or ethene (IUPAC). \nIUPAC names of a few members of alkenes \nare given below :Structure IUPAC nameCH3 – CH = CH2 PropeneCH3 – CH2 – CH = CH2 But – l - eneCH3 – CH = CH–CH3 But-2-eneCH2 = CH – CH = CH2 Buta – 1,3 - dieneCH2 = C – CH3 2-Methylprop-1-ene          |          CH3CH2 = CH – CH – CH3 3-Methylbut-1-ene          |          CH3Problem  9.7Write IUPAC names of the following compounds:(i) (CH3)2CH – CH =  CH – CH2 – CH   \t\t\t\t    CH3 – CH – CH         |         C2H5(ii)(iii) CH2 = C (CH2CH2CH3)2(iv) CH3 CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2CH3 | |     CH3 – CHCH = C – CH2 – CHCH3   |   CH3Solution(i) 2,8-Dimethyl-3, 6-decadiene;(ii) 1,3,5,7 Octatetraene; (iii) 2-n-Propylpent-1-ene;(iv) 4-Ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-dec-4-ene;Problem 9.8Calculate number of sigma (σ) and pi (π) bonds in the above structures (i-iv).Solutionσ bonds : 33, π bonds : 2σ bonds : 17, π bonds : 4σ bonds : 23, π bond : 1σ bonds : 41, π bond : 19.3.3 Isomerism Alkenes show both structural isomerism and geometrical isomerism.Structural isomerism : As in alkanes, ethene (C2H4) and propene (C3H6) can have only one structure but alkenes higher than propene have different structures. Alkenes possessing \nC4H8 as molecular formula can be written in the following three ways:I. 1 2 3 4 CH2 = CH – CH2 – CH3  But-1-ene (C4H8)   II.  1  2  3  4 CH3 – CH = CH – CH3  But-2-ene (C4H8)Fig. 9.5 Orbital picture of ethene showing formation of (a) π-bond, (b) π-cloud and (c) bond angles and bond lengths Unit 9.indd   30710/10/2022   10:37:55 AM308III. 1 2 3 CH2 = C – CH3 | CH3 2-Methylprop-1-ene (C4H8) Structures I and III, and II and III are the examples of chain isomerism whereas structures I and II are position isomers.Problem 9.9Write structures and IUPAC names of different structural isomers of alkenes \ncorresponding to C5H10.Solution(a) CH2 = CH – CH2 – CH2 – CH3  Pent-1-ene(b) CH3 – CH=CH  – CH2 – CH3 Pent-2-ene(c) CH3 – C = CH – CH3 | CH3 2-Methylbut-2-ene(d) CH3 – CH – CH = CH2 | CH3 3-Methylbut-1-ene(e) CH2 = C – CH2 – CH3 | CH3  2-Methylbut-1-ene Geometrical isomerism: Doubly bonded carbon atoms have to satisfy the remaining two valences by joining with two atoms or \ngroups. If the two atoms or groups attached to each carbon atom are different, they can \nbe represented by YX C = C XY like structure.  YX C = C XY can be represented in space in \nthe following two ways : In (a), the two identical atoms i.e., both the X or both the Y lie on the same side \nof the double bond but in (b) the two X or \ntwo Y lie across the double bond or on the \nopposite sides of the double bond. This results in different geometry of (a) and (b) i.e. \ndisposition of atoms or groups in space in \nthe two arrangements is different. Therefore, \nthey are stereoisomers. They would have the \nsame geometry if atoms or groups around \nC=C bond can be rotated but rotation around \nC=C bond is not free. It is restricted. For \nunderstanding this concept, take two pieces \nof strong cardboards and join them with the \nhelp of two nails. Hold one cardboard in your \none hand and try to rotate the other. Can \nyou really rotate the other cardboard ? The \nanswer is no. The rotation is restricted. This \nillustrates that the restricted rotation of atoms \nor groups around the doubly bonded carbon \natoms gives rise to different geometries of \nsuch compounds. The stereoisomers of this \ntype are called geometrical isomers. The \nisomer of the type (a), in which two identical \natoms or groups lie on the same side of the \ndouble bond is called cis  isomer and the other isomer of the type (b), in which identical \natoms or groups lie on the opposite sides of \nthe double bond is called trans isomer . Thus cis and trans isomers have the same structure but have different configuration (arrangement \nof atoms or groups in space). Due to different \narrangement of atoms or groups in space, \nthese isomers differ in their properties like \nmelting point, boiling point, dipole moment, \nsolubility etc. Geometrical or cis-trans isomers \nof but-2-ene are represented below : Cis form of alkene is found to be more polar than the trans form. For example, dipole moment of cis-but-2-ene is 0.33 Debye, \nwhereas, dipole moment of the trans form  is almost zero or it can be said that  Unit 9.indd   30803-05-2024   16:07:55309trans-but-2-ene is non-polar. This can be understood by drawing geometries of the two \nforms as given below from which it is clear \nthat in the trans-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups are in opposite directions, Threfore, \ndipole moments of C-CH3 bonds cancel, thus  making the trans form non-polar. (ii) CH2 = CBr2(iii) C6H5CH = CH – CH3(iv) CH3CH = CCl CH3Solution(iii) and (iv). In structures (i) and (ii), two \nidentical groups are attached to one of \nthe doubly bonded carbon atom.9.3.4 Preparation 1. From alkynes: Alkynes on partial reduction with calculated amount of dihydrogen in the presence of palladised charcoal partially deactivated with poisons \nlike sulphur compounds or quinoline give \nalkenes. Partially deactivated palladised \ncharcoal is known as Lindlar’s catalyst. \nAlkenes thus obtained are having cis geometry. However, alkynes on reduction \nwith sodium in liquid ammonia form trans alkenes.(9.30)(9.31)iii) CH≡ CH+H2 Pd/C CH2 =CH2     (9.32) Ethyne Etheneiv) CH3–C≡ CH+H2 Pd/C CH3–CH =CH2 Propyne Propene(9.33) Will propene thus obtained show geometrical isomerism? Think for the reason in support of your answer.2. From alkyl halides: Alkyl halides (R-X) on heating with alcoholic potash (potassium \nhydroxide dissolved in alcohol, say,  In the case of solids, it is observed that the trans isomer has higher melting point than the cis form.

This reaction is \nknown as dehydrohalogenation i.e., \nremoval of halogen acid. This is example \nof β-elimination reaction, since hydrogen atom is eliminated from the β carbon atom (carbon atom next to the carbon to which \nhalogen is attached). (9.34) Nature of halogen atom and the alkyl group determine rate of the reaction. It is observed \nthat for halogens, the rate is: iodine \u003e \nbromine \u003e chlorine, while for alkyl groups \nit is : tertiary \u003e secondary \u003e primary. 3. From vicinal dihalides: Dihalides in which two halogen atoms are attached \nto  two adjacent carbon atoms are known as vicinal dihalides. Vicinal dihalides on treatment with zinc metal lose a molecule \nof ZnX2 to form an alkene. This reaction is known  as dehalogenation.CH2Br–CH2Br + Zn  CH2=CH2+ ZnBr2(9.35)CH3CHBr–CH2Br + Zn  CH3CH=CH2  +ZnBr2(9.36)4. From alcohols by acidic dehydration: \nYou have read during nomenclature of different homologous series in Unit 12 \nthat alcohols are the hydroxy derivatives �of alkanes. They are represented by R–OH \nwhere, R is CnH2n+1. Alcohols on heating with concentrated sulphuric acid form \nalkenes with the elimination of one water \nmolecule. Since a water molecule is \neliminated from the alcohol molecule in \nthe presence of an acid, this reaction is \nknown as acidic dehydration of alcohols. This reaction is also the example of   β-elimination reaction since –OH group takes out one hydrogen atom from the  β-carbon atom.(9.37)9.3.5 PropertiesPhysical properties\nAlkenes as a class resemble alkanes in physical properties, except in types of \nisomerism and difference in polar nature. \nThe first three members are gases, the next \nfourteen are liquids and the higher ones are \nsolids. Ethene is a colourless gas with a faint \nsweet smell. All other alkenes are colourless \nand odourless, insoluble in water but fairly \nsoluble in non-polar solvents like benzene, \npetroleum ether. They show a regular increase \nin boiling point with increase in size i.e., every �– CH2 group added increases boiling point by 20–30 K. Like alkanes, straight chain alkenes \nhave higher boiling point than isomeric \nbranched chain compounds.Chemical propertiesAlkenes are the rich source of loosely held  pi (π) electrons, due to which they show addition reactions in which the electrophiles \nadd on to the carbon-carbon double bond to \nform the addition products.  Some reagents \nalso add by free radical mechanism. There \nare cases when under special conditions, \nalkenes also undergo free radical substitution �reactions. Oxidation and ozonolysis reactions \nare also quite prominent in alkenes. A brief \ndescription of different reactions of alkenes \nis given  below:1. Addition of dihydrogen: Alkenes add up one molecule of dihydrogen gas in the presence of finely divided nickel, \npalladium or platinum to form alkanes \n(Section 9.2.2)2. Addition of halogens : Halogens like bromine or chlorine add up to alkene to \nform vicinal dihalides. However, iodine does not show addition reaction under Unit 9.indd   31003-05-2024   16:08:27311normal conditions. The reddish orange colour of bromine solution in carbon \ntetrachloride is discharged when bromine \nadds up to an unsaturation site. This \nreaction is used as a test for unsaturation. \nAddition of halogens to alkenes is an \nexample of electrophilic addition reaction \ninvolving cyclic halonium ion formation \nwhich you will study in higher classes.(9.38) (9.39)3. Addition of hydrogen halides: Hydrogen halides (HCl, HBr,HI) add up to alkenes to form alkyl halides. The order of reactivity of the hydrogen halides is  HI \u003e HBr \u003e HCl. Like addition of halogens \nto alkenes, addition of hydrogen halides is \nalso an example of electrophilic addition \nreaction. Let us illustrate this by taking \naddition of HBr to symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkenes Addition reaction of HBr to symmetrical alkenes\nAddition reactions of HBr to symmetrical \nalkenes (similar groups attached to double \nbond) take place by electrophilic addition \nmechanism. CH2=CH2+H–Br  CH3–CH2–Br (9.40)CH3–CH=CH–CH3+HBr  CH3–CH–CHCH3  Br(9.41)Addition reaction of HBr to unsymmetrical alkenes (Markovnikov Rule)�How will H – Br add to propene ? The two possible products are I and II.(9.42)Markovnikov, a Russian chemist made a \ngeneralisation in 1869 after studying such \nreactions in detail. These generalisations \nled Markovnikov to frame a rule called \nMarkovnikov rule. The rule states that \nnegative part of the addendum (adding \nmolecule) gets attached to that carbon atom \nwhich possesses lesser number of hydrogen \natoms. Thus according to this rule, product \nI i.e., 2-bromopropane is expected. In actual practice, this is the principal product of the \nreaction. This generalisation of Markovnikov \nrule can be better understood in terms of \nmechanism of the reaction.Mechanism Hydrogen bromide provides an electrophile, \nH+, which attacks the double bond to form carbocation as shown below :(i)  The secondary carbocation (b) is more \nstable than the primary carbocation \n(a), therefore, the former predominates because it is formed at a faster rate.(ii)  The carbocation (b) is attacked by Br– ion to form the  product as follows :2-Bromopropane (major product)(a) less stable primary carbocation(b) more stable secondary carbocationUnit 9.indd   31110/27/2022   2:19:43 PM312Anti Markovnikov addition or peroxide effect or Kharash effectIn the presence of peroxide, addition of HBr \nto unsymmetrical alkenes like propene takes \nplace contrary to the Markovnikov rule. This \nhappens only with HBr but not with HCl \nand Hl. This addition reaction was observed  by M.S. Kharash and F.R. Mayo in 1933 \nat the University of Chicago. This reaction \nis known as peroxide or Kharash effect  or addition reaction anti to Markovnikov  rule.CH3 – CH=CH2+HBr (C6H5CO)2O2 CH3–CH2 CH2Br1–Bromopropane(9.43)Mechanism : Peroxide effect proceeds via free radical chain mechanism as given below:(ii) C.   6H5+H–Br Homolysis C6H3+ B.   r The secondary free radical obtained in the above mechanism (step iii) is more stable than the primary. This explains the formation of  1-bromopropane as the major product. It may be noted that the peroxide effect is not observed \nin addition of HCl and HI. This may be due  to the fact that the H–Cl bond being  stronger (430.5 kJ mol–1) than H–Br bond  (363.7 kJ mol–1), is not cleaved by the  free radical, whereas the H–I bond is weaker  (296.8 kJ mol–1) and iodine free radicals combine to form iodine molecules instead of \nadding to the double bond. Problem 9.12Write IUPAC names of the products obtained by addition reactions of HBr to  \nhex-1-ene (i) in the absence of peroxide and  (ii) in the presence of peroxide.Solution4. Addition of sulphuric acid : Cold concentrated sulphuric acid adds to alkenes in accordance with Markovnikov rule to form alkyl hydrogen sulphate by \nthe electrophilic addition reaction.(i)Unit 9.indd   31210/10/2022   10:37:56 AM313(9.44)(9.45)5. Addition of water : In the presence of a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid alkenes react with water to form alcohols, in accordance with the Markovnikov rule.(9.46)6. Oxidation: Alkenes on reaction with cold, dilute, aqueous solution of potassium \npermanganate (Baeyer’s reagent) produce vicinal glycols. Decolorisation of KMnO4 solution is used as a test for unsaturation.(9.47)(9.48)b) Acidic potassium permanganate or acidic \npotassium dichromate oxidises alkenes to ketones and/or acids depending upon the nature of the alkene and the experimental \nconditions (9.49)CH3 – CH=CH–CH3 KMnO4/H+ 2CH3COOHBut-2-ene Ethanoic acid(9.50)7. Ozonolysis : Ozonolysis of alkenes \ninvolves the addition of ozone molecule to alkene to form ozonide, and then cleavage \nof the ozonide by Zn-H2O to smaller molecules. This reaction is highly useful \nin detecting the position of the double \nbond in alkenes or other unsaturated \ncompounds. (9.51)(9.52)8. Polymerisation: You are familiar with polythene bags and polythene sheets. Polythene is obtained by the combination \nof large number of ethene molecules at \nhigh temperature, high pressure and \nin the presence of a catalyst. The large \nmolecules thus obtained are called \npolymers. This reaction is known as \npolymerisation. The simple compounds from which polymers are made are called Unit 9.indd   31303-05-2024   16:08:51314monomers. Other alkenes also undergo polymerisation.n(CH2 =CH2) High temp./pressureCatalyst —(  CH2–CH2 )— Polythene(9.53)n(CH3 –CH=CH2) High temp./pressureCatalyst —(  CH–CH2 )—n  CH3Polypropene(9.54) Polymers are used for the manufacture of plastic \nbags, squeeze bottles, refrigerator dishes, toys, pipes, radio and T.V. cabinets etc. Polypropene \nis used for the manufacture of milk crates, \nplastic buckets and other moulded articles. \nThough these materials have now become \ncommon, excessive use of polythene and \npolypropylene is a matter of great concern for \nall of us.9.4 ALKYNESLike alkenes, alkynes are also unsaturated hydrocarbons. They contain at least one triple bond between two carbon atoms. The number \nof hydrogen atoms is still less in alkynes as \ncompared to alkenes or alkanes. Their general \nformula is CnH2n–2.  The first stable member of alkyne series is ethyne which is popularly known as \nacetylene. Acetylene is used for arc welding \npurposes in the form of oxyacetylene flame \nobtained by mixing acetylene with oxygen \ngas. Alkynes are starting materials for a large \nnumber of organic compounds. Hence, it \nis interesting to study this class of organic \ncompounds.9.4.1 Nomenclature and IsomerismIn common system, alkynes are named as derivatives of acetylene. In IUPAC system, they are named as derivatives of the corresponding \nalkanes replacing ‘ane’ by the suffix ‘yne’. \nThe position of the triple bond is indicated \nby the first triply bonded carbon. Common \nand IUPAC names of a few members of alkyne \nseries are given in Table 9.2. You have already learnt that ethyne and propyne have got only one structure but there are two possible structures for butyne –  (i) but-1-yne and (ii) but-2-yne. Since these \ntwo compounds differ in their structures \ndue to the position of the triple bond, they \nare known as position isomers. In how \nmany ways, you can construct the structure \nfor the next homologue i.e., the next alkyne \nwith molecular formula  C5H8? Let us try to arrange five carbon atoms with a continuous \nchain and with a side chain. Following are the \npossible structures : Structure IUPAC nameI.   1 2 3 4 5HC≡ C– CH2– CH2– CH3 Pent–1-yneII.  1 2 3  4 5H3C–C≡ C– CH2– CH3 Pent–2-yneIII.   4 3 2  1H3C–CH–C≡  CH | CH3          3-Methyl but–1-yne Structures I and II are position isomers and structures I and III or II and III are chain \nisomers.Problem 9.13Write structures of different isomers \ncorresponding to the 5th member of alkyne series. Also write IUPAC names of \nall the isomers. What type of isomerism \nis exhibited by different pairs of isomers?Solution 5th member of alkyne has the molecular formula C6H10.

Structure of ethyne is shown in  Fig. 9.6. Each carbon atom of ethyne has two sp hybridised orbitals. Carbon-carbon sigma (σ) bond is obtained by the head-on overlapping \nof the two sp hybridised orbitals of the two \ncarbon atoms. The remaining sp hybridised \norbital of each carbon atom undergoes \noverlapping along the internuclear axis with \nthe 1s orbital of each of the two hydrogen atoms forming two C-H sigma bonds. �H-C-C bond angle is of 180°. Each carbon \nhas two unhybridised p orbitals which are perpendicular to each other as well as to the \nplane of the C-C sigma bond. The 2p orbitals \nof one carbon atom are parallel to the 2p orbitals of the other carbon atom, which undergo lateral or sideways overlapping to \nform two pi (π) bonds between two carbon \natoms. Thus ethyne molecule consists of one �C–C σ bond,  two C–H σ bonds and two C–C π bonds. The strength of C≡C bond (bond enthalpy 823 kJ mol-1) is more than those of C=C bond (bond enthalpy 681 kJ mol–1) and C–C bond (bond enthalpy 348 kJ mol–1). The C≡C bond length is shorter (120 pm) than those of C=C (133 pm) and C–C (154 \npm). Electron cloud between two carbon \natoms is cylindrically symmetrical about the \ninternuclear axis. Thus, ethyne is a linear \nmolecule.9.4.3 Preparation1. From calcium carbide: On industrial scale, ethyne is prepared by treating calcium carbide with water. Calcium carbide is prepared by heating quick lime \nwith coke. Quick lime can be obtained by \nheating limestone as shown in the following  reactions:CaCO3 ∆ CaO + O2 (9.55)Fig. 9.6 Orbital picture of ethyne showing  (a) sigma overlaps (b) pi overlaps.Unit 9.indd   31511/10/2022   15:27:49316CaO + 3C   CaC2 + CO (9.56)  Calcium   carbideCaC2 + 2H2O   Ca(OH)2 + C2H2 (9.57)2. From vicinal dihalides : Vicinal dihalides on treatment with alcoholic potassium hydroxide undergo dehydrohalogenation. \nOne molecule of hydrogen halide is \neliminated to form alkenyl halide which \non treatment with sodamide gives alkyne.9.4.4  PropertiesPhysical propertiesPhysical properties of alkynes follow the same trend of alkenes and alkanes. First three \nmembers are gases, the next eight are liquids \nand the higher ones are solids. All alkynes \nare colourless. Ethyene has characteristic \nodour. Other members are odourless. Alkynes \nare weakly polar in nature. They are lighter \nthan water and immiscible with water but \nsoluble in organic solvents like ethers, carbon \ntetrachloride and benzene. Their  melting \npoint, boiling point and density increase with \nincrease in molar mass.Chemical propertiesAlkynes show acidic nature, addition reactions \nand polymerisation reactions as follows : A. Acidic character of alkyne: Sodium metal and sodamide (NaNH2) are strong bases. They react with ethyne to form sodium acetylide with the liberation of dihydrogen \ngas. These reactions have not been observed \nin case of ethene and ethane thus indicating \nthat ethyne is acidic in nature in comparison \nto ethene and ethane. Why is it so ? Has \nit something to do with their structures \nand the hybridisation ? You have read that hydrogen atoms in ethyne are attached to the sp hybridised carbon atoms whereas they are attached to sp2 hybridised carbon atoms in ethene and sp3 hybridised carbons in ethane. Due to the maximum percentage of s character (50%), the sp hybridised orbitals of carbon atoms in ethyne molecules have  \nhighest electronegativity; hence, these attract \nthe shared electron pair of the C-H bond of \nethyne to a greater extent than that of the \nsp2 hybridised orbitals of carbon in ethene and the sp3 hybridised orbital of carbon in ethane. Thus in ethyne, hydrogen atoms \ncan be liberated as protons more easily as \ncompared to ethene and ethane. Hence, \nhydrogen atoms of ethyne attached to triply \nbonded carbon atom are acidic in nature. You \nmay note that the hydrogen atoms attached \nto the triply bonded carbons are acidic but \nnot all the hydrogen atoms of alkynes.

What \nabout the above reactions with but-1-yne and \nbut-2-yne ? Alkanes, alkenes and alkynes \nfollow the following trend in their acidic \nbehaviour :i) CH ≡ CH \u003e H2C – CH2 \u003e CH3 –CH3ii) HC ≡ CH \u003e CH3 –C≡ CH \u003e\u003e CH3 –C≡C–CH3 B. Addition reactions: Alkynes contain a triple bond, so they add up, two molecules of dihydrogen, halogen, hydrogen halides etc. Formation of the addition product takes place \naccording to the following steps. Unit 9.indd   31610/10/2022   10:37:57 AM317  The addition product formed depends upon stability of vinylic cation. Addition in unsymmetrical alkynes takes place according to Markovnikov rule.

This is used as a test for unsaturation.(iii) Addition of hydrogen halidesTwo molecules of hydrogen halides (HCl, HBr, HI) add to alkynes to form gem dihalides (in which two halogens are attached to the same carbon atom)H–C≡C–H+H–Br  [CH2 = CH–Br]→ CHBr2 Bromoethene  CH31,1-Dibromoethane(9.65)(9.66)(iv)  Addition of waterLike alkanes and alkenes, alkynes are also immiscible and do not react with water. \nHowever, one molecule of water adds to \nalkynes on warming with mercuric sulphate \nand dilute sulphuric acid at 333 K to form \ncarbonyl compounds.(9.67)(9.68)(v) Polymerisation(a) Linear polymerisation: Under suitable conditions, linear polymerisation of ethyne \ntakes place to produce polyacetylene or polyethyne which is a high molecular \nweight polyene containing repeating units of  (CH = CH – CH =  CH ) and can be represented �as —(CH = CH – CH = CH)n— Under special conditions, this polymer conducts electricity. Unit 9.indd   31703-05-2024   16:36:52318Thin film of polyacetylene can be used as electrodes in batteries. These films are good \nconductors, lighter and cheaper than the \nmetal conductors.(b)  Cyclic polymerisation: Ethyne on passing through red hot iron tube at 873K undergoes cyclic polymerization. Three molecules polymerise to form benzene, which \nis the starting molecule for the preparation of \nderivatives of benzene, dyes, drugs and large \nnumber of other organic compounds. This is \nthe best route for entering from aliphatic to \naromatic compounds as discussed below:                                   (9.69)Problem 9.14How will you convert ethanoic acid into benzene?Solution9.5 AROMATIC HYDROCARBONThese hydrocarbons are also known as ‘arenes’. Since most of them possess pleasant odour (Greek; aroma meaning pleasant \nsmelling), the class of compounds was \nnamed as ‘aromatic compounds’. Most of such \ncompounds were found to contain benzene \nring. Benzene ring is highly unsaturated but in a majority of reactions of aromatic \ncompounds, the unsaturation of benzene ring \nis retained. However, there are examples of \naromatic hydrocarbons which do not contain a \nbenzene ring but instead contain other highly \nunsaturated ring.  Aromatic compounds \ncontaining benzene ring are known as \nbenzenoids and those not containing a \nbenzene ring are known as non-benzenoids. \nSome examples of arenes are given  below:    Benzene         Toluene NaphthaleneBiphenyl9.5.1 Nomenclature and IsomerismThe nomenclature and isomerism of aromatic hydrocarbons has already been discussed in Unit 8. All six hydrogen atoms in benzene \nare equivalent; so it forms one and only one \ntype of monosubstituted product. When two \nhydrogen atoms in benzene are replaced by \ntwo similar or different monovalent atoms or \ngroups, three different position isomers are \npossible. The 1, 2 or 1, 6 is known as the ortho (o–), the 1, 3 or 1, 5 as meta (m–) and the 1, 4 as para (p–) disubstituted compounds. A \nfew examples of derivatives of benzene are \ngiven below: Methylbenzene 1,2-Dimethylbenzene (Toluene)  (o-Xylene)Unit 9.indd   31811/10/2022   15:28:313191,3 Dimethylbenzene 1,4-Dimethylbenzene (m-Xylene)              ( p-Xylene)9.5.2 Structure of BenzeneBenzene was isolated by Michael Faraday in 1825. The molecular formula of benzene, \nC6H6, indicates a high degree of unsaturation. This molecular formula did not account for \nits relationship to corresponding alkanes, \nalkenes and alkynes which you have studied \nin earlier sections of this unit. What do you \nthink about its possible structure? Due to \nits unique properties and unusual stability, \nit took several years to assign its structure. \nBenzene was found to be a stable molecule \nand found to form a triozonide which indicates \nthe presence of three double bonds. Benzene was further found to produce one and only one monosubstituted derivative which indicated \nthat all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms \nof benzene are identical. On the basis of this \nobservation August Kekulé in 1865 proposed \nthe following structure for benzene having \ncyclic arrangement of six carbon atoms with \nalternate single and double bonds and one \nhydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom.  The Kekulé structure indicates the possibility of two isomeric  1, 2-dibromobenzenes. In one of the isomers, the bromine atoms are attached to the \ndoubly bonded carbon atoms whereas in the \nother, they are attached to the singly bonded carbons.Friedrich August Kekulé,a German chemist was born in 1829 at Darmsdt in Germany. He became Professor in 1856 and Fellow of Royal Society in 1875. He \nmade major contribution to structural organic chemistry by proposing in 1858 that \ncarbon atoms can join to one another to form chains and later in 1865,he found \nan answer to the challenging problem of benzene structure by suggesting that \nthese chains can close to form rings. He gave the dynamic structural  formula to \nbenzene which forms the basis for its modern electronic structure. He described \nthe discovery of benzene structure later as: “I was sitting writing at my textbook,but the work did not progress; my thoughts were elsewhere. I turned my chair to the fire, and dozed. Again the atoms were \ngambolling before my eyes. This time the smaller groups kept modestly in the \nbackground. My mental eye, rendered more acute by repeated visions of this \nkind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold  conformations; long \nrows,sometimes more closely fitted together; all twisting and turning in snake like motion. But look! What \nwas that? One of the snakes had seized hold of it’s own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my \neyes. As if by a flash of lightning I woke;.... I spent the rest of the night working out the consequences of \nthe hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth but let us \nbeware of making our dreams public before they have been approved by the waking mind.”( 1890). One hundred years later, on the occasion of Kekulé’s centenary celebrations a group of compounds having polybenzenoid structures have been named as Kekulenes. FRIEDRICH AUGUST KEKULÉ(7th September 1829–13th July 1896)Unit 9.indd   31910/10/2022   10:37:58 AM320  However, benzene was found to form only one ortho disubstituted product. This problem was overcome by Kekulé by suggesting the concept of oscillating nature of double bonds \nin benzene as given below. Even with this modification, Kekulé structure of benzene  fails to explain unusual \nstability and preference to substitution  reactions than addition reactions, which \ncould later on be explained by resonance.Resonance and stability of benzeneAccording to Valence Bond Theory, the concept of oscillating double bonds in benzene \nis now explained by resonance. Benzene is a \nhybrid of various resonating structures. The \ntwo structures, A and B given by Kekulé  are the main contributing structures. The hybrid \nstructure is represented by inserting a circle \nor a dotted circle in the hexagon as shown \nin (C). The circle represents the six electrons \nwhich are delocalised between the six carbon \natoms of the benzene ring.   (A)     (B)                               (C) The orbital overlapping gives us better picture about the structure of benzene. All the six carbon atoms in benzene are sp2 hybridized. Two sp2 hybrid orbitals of each carbon atom overlap with sp2 hybrid orbitals of adjacent carbon atoms to form six C—C sigma bonds which are in the hexagonal \nplane. The remaining sp2 hybrid orbital of each carbon atom overlaps with s orbital of a hydrogen atom to form six C—H sigma bonds. Each carbon atom is now left with one unhybridised p orbital perpendicular to the plane of the ring as shown below: The unhybridised p orbital of carbon atoms are close enough to form a π bond by lateral overlap. There are two equal possibilities of \nforming three π bonds by overlap of p orbitals of C1 –C2, C3  – C4, C5  – C6 or C2  – C3, C4  – C5, C6  – C1 respectively as shown in the following figures.Fig. 9.7 (a)Fig. 9.7 (b) Structures shown in Fig. 9.7(a) and (b) correspond to two Kekulé’s structure with localised π bonds. The internuclear distance Unit 9.indd   32011/10/2022   15:29:07321between all the carbon atoms in the ring has been determined by the X-ray diffraction to \nbe the same; there is equal probability for the \np orbital of each carbon atom to overlap with \nthe p orbitals of adjacent carbon atoms [Fig. 9.7 (c)]. This can be represented in the form \nof two doughtnuts (rings) of electron clouds \n[Fig. 9.7 (d)], one above and one below the \nplane of the hexagonal ring as shown below: Fig. 9.7 (c)                    Fig. 9.7 (d) The six π electrons are thus delocalised and can move freely about the six carbon nuclei, instead of any two as shown in  Fig. 9.6 (a) or (b). The delocalised π electron cloud is attracted more strongly by the nuclei of the \ncarbon atoms than the electron cloud localised \nbetween two carbon atoms. Therefore, presence \nof delocalised π electrons in benzene makes it more stable than the hypothetical \ncyclohexatriene. X-Ray diffraction data reveals that benzene is a planar molecule. Had any one of the above structures of benzene (A or B) been correct, two types of C—C bond lengths were expected. \nHowever, X-ray data indicates that all the \nsix C—C bond lengths are of the same order  (139 pm) which is  intermediate between  C— C single bond (154 pm) and C—C double \nbond (133 pm). Thus the absence of pure \ndouble bond in benzene accounts for the \nreluctance of benzene to show addition \nreactions under normal conditions, thus explaining the unusual behaviour of benzene.9.5.3 AromaticityBenzene was considered as parent ‘aromatic’ compound. Now, the name is applied to all the \nring systems whether or not having benzene \nring, possessing following characteristics.(i) Planarity(ii) Complete delocalisation of the π electrons \nin the ring(iii) Presence of (4n + 2) π electrons in the ring where n is an integer (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .).  This is often referred to as Hückel Rule.Some examples of aromatic compounds are given below:           9.5.4 Preparation of BenzeneBenzene is commercially isolated from coal \ntar. However, it may be prepared in the laboratory by the following methods.(i) Cyclic polymerisation of ethyne: (Section 9.4.4)(ii) Decarboxylation of aromatic acids: Sodium salt of benzoic acid on heating \nwith sodalime gives benzene.(9.70)(electron cloud)Unit 9.indd   32110/27/2022   2:18:31 PM322(iii) Reduction of phenol: Phenol is reduced to benzene by passing its vapours over heated zinc dust  (9.71)9.5.5 PropertiesPhysical properties Aromatic hydrocarbons are non- polar  molecules and are usually colourless liquids \nor solids with a characteristic aroma. You are \nalso familiar with naphthalene balls which are \nused in toilets and for preservation of clothes \nbecause of unique smell of the compound \nand the moth repellent property. Aromatic \nhydrocarbons are immiscible with water but \nare readily miscible with organic solvents. \nThey burn with sooty flame.Chemical properties Arenes are characterised by electrophilic \nsubstitution reactions. However, under \nspecial conditions they can also undergo \naddition and oxidation reactions.Electrophilic substitution reactionsThe common electrophilic substitution \nreactions of arenes are nitration, halogenation, \nsulphonation, Friedel Craft’s alkylation and \nacylation reactions in which attacking reagent \nis an electrophile (E+)(i) Nitration: A nitro group is introduced into benzene ring when benzene is heated \nwith a mixture of concentrated nitric acid \nand concentrated sulphuric acid (nitrating \nmixture). (9.72)               Nitrobenzene(ii) Halogenation: Arenes react with halogens in the presence of a Lewis acid like anhydrous FeCl3, FeBr3 or AlCl3 to yield haloarenes.Chlorobenzene (9.73)(iii) Sulphonation: The replacement of a hydrogen atom by a sulphonic acid group in a ring is called sulphonation. It is carried out \nby heating benzene with fuming sulphuric \nacid (oleum).(9.74)(iv) Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction: When benzene is treated with an alkyl halide \nin the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride, alkylbenene is formed. (9.75) (9.76) Why do we get isopropyl benzene on treating benzene with 1-chloropropane instead of n-propyl benzene?(v) Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction: The reaction of benzene with an acyl halide or acid anhydride in the presence of Lewis acids (AlCl3) yields acyl benzene.Unit 9.indd   32212/13/2022   10:16:03323(9.77) (9.78) If excess of electrophilic reagent is used, further substitution reaction may take place in which other hydrogen atoms of benzene \nring may also be successively replaced by the electrophile. For example, benzene \non treatment with excess of chlorine in \nthe presence of anhydrous AlCl3 can be chlorinated to hexachlorobenzene (C6Cl6)   (9.79)Mechanism of electrophilic substitution \nreactions:\nAccording to experimental evidences, SE (S = substitution; E = electrophilic) reactions are supposed to proceed via the following three \nsteps:(a) Generation of the eletrophile (b) Formation of carbocation intermediate(c) Removal of proton from the carbocation intermediate(a) Generation of electrophile E⊕: During chlorination, alkylation and acylation of \nbenzene, anhydrous AlCl3, being a Lewis acid helps in generation of the elctrophile Cl⊕, R⊕, RC⊕O (acylium ion) respectively by combining with the attacking reagent.  In the case of nitration, the electrophile, nitronium ion,  is produced by transfer of a proton (from sulphuric acid) to nitric acid in the following manner:Step I Step II Protonated Nitronium nitric acid ion It is interesting to note that in the process of generation of nitronium ion, sulphuric acid serves as an acid and nitric acid as a base. \nThus, it is a simple acid-base equilibrium.(b) Formation of Carbocation   (arenium ion): Attack of electrophile results in the formation of σ-complex or arenium ion in which one of the carbon is sp3 hybridised.   sigma complex (arenium ion) The arenium ion  gets stabilised by resonance:Unit 9.indd   32312/1/2022   11:04:17324 Sigma complex or arenium ion loses its aromatic character because delocalisation of electrons stops at sp3 hybridised carbon.(c)  Removal of proton: To restore the aromatic character, σ -complex releases proton from sp3 hybridised carbon on attack by [AlCl4]– (in case of halogenation, alkylation and acylation) and [HSO4]– (in case of nitration).Addition reactions\nUnder  vigorous conditions, i.e., at high \ntemperature and/ or pressure in the presence \nof nickel catalyst, hydrogenation of benzene \ngives cyclohexane.   Cyclohexane(9.80) Under ultra-violet light, three chlorine molecules add to benzene to produce benzene hexachloride, C6H6Cl6 which is also called gammaxane.Benzene hexachloride,       (BHC)(9.81)Combustion: When heated in air, benzene burns with sooty flame producing CO2 and H2O6222615CHO26CO+3HO+→ (9.82)General combustion reaction for any hydrocarbon may be given by the following chemical equation:CxHy + (x + ) O2 → x CO2 +  H2O  n (9.83)9.5.6 Directive influence of a functional group in monosubstituted benzeneWhen monosubstituted benzene is subjected to further substitution, three possible disubstituted products are not formed in \nequal amounts. Two types of behaviour are \nobserved. Either ortho and para products or \nmeta product is predominantly formed. It has also been observed that this behaviour \ndepends on the nature of the substituent \nalready present in the benzene ring and not \non the nature of the entering group. This is \nknown as directive influence of substituents. \nReasons for ortho/para or meta directive nature of groups are discussed below:Ortho and para directing groups: The groups which direct the incoming group to ortho and para positions are called ortho and para directing groups. As an example, let us \ndiscuss the directive influence of phenolic  (–OH) group. Phenol is resonance hybrid of following structures:It is clear from the above resonating structures that the electron density is more on o – and p – positions. Hence, the substitution takes place mainly at these positions. However, �it may be noted that –I effect of – OH group also \noperates due to which the electron density on \northo and para positions of the benzene ring is slightly reduced. But the overall electron \ndensity increases at  these positions of the �ring due to resonance. Therefore, –OH group activates the benzene ring for the attack by Unit 9.indd   32410/10/2022   10:38:01 AM325an electrophile. Other examples of activating groups are –NH2, –NHR, –NHCOCH3, –OCH3,  –CH3, –C2H5, etc.In the case of aryl halides, halogens are moderately deactivating. Because of their  strong – I effect, overall electron density on \nbenzene ring decreases. It makes further \nsubstitution difficult. However, due to \nresonance the electron density on o– and p– positions is greater than that at the m-position. Hence, they are also o– and p– directing groups. Resonance structures of \nchlorobenzene are given below:In this case, the overall electron density on benzene ring decreases making further \nsubstitution difficult, therefore these groups \nare also called ‘deactivating groups’. The \nelectron density on o– and p– position is comparatively less than that at meta position. Hence, the electrophile attacks on \ncomparatively electron rich meta position \nresulting in meta substitution.9.6 CARCINOGENICITY AND TOXICITYBenzene and polynuclear hydrocarbons containing more than two benzene rings fused together are toxic and said to \npossess cancer producing (carcinogenic) \nproperty. Such polynuclear hydrocarbons \nare formed on incomplete combustion of \norganic materials like tobacco, coal and \npetroleum. They enter into human body \nand undergo various biochemical reactions \nand finally damage DNA and cause cancer. \nSome of the carcinogenic hydrocarbons are \ngiven below (see box).Meta directing group: The groups which direct the incoming group to meta position are called meta directing groups. Some examples of meta directing groups are –NO2, –CN, –CHO, –COR, –COOH, –COOR, –SO3H, etc.  Let us take the example of nitro group. Nitro group reduces the electron density in �the benzene ring due to its strong–I effect. \nNitrobenzene is a resonance hybrid of the \nfollowing structures.Unit 9.indd   32510/10/2022   10:38:01 AM326SUMMARYHydrocarbons are the compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons are mainly obtained from coal and petroleum, which are the major sources of energy. Petrochemicals are the prominent starting materials used for the manufacture of a large number of \ncommercially important products. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and  CNG (compressed \nnatural gas), the main sources of energy for domestic fuels and the automobile industry, are \nobtained from petroleum. Hydrocarbons are classified as open chain saturated (alkanes) and unsaturated (alkenes and alkynes), cyclic (alicyclic) and aromatic, according to their structure. The important reactions of alkanes are free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation and aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly electrophilic additions. Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo mainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under special conditions. Alkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C–C sigma bonds. Out of staggered and the eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation is more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical  (cis-trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon–carbon double bond. Benzene and benzenoid compounds show aromatic character. Aromaticity, the property of being aromatic is possessed by compounds having specific electronic structure \ncharacterised by Hückel (4n+2)π electron rule. The nature of groups or substituents attached to benzene ring is responsible for activation or deactivation of the benzene ring towards \nfurther electrophilic substitution and also for orientation of the incoming group. Some of \nthe polynuclear hydrocarbons having fused benzene ring system have carcinogenic property.

    "input": "235Chemistry deals with varieties of matter and change of one kind of matter into the other. Transformation of matter from one kind into another occurs through the \nvarious types of reactions. One important category of such \nreactions is Redox Reactions. A number of phenomena, \nboth physical as well as biological, are concerned with \nredox reactions. These reactions find extensive use in \npharmaceutical, biological, industrial, metallurgical and \nagricultural areas. The importance of these reactions is \napparent from the fact that burning of different types of \nfuels for obtaining energy for domestic, transport and \nother commercial purposes, electrochemical processes \nfor extraction of highly reactive metals and non-metals, \nmanufacturing of  chemical  compounds like  caustic \nsoda, operation of dry and wet batteries and corrosion of \nmetals fall within the purview of redox processes. Of late, \nenvironmental issues like Hydrogen Economy (use of liquid hydrogen as fuel) and development of ‘Ozone Hole’ have started figuring under redox phenomenon. 7.1\tCLASSICAL\tIDEA\tOF\tREDOX\tREACTIONS\t–\t\tOXIDATION AND REDUCTION REACTIONSOriginally, the term oxidation was used to describe the addition of oxygen to an element or a compound. Because of the presence of dioxygen in the atmosphere (~20%), \nmany elements combine with it and this is the principal \nreason why they commonly occur on the earth in the  form of their oxides. The following reactions represent \noxidation processes according to the limited definition of \noxidation: \n2 Mg (s)  +  O2 (g)  →  2 MgO (s) (7.1)S (s) + O2 (g)  →  SO2 (g) (7.2)After studying this unit you will be \nable to • identify redox reactions as a class of reactions in which oxidation and reduction reactions occur \nsimultaneously; • define the terms oxidation, \nreduction, oxidant (oxidising agent) and reductant (reducing \nagent); • explain mechanism of redox \nreactions by electron transfer process;• use  the concept of oxidation \nnumber to identify oxidant and \nreductant in a reaction;• classify redox reaction into combination (synthesis), \ndecomposition, displacement \nand disproportionation \nreactions; • suggest a comparative order \namong various reductants and \noxidants; • balance chemical equations using (i) oxidation number  (ii) half reaction method;• learn the concept of redox \nreactions in terms of electrode processes.UNIT 7REDOX REACTIONSWhere there is oxidation, there is always reduction –  Chemistry is essentially a study of redox systems.Unit 7.indd   23510/10/2022   10:37:02 AM236In reactions (7.1) and (7.2), the elements magnesium and sulphur are oxidised on account of addition of oxygen to them. \nSimilarly,  methane is oxidised owing to the \naddition of oxygen to it.CH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (l) (7.3)A careful examination of reaction (7.3) in which hydrogen has been replaced by oxygen prompted chemists to reinterpret oxidation \nin terms of removal of hydrogen from it and, \ntherefore, the scope of term oxidation was \nbroadened to include the removal of hydrogen \nfrom a substance. The following illustration is \nanother reaction where removal of hydrogen \ncan also be cited as an oxidation reaction. 2 H2S(g) + O2 (g) → 2 S (s) + 2 H2O (l) (7.4)As knowledge of chemists grew, it was natural to extend the term oxidation for reactions similar to (7.1 to 7.4), which do not involve oxygen but other electronegative \nelements. The oxidation of magnesium with \nfluorine, chlorine and sulphur etc. occurs \naccording to the following reactions : Mg (s) + F2 (g) → MgF2 (s) (7.5)Mg (s) + Cl2 (g) → MgCl2 (s) (7.6)Mg (s) + S (s) → MgS (s) (7.7)Incorporating the reactions (7.5 to 7.7) within the fold of oxidation reactions  encouraged chemists to consider not only the removal of hydrogen as oxidation, but \nalso the removal of electropositive elements \nas oxidation. Thus the reaction : 2K4 [Fe(CN)6](aq) + H2O2 (aq) →2K3[Fe(CN)6](aq) + 2 KOH (aq)is interpreted as oxidation due to the removal \nof electropositive element potassium from \npotassium ferrocyanide before it changes to \npotassium ferricyanide. To summarise, the \nterm “oxidation” is defined as the addition of oxygen/electronegative element to \na substance or removal of hydrogen/\nelectropositive element from a substance.In the beginning, reduction was considered as removal of oxygen from a compound. \nHowever, the term reduction has been broadened these days to include removal of oxygen/electronegative element from \na substance or addition of hydrogen/\nelectropositive element to a substance. According to the definition given above, the following are the examples of reduction \nprocesses:2 HgO (s)   2 Hg (l) + O2 (g) (7.8)(removal of oxygen from mercuric oxide )2 FeCl3 (aq) + H2 (g) →2 FeCl2 (aq) + 2 HCl(aq)(7.9)(removal of electronegative element, chlorine from ferric chloride)CH2 = CH2 (g) + H2 (g) → H3C – CH3 (g) (7.10)(addition of hydrogen)\n2HgCl2 (aq) + SnCl2 (aq) → Hg2Cl2 (s)+SnCl4 (aq)(7.11)(addition of mercury to mercuric chloride)In reaction (7.11) simultaneous oxidation of stannous chloride to stannic chloride is also occurring because of the addition of \nelectronegative element chlorine to it. It was \nsoon realised that oxidation and reduction \nalways occur simultaneously (as will be \napparent by re-examining all the equations \ngiven above), hence, the word “redox” was \ncoined for this class of chemical reactions. Problem 7.1In the reactions given below, identify the species undergoing oxidation and \nreduction: (i)  H2S (g) + Cl2 (g) → 2 HCl (g) + S (s)(ii) 3Fe3O4 (s) + 8 Al (s) → 9 Fe (s)                                                  + 4Al2O3 (s)(iii) 2 Na (s) + H2 (g) → 2 NaH (s)Solution  \n(i) H2S is oxidised because a more electronegative element, chlorine is added to hydrogen (or a more electropositive \nelement, hydrogen has been removed  from S). Chlorine is reduced due to \naddition of hydrogen to it.(ii)  Aluminium is oxidised because oxygen is added to it. Ferrous ferric oxide Unit 7.indd   23610/10/2022   10:37:03 AM237(Fe3O4) is reduced because oxygen has been removed from it. (iii)  With the careful application of the concept of electronegativity only we \nmay infer that sodium is oxidised and \nhydrogen is reduced. Reaction (iii) chosen here prompts us to think in terms of another way to define \nredox reactions. 7.2 REDOX REACTIONS IN TERMS OF \nELECTRON  TRANSFER REACTIONSWe have already learnt that the reactions 2Na(s) + Cl2(g) →  2NaCl (s) (7.12)4Na(s) + O2(g) →  2Na2O(s) (7.13)2Na(s) + S(s) →  Na2S(s) (7.14)are redox reactions because in each of these \nreactions sodium is oxidised due to the addition of either oxygen or more electronegative \nelement to sodium. Simultaneously, chlorine, \noxygen and sulphur are reduced because to \neach of these, the electropositive element \nsodium has been added. From our knowledge \nof chemical bonding we also know that sodium \nchloride, sodium oxide and sodium sulphide \nare ionic compounds and perhaps better \nwritten as Na+Cl– (s), (Na+)2O2–(s), and (Na+)2 S2–(s). Development of charges on the species produced suggests us to rewrite the reactions \n(7.12 to 7.14) in the following manner : For convenience, each of the above processes can be considered as two separate \nsteps, one involving the loss of electrons \nand the other the gain of electrons. As an \nillustration, we may further elaborate one of \nthese, say, the formation of  sodium chloride. 2 Na(s) → 2 Na+(g)   +   2e–Cl2(g) + 2e– → 2 Cl–(g)Each of the above steps is called a half reaction, which explicitly shows involvement of electrons. Sum of the half reactions gives \nthe overall reaction : 2 Na(s) + Cl2 (g)  → 2 Na+ Cl– (s) or 2 NaCl (s)Reactions 7.12 to 7.14 suggest that half reactions that involve loss of electrons are \ncalled oxidation reactions. Similarly, the \nhalf reactions that involve gain of electrons \nare called reduction reactions.  It may not \nbe out of context to mention here that the \nnew way of defining oxidation and reduction \nhas been achieved only by establishing a \ncorrelation between the behaviour of species \nas per the classical idea and their interplay \nin electron-transfer change. In reactions (7.12 \nto 7.14) sodium, which is oxidised, acts as  a reducing agent because it donates electron \nto each of the elements interacting with it and \nthus helps in reducing them. Chlorine, oxygen \nand sulphur are reduced and act as oxidising \nagents because these accept electrons from \nsodium. To summarise, we may mention that Oxidation : Loss of electron(s) by any species.\nReduction : Gain of electron(s) by any species.Oxidising agent : Acceptor of electron(s).\nReducing agent : Donor of electron(s).Problem 7.2  Justify that the reaction:\n2 Na(s) + H2(g) →  2 NaH (s) is a redox change.\nSolution\nSince in the above reaction the compound formed is an ionic compound, which may \nalso be represented as Na+H– (s), this suggests that one half reaction in this \nprocess is : 2 Na (s) → 2 Na+(g)  +   2e–Unit 7.indd   23710/10/2022   10:37:03 AM238and the other half reaction is: H2 (g) + 2e– →  2 H–(g)This splitting of the reaction under examination into two half reactions \nautomatically reveals that here sodium \nis oxidised and hydrogen is reduced, \ntherefore, the complete reaction is a \nredox change. 7.2.1 Competitive Electron Transfer \nReactionsPlace a strip of metallic zinc in an aqueous \nsolution of copper nitrate as shown in Fig. \n7.1, for about one hour. You may notice that the  strip becomes coated with reddish \nmetallic copper and the blue colour of the \nsolution disappears. Formation of  Zn2+ ions among the products can easily be  judged \nwhen the blue colour of the solution due to \nCu2+ has disappeared. If hydrogen sulphide gas is passed through the colourless solution \ncontaining Zn2+ ions, appearance of white zinc sulphide, ZnS can be seen on making the \nsolution alkaline with ammonia. The reaction between metallic zinc and the aqueous solution of copper nitrate is : Zn(s) + Cu2+ (aq) → Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)     (7.15)In reaction (7.15), zinc has lost electrons to form Zn2+ and, therefore, zinc is oxidised. Evidently, now if zinc is oxidised, releasing electrons, something must be reduced, \naccepting the electrons lost by zinc. Copper \nion is reduced by gaining electrons from the zinc. Reaction (7.15) may be rewritten as : At this stage we may investigate the state of equilibrium for the reaction represented by \nequation (7.15). For this purpose, let us place \na strip of metallic copper in a zinc sulphate \nsolution. No visible reaction is noticed and \nattempt to detect the presence of Cu2+ ions by passing H2S gas through the solution to produce the black colour of cupric sulphide, \nCuS, does not succeed. Cupric sulphide has \nsuch a low solubility that this is an extremely \nsensitive test; yet the amount of Cu2+ formed cannot be detected. We thus conclude that \nthe state of equilibrium for the reaction (7.15) \ngreatly favours the products over the reactants. Let us extend electron transfer reaction now to copper metal and silver nitrate solution \nin water and arrange a set-up as shown in  Fig. 7.2. The solution develops blue colour \ndue to the formation of Cu2+ ions on account of the reaction:Fig. 7.1  Redox reaction between zinc and aqueous solution of copper nitrate occurring in a beaker.(7.16)Here, Cu(s) is oxidised to Cu2+(aq) and  Ag+(aq) is reduced to Ag(s). Equilibrium greatly favours the products Cu2+ (aq) and Ag(s).By way of contrast, let us also compare the reaction of metallic cobalt placed in nickel \nsulphate solution. The reaction that occurs \nhere is : (7.17)Unit 7.indd   23811/11/2022   09:48:49239Fig. 7.2  Redox reaction between copper and aqueous solution of silver nitrate occurring in a beaker. At equilibrium, chemical tests reveal that both Ni2+(aq) and Co2+(aq)  are present at moderate concentrations. In this case, neither the \nreactants [Co(s) and Ni2+(aq)] nor the products [Co2+(aq) and Ni (s)] are greatly favoured. This competition for release of electrons incidently reminds us of the competition for \nrelease of  protons among acids.  The similarity \nsuggests that we might develop a table in \nwhich metals and their ions are listed  on the \nbasis of their tendency to release electrons \njust as we do in the case of acids to indicate \nthe strength of the acids. As a matter of fact \nwe have already made certain comparisons. \nBy comparison we have come to know that \nzinc releases electrons to copper and copper \nreleases electrons to silver and, therefore, \nthe electron releasing tendency of the metals \nis in the order: Zn\u003eCu\u003eAg. We would love to \nmake our list more vast and design a metal \nactivity series or electrochemical series. \nThe competition for electrons between various \nmetals helps us to design a class of cells, \nnamed as Galvanic cells in which the chemical \nreactions become the source of electrical \nenergy. We would study more about these \ncells in Class XII.7.3 OXIDATION NUMBERA less obvious example of electron transfer is realised when hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water by the reaction:2H2(g) + O2 (g) →  2H2O (l)      (7.18)Though not simple in its approach, yet we can visualise the H atom as going from a neutral (zero) state in H2 to a positive state in H2O, the O atom goes from a zero state in O2 to a dinegative state in H2O. It is assumed that there is an electron transfer from H to O and consequently H2 is oxidised and O2 is reduced. However, as we shall see later, the charge transfer is only partial and is perhaps better \ndescribed as an electron shift rather than a \ncomplete loss of electron by H and gain by \nO. What has been said here with respect \nto equation (7.18) may be true for a good \nnumber of other reactions involving covalent \ncompounds. Two such examples of this class \nof the reactions are:H2(s) + Cl2(g)   →  2HCl(g)     (7.19)and,\nCH 4(g)  +  4Cl2(g)  → CCl4(l)  + 4HCl(g)    (7.20)In order to keep track of electron shifts in chemical reactions involving formation of covalent compounds, a more practical \nmethod of using oxidation number has \nbeen developed. In this method, it is always \nassumed that there is a complete transfer \nof electron from a less electronegative atom \nto a more electonegative atom. For example, \nwe rewrite equations (7.18 to 7.20) to show \ncharge on each of the atoms forming part of \nthe reaction :   0           0              +1 –22H2(g) + O2(g) →  2H2O (l) (7.21)0            0            +1 –1H2 (s) + Cl2(g) →  2HCl(g) (7.22)–4+1          0          +4 –1        +1 –1 CH4(g)  + 4Cl2(g) →  CCl4(l)  +4HCl(g) (7.23)It may be emphasised that the assumption of electron transfer is made for book-keeping \npurpose only and it will become obvious at \na later stage in this unit that it leads to the simple description of redox reactions. Oxidation number denotes the oxidation state of an element in a compound \nascertained according to a set of rules \nformulated on the basis that electron pair Unit 7.indd   23911/10/2022   15:18:03240in a covalent bond belongs entirely to more electronegative element. It is not always possible to remember or make out easily in a compound/ion, which \nelement is more electronegative than the \nother. Therefore, a set of rules has been \nformulated to determine the oxidation \nnumber of an element in a compound/ion. \nIf two or more than two atoms of an element \nare present in the molecule/ion such as \nNa2S2O3/Cr2O7 2–, the oxidation number of the atom of that element will then be the average \nof the oxidation number of all the atoms of \nthat element. We may at this stage, state the \nrules for the calculation of oxidation number. \nThese rules are: 1. In elements, in the free or the uncombined state, each atom bears an oxidation \nnumber of zero. Evidently each atom in H2, O2, Cl2, O3, P4, S8, Na, Mg, Al has the oxidation number zero. 2. For ions composed of only one atom, the \noxidation number is equal to the charge \non the ion. Thus Na+ ion has an oxidation number of +1, Mg2+ ion, +2, Fe3+ ion, +3, Cl– ion, –1, O2– ion, –2; and so on. In their compounds all alkali metals have oxidation \nnumber of +1, and all alkaline earth metals \nhave an oxidation number of +2. Aluminium \nis regarded to have an oxidation number of \n+3 in all its compounds. 3. The oxidation number of oxygen in most compounds is –2. However, we come across two kinds of exceptions here. \nOne arises in the case of peroxides and \nsuperoxides, the compounds of oxygen in \nwhich oxygen atoms are directly linked to \neach other. While in peroxides (e.g., H2O2, Na2O2), each oxygen atom is assigned an oxidation number of –1, in superoxides \n(e.g., KO2, RbO2) each oxygen atom is assigned an oxidation number of –(½). \nThe second exception appears rarely, i.e. \nwhen oxygen is bonded to fluorine. In \nsuch compounds e.g., oxygen difluoride \n(OF2) and dioxygen difluoride (O2F2), the oxygen is assigned an oxidation number \nof +2 and +1, respectively. The number \nassigned to oxygen will depend upon the bonding state of oxygen but this number would now be a positive figure only. 4. The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1, \nexcept when it is bonded to metals in binary \ncompounds (that is compounds containing two elements). For example, in LiH, NaH, \nand CaH2, its oxidation number is –1. 5. In all its compounds, fluorine has an �oxidation number of –1. Other halogens (Cl, Br, and I) also have an oxidation number �of –1, when they occur as halide ions in \ntheir compounds. Chlorine, bromine and \niodine when combined with oxygen, for \nexample in oxoacids and oxoanions, have \npositive oxidation numbers. 6. The algebraic sum of the oxidation number \nof all the atoms in a compound must be \nzero. In polyatomic ion, the algebraic sum of all the oxidation numbers of atoms of \nthe ion must equal the charge on the ion. \nThus, the sum of oxidation number of three \noxygen atoms and one carbon atom in the \ncarbonate ion, (CO3)2– must equal –2. By the application of above rules, we can find out the oxidation number of the desired \nelement in a molecule or in an ion. It is clear \nthat the metallic elements have positive \noxidation number and nonmetallic elements \nhave positive or negative oxidation number. \nThe atoms of transition elements usually \ndisplay several positive oxidation states. The \nhighest oxidation number of a representative \nelement is the group number for the first \ntwo groups and the group number minus 10 \n(following the long form of periodic table) for \nthe other groups. Thus, it implies that the \nhighest value of oxidation number exhibited \nby an atom of an element generally increases \nacross the period in the periodic table. In the \nthird period, the highest value of oxidation \nnumber changes from 1 to 7 as indicated \nbelow in the compounds of the elements.A term that is often used interchangeably with the oxidation number is the oxidation \nstate. Thus in CO2, the oxidation state of carbon is +4, that is also its oxidation number \nand similarly the oxidation state as well �as oxidation number of oxygen is – 2. This \nimplies that the oxidation number denotes the oxidation state of an element in a compound. Unit 7.indd   24010/10/2022   10:37:04 AM241The oxidation number/state of a metal in a compound is sometimes presented according \nto the notation given by German chemist, \nAlfred Stock. It is popularly known as Stock \nnotation. According to this, the oxidation number is expressed by putting a Roman \nnumeral representing the oxidation number \nin parenthesis after the symbol of the metal in \nthe molecular formula. Thus aurous chloride \nand auric chloride are written as Au(I)Cl and \nAu(III)Cl3. Similarly, stannous chloride and stannic chloride are written as Sn(II)Cl2 and Sn(IV)Cl4. This change in oxidation number implies change in oxidation state, which in \nturn helps to identify whether the species \nis present in oxidised form or reduced form. Thus, Hg2(I)Cl2 is the reduced form of Hg(II) Cl2. Problem 7.3Using Stock notation, represent the following compounds :HAuCl4, Tl2O, FeO,   Fe2O3, CuI, CuO, MnO and MnO2.    Solution By applying various rules of calculating the oxidation number of the desired \nelement in a compound, the oxidation \nnumber of each metallic element in its \ncompound is as follows:HAuCl4  → Au has 3Tl2O → Tl has 1FeO → Fe has 2Fe2O3 → Fe has 3 CuI → Cu has 1CuO → Cu has 2MnO → Mn has 2MnO2 → Mn has 4Therefore, these compounds may be represented as:HAu(III)Cl4, Tl2(I)O, Fe(II)O, Fe2(III)O3, Cu(I)I, Cu(II)O, Mn(II)O, Mn(IV)O2.The idea of oxidation number has been invariably applied to define oxidation, \nreduction, oxidising agent (oxidant), reducing \nagent (reductant) and the redox reaction. To \nsummarise, we may say that:Oxidation: An increase in the oxidation number of the element in the given substance. Reduction  : A decrease in the oxidation number of the element in the given substance.\nOxidising agent: A reagent which can increase the oxidation number of an element in a given substance. These reagents are \ncalled as oxidants also.Reducing agent: A reagent which lowers the oxidation number of an element in a given substance. These reagents are also called as \nreductants.Redox reactions: Reactions which involve change in oxidation number of the interacting species.Problem 7.4Justify that the reaction:\n2Cu2O(s) + Cu2S(s)  →   6Cu(s) + SO2(g)is a redox reaction. Identify the species oxidised/reduced, which acts as an \noxidant and which acts as a reductant.SolutionLet us assign oxidation number to each of the species in the reaction under \nexamination. This results into:  +1  –2        +1  –2          0        +4 –22Cu2O(s) + Cu2S(s)  →  6Cu(s) + SO2We therefore, conclude that in this \nreaction copper is reduced from  +1 state to zero oxidation state and sulphur is \noxidised from –2 state to +4 state. The \nabove reaction is thus a redox reaction.

Combination reactions A combination reaction may be denoted in the manner:A + B  →   CEither A and B or both A and B must be in \nthe elemental form for such a reaction to be \na redox reaction. All combustion reactions, \nwhich make use of elemental dioxygen, as well \nas other reactions involving elements other \nthan dioxygen, are redox reactions. Some \nimportant examples of this category are:0           0              +4 –2C(s)  +  O2 (g)      CO2(g) (7.24)   0       0       +2  –33Mg(s) + N2(g)    Mg3N2(s) (7.25)–4+1           0            +4 –2               +1 –2CH4(g)  +  2O2(g)  CO2(g)   +    2H2O (l)2. Decomposition reactions Decomposition reactions are the opposite of combination reactions. Precisely, a \ndecomposition reaction leads to the breakdown \nof a compound into two or more components \nat least one of which must be in the elemental \nstate. Examples of this class of reactions are:+1 –2         0           02H2O (l)    2H2 (g) + O2(g) (7.26)+1 –1                    0            02NaH (s)     2Na (s) + H2(g) (7.27)+1 +5 –2                 +1 –1           02KClO3 (s)     2KCl (s)  + 3O2(g) (7.28)It may carefully be noted that there is no change in the oxidation number of hydrogen in methane under combination reactions \nand that of potassium in potassium chlorate \nin reaction (7.28). This may also be noted here that all decomposition reactions are not redox reactions. For example, decomposition of calcium carbonate is not a redox reaction.+2 +4 –2  +2 –2           +4 –2CaCO3 (s)      CaO(s)    +    CO2(g) 3. Displacement reactions In a displacement reaction, an ion (or an atom) in a compound is replaced by an ion (or an atom) of another element. It may be \ndenoted as: X  + YZ  →  XZ  + Y Displacement reactions fit into two \ncategories: metal displacement and non-metal \ndisplacement.(a) Metal displacement: A metal in a compound can be displaced by another metal in the uncombined state. We have already \ndiscussed about this class of the reactions \nunder section 7.2.1. Metal displacement \nreactions find many applications in \nmetallurgical processes in which pure metals \nare obtained from their compounds in ores. A \nfew such examples are:+2+6–2     0   0        +2 +6 –2CuSO4(aq) + Zn (s) → Cu(s) + ZnSO4 (aq)              (7.29)+5 –2            0   0      +2 –2V2O5 (s) + 5Ca (s)    2V (s) + 5CaO (s)            (7.30)+4 –1           0         0             +2 –1TiCl4 (l) + 2Mg (s)   Ti (s) + 2 MgCl2 (s)           (7.31)+3 –2              0            +3 –2             0Cr2O3 (s) + 2 Al (s)   Al2O3 (s) + 2Cr(s)             (7.32)In each case, the reducing metal is a better reducing agent than the one that is \nbeing reduced which evidently shows more \ncapability to lose electrons as compared to \nthe one that is reduced.(b) Non-metal displacement: The non-metal displacement redox reactions include \nhydrogen displacement and a rarely occurring \nreaction involving oxygen displacement.Unit 7.indd   24210/10/2022   10:37:04 AM243All alkali metals and some alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr, and Ba) which are very good reductants, will displace hydrogen from cold \nwater.   0          +1 –2               +1 –2 +1          02Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g)(7.33)  0         +1 –2             +2 –2 +1            0Ca(s)  +  2H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2 (aq) + H2(g) (7.34)Less active metals such as magnesium and iron react with steam to produce dihydrogen gas: 0         +1 –2             +2 –2 +1  0 Mg(s)  +  2H2O(l)    Mg(OH)2(s) + H2(g)             (7.35)  0         +1 –2            +3 –2            02Fe(s) + 3H2O(l)     Fe2O3(s) + 3H2(g)   (7.36)Many metals, including those which do not react with cold water, are capable of displacing hydrogen from acids. Dihydrogen from acids \nmay even be produced by such metals which \ndo not react with steam. Cadmium and tin are \nthe examples of such metals. A few examples \nfor the displacement of hydrogen from acids \nare:  0         +1 –1  +2 –1           0Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq)  →  ZnCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)           (7.37) 0           +1 –1          +2 –1             0Mg (s) + 2HCl (aq)  →  MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)           (7.38) 0     +1 –1       +2 –1           0Fe(s) + 2HCl(aq)  →  FeCl2(aq) + H2(g)            (7.39)Reactions (7.37 to 7.39) are used to prepare dihydrogen gas in the laboratory. Here, the reactivity of metals is reflected in \nthe rate of hydrogen gas evolution, which is \nthe slowest for the least active metal Fe, and \nthe fastest for the most reactive metal, Mg. \nVery less active metals, which may occur in \nthe native state such as silver (Ag), and gold \n(Au) do not react even with hydrochloric acid.In section (7.2.1) we have already discussed that the metals – zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and \nsilver (Ag) through tendency to lose electrons \nshow their reducing activity in the order Zn\u003e Cu\u003eAg. Like metals, activity series also exists for the halogens. The power of these elements \nas oxidising agents decreases as we move \ndown from fluorine to iodine in group 17 of the \nperiodic table. This implies that fluorine is so \nreactive that it can replace chloride, bromide \nand iodide ions in solution. In fact, fluorine is \nso reactive that it attacks water and displaces \nthe oxygen of water :  +1 –2           0        +1 –1        02H2O (l) + 2F2 (g)  → 4HF(aq)  + O2(g)     (7.40)It is for this reason that the displacement reactions of chlorine, bromine and iodine \nusing fluorine are not generally carried out in \naqueous solution. On the other hand, chlorine \ncan displace bromide and iodide ions in an \naqueous solution as shown below:  0     +1 –1          +1 –1           0Cl2 (g) + 2KBr (aq)  → 2 KCl (aq) + Br2 (l)            (7.41) 0     +1–1         +1 –1            0Cl2 (g) + 2KI (aq)  →  2 KCl (aq)  +  I2 (s)      (7.42)As Br2 and I2 are coloured and dissolve in CCl4, can easily be identified from the colour of the \nsolution. The above reactions can be written \nin ionic form as:   0       –1         –1           0Cl2 (g) + 2Br– (aq) → 2Cl– (aq) + Br2 (l)  (7.41a) 0            –1                      –1            0Cl2 (g) + 2I– (aq)  →  2Cl– (aq) + I2 (s)    (7.42b)Reactions (7.41) and (7.42) form the basis of identifying Br– and I– in the laboratory through the test popularly known as ‘Layer Test’. It may not be out of place to mention \nhere that bromine likewise can displace iodide \nion in solution: 0      –1                –1            0Br2 (l)  + 2I – (aq) → 2Br– (aq) + I2 (s)       (7.43)The halogen displacement reactions have a direct industrial application. The recovery of halogens from their halides requires an oxidation process, which is represented by: 2X–  →   X2   +  2e–         (7.44)here X denotes a halogen element. Whereas chemical means are available to oxidise Cl–, Br– and I–, as fluorine is the strongest oxidising Unit 7.indd   24310/10/2022   10:37:04 AM244agent; there is no way to convert F– ions to F2 by chemical means. The only way to achieve F2 from F– is to oxidise electrolytically, the details of which you will study at a later stage. 4. Disproportionation reactions  \nDisproportionation reactions are a special type of redox reactions. In a disproportionation \nreaction an element in one oxidation state \nis simultaneously oxidised and reduced.  One of the reacting substances in a \ndisproportionation reaction always contains \nan element that can exist in at least three \noxidation states. The element in the form \nof reacting substance is in the intermediate \noxidation state; and both higher and lower \noxidation states of that element are formed in \nthe reaction. The decomposition of hydrogen \nperoxide is a familiar example of the reaction, \nwhere oxygen experiences disproportionation.+1 –1                 +1  –2        02H2O2 (aq)  →  2H2O(l) +  O2(g)       (7.45)Here the oxygen of peroxide, which is present in –1 state, is converted to zero oxidation state \nin O2 and decreases to –2 oxidation state in H2O. Phosphorous, sulphur and chlorine undergo disproportionation in the alkaline \nmedium as shown below : 0                                          –3                 +1P4(s) + 3OH–(aq)+ 3H2O(l) → PH3(g) + 3H2PO2–   (aq)   (7.46)0                     –2                +2 S8(s) + 12 OH– (aq) →  4S2– (aq) + 2S2O32–(aq)  + 6H2O(l)   (7.47)0               +1               –1Cl2 (g) + 2 OH– (aq)  →     ClO– (aq) + Cl– (aq) + H2O (l)   (7.48)The reaction (7.48) describes the formation of household bleaching agents. \nThe hypochlorite ion (ClO–) formed in the reaction oxidises the colour-bearing stains \nof the substances to colourless compounds. It is of interest to mention here that whereas bromine and iodine follow the same trend \nas exhibited by chlorine in reaction (7.48),  fluorine shows deviation from this behaviour \nwhen it reacts with alkali. The reaction that \ntakes place in the case of fluorine is as follows: 2 F2(g) + 2OH–(aq) → 2 F–(aq) + OF2(g) + H2O(l)  (7.49)(It is to be noted with care that fluorine in reaction (7.49) will undoubtedly attack water to produce some oxygen also). This departure \nshown by fluorine is not surprising for us as \nwe know the limitation of fluorine that, being \nthe most electronegative element, it cannot \nexhibit any positive oxidation state. This \nmeans that among halogens, fluorine does not \nshow a disproportionation tendency. Problem 7.5 Which of the following species, do not show disproportionation reaction and \nwhy ? ClO–, ClO2–, ClO3– and ClO4 –Also write reaction for each of the species that disproportionates. Solution \nAmong the oxoanions of chlorine listed above, ClO4– does not disproportionate because in this oxoanion chlorine is \npresent in its highest oxidation state that \nis, +7. The disproportionation reactions \nfor the other three oxoanions of chlorine \nare as follows:  +1     –1        +53ClO– → 2Cl– + ClO–3   +3    +5            –16 ClO2–    4ClO3–  +  2Cl–  +5  –1           +74ClO–3 → Cl–  +   3 ClO4–Problem 7.6      \nSuggest a scheme of classification of the following redox reactions(a) N2 (g) + O2 (g)  → 2 NO (g)(b) 2Pb(NO3)2(s)  → 2PbO(s) + 4 NO2 (g) +      O2 (g)(c) NaH(s) + H2O(l) → NaOH(aq) + H2 (g)(d) 2NO2(g) + 2OH–(aq) →  NO2–(aq) +                                           NO3– (aq)+H2O(l)Unit 7.indd   24411/10/2022   15:18:43245SolutionIn reaction (a), the compound nitric oxide is formed by the combination of \nthe elemental substances, nitrogen and \noxygen; therefore, this is an example \nof combination redox reactions. The \nreaction (b) involves the breaking down \nof lead nitrate into three components; \ntherefore, this is categorised under decomposition redox reaction. In The Paradox of Fractional Oxidation NumberSometimes, we come across with certain compounds in which the oxidation number of a particular \nelement in the compound is in fraction. Examples are:C3O2 [where oxidation number of carbon  is (4/3)], Br3O8 [where oxidation number of bromine is (16/3)] and Na2S4O6 (where oxidation number of sulphur is 2.5).We know that the idea of fractional oxidation number is unconvincing to us, because electrons are never shared/transferred in fraction. Actually this fractional oxidation state is the average oxidation state of the element under examination and the structural parameters reveal that the \nelement for whom fractional oxidation state is realised is present in different oxidation states. \nStructure of the species C3O2, Br3O8 and S4O62– reveal  the following bonding situations:                                             +2    0    +2O = C = C*= C = OStructure of C3O2 (carbon suboxide)    Structure of Br3O8  (tribromooctaoxide)   Structure of S4O62– (tetrathionate ion) The element marked with asterisk in each species is exhibiting the different oxidation state (oxidation number) from rest of the atoms  of the same element in each of the species. \nThis reveals that in C3O2, two carbon atoms are present in +2 oxidation state each, whereas the third one is present in zero oxidation state and the average is 4/3. However, the realistic \npicture is +2 for two terminal carbons and zero for the middle carbon. Likewise in Br3O8, each of the two terminal bromine atoms are present in +6 oxidation state and the middle bromine \nis present in +4 oxidation state. Once again the average, that is different from reality, is  16/3. In the same fashion, in the species S4O62–, each of the two extreme sulphurs exhibits oxidation state of +5 and the two middle sulphurs as zero. The average of four  oxidation numbers of sulphurs \nof the S4O62– is 2.5, whereas the reality being + 5,0,0 and +5 oxidation number respectively for each sulphur.We may thus, in general, conclude that the idea of fractional oxidation state should be taken with care and the reality is revealed by the structures only. Further, whenever we come across \nwith fractional oxidation state of any particular element in any species, we must understand that \nthis is the average oxidation number only. In reality (revealed by structures only), the element in \nthat particular species is present in more than one whole number oxidation states. Fe3O4, Mn3O4, Pb3O4 are some of the other examples of the compounds, which are mixed oxides, where we come across with fractional oxidation states of the metal atom. However, the oxidation states may be in \nfraction as in O2+ and O2– where it is +½ and –½ respectively.reaction (c), hydrogen of water has been displaced by hydride ion into dihydrogen \ngas. Therefore, this may be called as \ndisplacement redox reaction. The reaction \n(d) involves disproportionation of NO2  (+4 state)  into NO2– (+3 state) and NO3– (+5 state). Therefore reaction (d) is an \nexample of disproportionation redox \nreaction.Unit 7.indd   24510/10/2022   10:37:04 AM246Problem 7.8Write the net ionic equation for the reaction of potassium dichromate(VI), \nK2Cr2O7 with sodium sulphite, Na2SO3, in an acid solution to give chromium(III) \nion and the sulphate  ion. Problem 7.7Why do the following reactions proceed differently ?Pb3O4 + 8HCl → 3PbCl2 + Cl2 + 4H2O   andPb3O4 + 4HNO3 → 2Pb(NO3)2 + PbO2 +                                   2H2OSolution\nPb3O4  is actually a stoichiometric mixture of 2 mol of PbO and 1 mol of PbO2. In PbO2, lead is present in +4 oxidation state, whereas the stable \noxidation state of lead in PbO is +2. PbO2 thus can act as an oxidant (oxidising \nagent) and, therefore, can oxidise Cl– ion of HCl into chlorine. We may also keep in \nmind that PbO is a basic oxide. Therefore, \nthe reactionPb3O4 + 8HCl → 3PbCl2 + Cl2 + 4H2O  can be splitted into two reactions namely:\n2PbO + 4HCl → 2PbCl2 + 2H2O     (acid-base reaction)+4              –1              +2          0PbO2 + 4HCl →  PbCl2 + Cl2 +2H2O    (redox reaction)Since HNO3 itself is an oxidising agent therefore, it is unlikely that the reaction may occur between PbO2 and HNO3. However, the acid-base reaction occurs \nbetween PbO and HNO3 as:2PbO + 4HNO3 → 2Pb(NO3)2 + 2H2OIt is the passive nature of PbO2 against HNO3 that makes the reaction different from the one that follows with HCl.(a) Oxidation Number Method: In writing equations for oxidation-reduction reactions, just as for other reactions, the compositions and \nformulas must be known for the substances \nthat react and for the products that are \nformed. The oxidation number method is now \nbest illustrated in the following steps:Step 1: Write the correct formula for each reactant and product.Step 2: Identify atoms which undergo change in oxidation number in the reaction \nby assigning the oxidation number to all \nelements in the reaction.Step 3: Calculate the increase or decrease in the oxidation number per atom and for \nthe entire molecule/ion in which it occurs. If \nthese are not equal then multiply by suitable \nnumber so that these become equal. (If you \nrealise that two substances are reduced and \nnothing is oxidised or vice-versa, something \nis wrong. Either the formulas of reactants or \nproducts are wrong or the oxidation numbers \nhave not been assigned properly).Step 4: Ascertain the involvement of ions if the reaction is taking place in water, add H+ or OH– ions to the expression on the appropriate side so that the total ionic charges of reactants \nand products are equal. If the reaction is \ncarried out in acidic solution, use H+ ions in the equation; if in basic solution, use OH– ions. Step 5 :  Make the numbers of hydrogen atoms in the expression on the two sides \nequal by adding water (H2O) molecules to the reactants or products. Now, also check the \nnumber of oxygen atoms. If there are the same \nnumber of oxygen atoms in the reactants and \nproducts, the equation then represents the \nbalanced redox reaction. Let us now explain the steps involved in the method with the help of a few problems given below: 7.3.2 Balancing of Redox ReactionsTwo methods are used to balance chemical equations for redox processes. One of these \nmethods is based on the change in the oxidation number of reducing agent and the \noxidising agent and the other method is based \non splitting the redox reaction into two half \nreactions — one involving oxidation and the \nother involving reduction. Both these methods \nare in use and the choice of their use rests \nwith the individual using them.Unit 7.indd   24610/10/2022   10:37:04 AM247Solution Step 1: The skeletal ionic equation is: \nCr2O72–(aq) + SO32–(aq) → Cr3+(aq)  + SO42–(aq)Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers for Cr and S+6  –2            +4 –2             +3          +6 –2Cr2O72–(aq) + SO32–(aq) → Cr(aq)+SO42–(aq)This indicates that the dichromate ion is \nthe oxidant and the sulphite ion is the \nreductant.Step 3: Calculate the increase and decrease of oxidation number, and make \nthem equal: from step-2 we can notice \nthat there is change in oxidation state \nof chromium and sulphur. Oxidation \nstate of chromium changes form +6 to \n+3. There is decrease of +3 in oxidation \nstate of chromium on right hand side of \nthe equation. Oxidation state of sulphur \nchanges from +4 to +6. There is an increase \nof +2 in the oxidation state of sulphur on \nright hand side. To make the increase and \ndecrease of oxidation state equal, place \nnumeral 2 before cromium ion on right \nhand side and numeral 3 before sulphate \nion on right hand side and balance the \nchromium and sulphur atoms on both the \nsides of  the equation. Thus we get+6 –2                +4 –2               +3        Cr2O72–(aq) + 3SO32– (aq)  → 2Cr3+ (aq) +         +6 –23SO42– (aq)Step 4: As the reaction occurs in the \nacidic medium, and further the ionic \ncharges are not equal on both the sides, \nadd 8H+ on the left to make ionic charges equal Cr2O72–(aq) + 3SO32–(aq)+ 8H+→ 2Cr3+(aq)   + 3SO42– (aq)Step 5: Finally, count the hydrogen atoms, and add appropriate number of \nwater molecules (i.e., 4H2O) on the right to achieve balanced redox change. Cr2O72– (aq) + 3SO32– (aq)+ 8H+ (aq) →  2Cr3+ (aq) + 3SO42– (aq) +4H2O (l)Problem 7.9  Permanganate ion reacts with bromide ion in basic medium to give manganese \ndioxide and bromate ion. Write the balanced ionic equation for the reaction. Solution Step 1: The skeletal ionic equation is : \nMnO4–(aq) + Br–(aq) → MnO2(s) + BrO3– (aq)Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers for Mn and Br+7            –1     +4            +5MnO4–(aq) + Br–(aq) →MnO2 (s) + BrO3– (aq)this indicates that permanganate ion \nis the oxidant and bromide ion is the \nreductant. Step 3: Calculate the increase and decrease of oxidation number, and make the increase equal to the decrease.   +7             –1       +4            +5  2MnO4–(aq)+Br –(aq) → 2MnO2(s)+BrO3–(aq)Step 4: As the reaction occurs in the basic medium, and the ionic charges are \nnot equal on both sides, add 2 OH– ions on the right to make ionic charges equal. 2MnO4– (aq) + Br– (aq) → 2MnO2(s) +  BrO3–(aq) + 2OH–(aq)Step 5: Finally, count the hydrogen atoms and add appropriate number of water \nmolecules (i.e. one H2O molecule) on the left side to achieve balanced redox change. 2MnO4–(aq) + Br–(aq) + H2O(l) → 2MnO2(s)             + BrO3– (aq) + 2OH–(aq)(b) Half Reaction Method: In this method, the two half equations are balanced separately and then added together to give balanced \nequation. Suppose we are to balance the equation showing the oxidation of Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions by dichromate ions (Cr2O7)2– in acidic medium, wherein, Cr2O72– ions are reduced to Cr3+ ions. The following steps are involved in this task. Step 1: Produce unbalanced equation for the reaction in ionic form : Fe2+(aq) + Cr2O72– (aq) →  Fe3+ (aq) + Cr3+(aq)   (7.50)Unit 7.indd   24710/10/2022   10:37:05 AM248Step 2: Separate the equation into half-reactions:    +2          +3  Oxidation half : Fe2+ (aq) →  Fe3+(aq)      (7.51)   +6 –2      +3Reduction half : Cr2O72–(aq) →  Cr3+(aq)   (7.52)Step 3: Balance the atoms other than O and H in each half reaction individually. Here the oxidation half reaction is already balanced with respect to Fe atoms. For the reduction \nhalf reaction, we multiply the Cr3+ by 2 to balance Cr atoms.Cr2O7 2–(aq)  →  2 Cr3+(aq) (7.53)Step 4: For reactions occurring in acidic medium, add H2O to balance O atoms and H+ to balance H atoms. Thus, we get :Cr2O7 2– (aq) + 14H+ (aq) → 2 Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O (l) (7.54)Step 5: Add electrons to one side of the half reaction to balance the charges. If need be, make the number of electrons equal in the two half reactions by multiplying one or both half reactions by appropriate number. The oxidation half reaction is thus rewritten to balance the charge: Fe2+ (aq)  →  Fe3+ (aq)  + e– (7.55)Now in the reduction half reaction there are net twelve positive charges on the left hand side and only six positive charges on the right hand side. Therefore, we add six electrons on \nthe left side. Cr2O7 2– (aq) + 14H+ (aq) + 6e– → 2Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O (l) (7.56)To equalise the number of electrons in both the half reactions, we multiply the oxidation half reaction by 6 and write as : 6Fe2+ (aq) → 6Fe3+(aq)  + 6e–        (7.57)Step 6: We add the two half reactions to achieve the overall reaction and cancel the electrons on each side. This gives the net ionic equation as : 6Fe2+(aq) + Cr2O72–(aq) + 14H+(aq) → 6 Fe3+(aq) + 2Cr 3+(aq) + 7H2O(l)  (7.58)Step 7: Verify that the equation contains the same type and number of atoms and the same \ncharges on both sides of the equation. This \nlast check reveals that the equation is fully \nbalanced with respect to number of atoms and the charges. For the reaction in a basic medium, first balance the atoms as is done in acidic medium. Then for each H+ ion, add an equal number of OH– ions to both sides of the equation. Where H+ and OH– appear on the same side of the equation, combine these to give H2O. Problem 7.10Permanganate(VII) ion, MnO4– in basic solution oxidises iodide ion, I– to produce molecular iodine (I2) and manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2). Write a balanced ionic equation to represent this redox reaction. \nSolution\nStep 1: First we write the skeletal ionic equation, which is \nMnO4– (aq) + I– (aq) → MnO2(s) + I2(s)Step 2: The two half-reactions are:            –1                 0Oxidation half :  I–(aq)   →   I2 (s)         +7           +4Reduction half:  MnO4–(aq) →  MnO2(s)Step 3: To balance the I atoms in the oxidation half reaction, we  rewrite it as:   2I– (aq) → I2 (s)Step 4: To balance the O atoms in the \nreduction half reaction, we add two water \nmolecules on the right: MnO4– (aq) → MnO2 (s) + 2 H2O (l)To balance the H atoms, we add four H+ ions on the left: \nMnO4 – (aq) + 4 H+ (aq) → MnO2(s) + 2H2O (l)As the reaction takes place in a basic solution, therefore, for four H+ ions, we add four OH– ions to both sides of the equation: MnO4– (aq) + 4H+ (aq) + 4OH–(aq)  →  MnO2 (s) + 2 H2O(l)  + 4OH– (aq)Replacing the H+ and OH– ions with water, Unit 7.indd   24810/10/2022   10:37:05 AM249the resultant equation is: MnO4– (aq) + 2H2O (l) → MnO2 (s) + 4 OH– (aq)Step 5 : In this step we balance the charges of the two half-reactions in the manner depicted as:  2I– (aq) → I2 (s) + 2e–MnO4–(aq) + 2H2O(l) + 3e– → MnO2(s)  + 4OH–(aq)Now to equalise the number of electrons, \nwe multiply the oxidation half-reaction by \n3 and the reduction half-reaction by 2. 6I–(aq) → 3I2 (s) + 6e–2 MnO4– (aq) + 4H2O (l) +6e– → 2MnO2(s)   + 8OH– (aq)Step 6: Add two half-reactions to obtain the net reactions after cancelling \nelectrons on both sides. 6I–(aq) + 2MnO4–(aq) + 4H2O(l) → 3I2(s) +  2MnO2(s) +8 OH–(aq)Step 7: A final verification shows that the equation is balanced in respect of \nthe number of atoms and charges on \nboth sides. 7.3.3 Redox Reactions as the Basis  for \nTitrations In acid-base systems we come across with a titration method for finding out the strength \nof one solution against the other using a pH sensitive indicator. Similarly, in redox \nsystems, the titration method can be adopted \nto determine the strength of a reductant/\noxidant using a redox sensitive indicator. \nThe usage of indicators in redox titration is \nillustrated below:(i) In one situation, the reagent itself is intensely coloured, e.g., permanganate ion, MnO4–. Here MnO4– acts as the self indicator. The visible end point in this case \nis achieved after the last of the reductant \n(Fe2+ or C2O42–) is oxidised and the first lasting tinge of pink colour appears at \nMnO4– concentration as low as 10–6 mol dm–3  (10–6 mol L–1). This ensures a minimal ‘overshoot’ in colour beyond the equivalence \npoint, the point where the reductant and \nthe oxidant are equal in terms of their \nmole stoichiometry.(ii) If there is no dramatic auto-colour change (as with MnO4– titration), there are indicators which are oxidised immediately after the last bit of the reactant is consumed, \nproducing a dramatic colour change. The \nbest example is afforded by Cr2O72–, which is not a self-indicator, but oxidises the \nindicator substance diphenylamine just \nafter the equivalence point to produce an \nintense blue colour, thus signalling the \nend point. (iii) There is yet another method which is \ninteresting and quite common. Its use is \nrestricted to those reagents which are able to oxidise I– ions, say, for example, Cu(II): 2Cu2+(aq) + 4I–(aq) → Cu2I2(s) + I2(aq)  (7.59)This method relies on the facts that iodine itself gives an intense blue colour with \nstarch and has a very specific reaction with \nthiosulphate ions (S2O32–), which too is a redox reaction: I2(aq) + 2 S2O32–(aq)→2I–(aq) + S4O62–(aq) (7.60)I2, though insoluble in water, remains in solution containing KI as KI3.On addition of starch after the liberation of iodine from the reaction of Cu2+ ions on iodide ions, an intense blue colour appears. This colour disappears as soon as the iodine \nis consumed by the thiosulphate ions. Thus, \nthe end-point can easily be tracked and the \nrest is the stoichiometric calculation only. 7.3.4 Limitations of Concept of Oxidation Number As you have observed in the above discussion, the concept of redox processes has been evolving with time. This process of evolution \nis continuing. In fact, in recent past the \noxidation process is visualised as a decrease \nin electron density and reduction process as \nan increase in electron density around the \natom(s) involved in the reaction.7.4 REDOX REACTIONS AND ELECTRODE PROCESSESThe experiment corresponding to reaction (7.15), can also be observed if zinc rod is dipped in copper sulphate solution. The \nredox reaction takes place and during the Unit 7.indd   24910/10/2022   10:37:05 AM250reaction, zinc is oxidised to zinc ions and copper ions are reduced to metallic copper \ndue to direct transfer of electrons from zinc \nto copper ion. During this reaction heat is \nalso evolved.  Now we modify the experiment \nin such a manner that for the same redox \nreaction transfer of electrons takes place \nindirectly. This necessitates the separation \nof zinc metal from copper sulphate solution.  \nWe take copper sulphate solution in a beaker \nand put a copper strip or rod in it. We also \ntake zinc sulphate solution in another beaker \nand put a zinc rod or strip in it.  Now reaction \ntakes place in either of the beakers and at the \ninterface of the metal and its salt solution in \neach beaker both the reduced and oxidized \nforms of the same species are present.  These \nrepresent the species in the reduction and \noxidation half reactions. A redox couple is \ndefined as having together the oxidised and \nreduced forms of a substance taking part in \nan oxidation or reduction half reaction.This is represented by separating the oxidised form from the reduced form by \na vertical line or a slash representing an \ninterface (e.g. solid/solution).  For example \nin this experiment the two redox couples are represented as Zn2+/Zn and Cu2+/Cu.  In both cases, oxidised form is put before \nthe reduced form. Now we put the beaker \ncontaining copper sulphate solution and  the \nbeaker containing zinc sulphate solution \nside by side (Fig. 7.3). We connect solutions \nin two beakers by a salt bridge (a U-tube \ncontaining a solution of potassium chloride \nor ammonium nitrate usually solidified by \nboiling with agar agar and later cooling to a \njelly like substance). This provides an electric \ncontact between the two solutions without \nallowing them to mix with each other.  The \nzinc and copper rods are connected by a \nmetallic wire with a provision for an ammeter \nand a switch. The set-up as shown in Fig.7.3 \nis known as Daniell cell. When the switch is \nin the off position, no reaction takes place in \neither of the beakers and no current flows \nthrough the metallic wire.  As soon as the \nswitch is in the on position, we make the \nfollowing observations:1. The transfer of electrons now does not take place directly from Zn to Cu2+ but through the metallic wire connecting the \ntwo rods as is apparent from the arrow \nwhich indicates the flow of current.  2. The electricity from solution in one beaker to solution in the other beaker flows by \nthe migration of ions through the salt \nbridge.  We know that the flow of current \nis possible only if there is a potential \ndifference between the copper and zinc \nrods known as electrodes here.The potential  associated with each electrode is known as electrode potential. If the concentration of each species taking part in the electrode reaction is unity (if any \ngas appears in the electrode reaction, it is \nconfined to 1 atmospheric pressure) and \nfurther the reaction is carried out at 298K, \nthen the potential of each electrode is said \nto be the Standard Electrode Potential. By \nconvention, the standard electrode potential \n(E) of hydrogen electrode is 0.00 volts. The electrode potential value for each electrode \nprocess is a measure of the relative tendency \nof the active species in the process to remain \nin the oxidised/reduced form. A negative E means that the redox couple is a stronger Fig.7.3 The set-up for Daniell cell. Electrons produced at the anode due to oxidation of Zn travel through the external circuit \nto the cathode where these reduce the \ncopper ions. The circuit is completed \ninside the cell by the migration of ions \nthrough the salt bridge.  It may be noted \nthat the direction of current is opposite to \nthe direction of electron flow.Unit 7.indd   25010/10/2022   10:37:05 AM251 Reaction (Oxidised form + ne–        → Reduced form) E / VF2(g) + 2e–   → 2F–  2.87Co3+ + e–  → Co2+  1.81H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e–  → 2H2O     1.78MnO4– + 8H+ + 5e–  → Mn2+ + 4H2O  1.51Au3+ + 3e–  → Au(s)  1.40Cl2(g) + 2e–  → 2Cl–  1.36Cr2O72– + 14H+ + 6e–  → 2Cr3+ + 7H2O  1.33O2(g) + 4H+ + 4e–  → 2H2O  1.23MnO2(s) + 4H+ + 2e–  → Mn2+ + 2H2O  1.23Br2 + 2e–  → 2Br–  1.09NO3– + 4H+ + 3e–  → NO(g) + 2H2O  0.972Hg2+ + 2e–  → Hg22+  0.92Ag+ + e–  → Ag(s)  0.80Fe3+ + e–  → Fe2+  0.77O2(g) + 2H+ + 2e–  → H2O2  0.68I2(s) + 2e–  → 2I–  0.54Cu+ + e–  → Cu(s)  0.52Cu2+ + 2e–  → Cu(s)  0.34AgCl(s) + e–  → Ag(s) + Cl–  0.22AgBr(s) + e–  → Ag(s) + Br–  0.102H+ + 2e–  → H2(g)  0.00Pb2+ + 2e–  → Pb(s)  –0.13Sn2+ + 2e–  → Sn(s)  –0.14Ni2+ + 2e–  → Ni(s)  –0.25Fe2+ + 2e–  → Fe(s)  –0.44Cr3+ + 3e–  → Cr(s)  –0.74Zn2+ + 2e–  → Zn(s)  –0.762H2O + 2e– → H2(g) + 2OH–  –0.83Al3+ + 3e–  → Al(s)  –1.66Mg2+ + 2e–  → Mg(s)  –2.36Na+ + e–  → Na(s)  –2.71Ca2+ + 2e–  → Ca(s)  –2.87K+ + e–  → K(s)  –2.93Li+ + e–  → Li(s)  –3.05 Increasing strength of oxidising agent Increasing strength of reducing agent1.

Unit 7.indd   25110/10/2022   10:37:05 AM252SUMMARY Redox reactions form an important class of reactions in which oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously. Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation \nnumber, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail. Oxidation, \nreduction, oxidising agent (oxidant) and reducing agent (reductant) have been viewed \naccording to each conceptualisation. Oxidation numbers are assigned in accordance with a \nconsistent set of rules. Oxidation number and ion-electron method both are useful means in \nwriting equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories: \ncombination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions. The concept of \nredox couple and electrode processes is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide \napplications in the study of electrode processes and cells.EXERCISES7.1 Assign oxidation number to the underlined elements in each of the following species:  (a) NaH2PO4 (b) NaHSO4 (c)  H4P2O7 (d)  K2MnO4 (e) CaO2 (f)  NaBH4   (g)  H2S2O7 (h)  KAl(SO4)2.12 H2O7.2 What are the oxidation number of the underlined elements in each of the following and how do you rationalise your results ?

The resulting compounds are studied \nunder a separate branch of chemistry called organic \nchemistry. This unit incorporates some basic principles \nand techniques of analysis required for understanding the \nformation and properties of organic compounds.8.1 GENERAL INTRODUCTIONOrganic compounds are vital for sustaining life on earth and include complex molecules like genetic information bearing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and proteins that \nconstitute essential compounds of our blood, muscles and skin. Organic compounds appear in materials like clothing, fuels, polymers, dyes and medicines. These are some of \nthe important areas of application of these compounds.Science of organic chemistry is about two hundred years old. Around the year 1780, chemists began to \ndistinguish between organic compounds obtained from \nplants and animals and inorganic compounds prepared \nfrom mineral sources. Berzilius, a Swedish chemist \nproposed that a ‘vital force’ was responsible for the \nformation of organic compounds. However, this notion \nwas rejected in 1828 when F. Wohler synthesised an \norganic compound, urea from an inorganic compound, \nammonium cyanate.NH4CNO     NH2CONH2Ammonium cyanate          UreaThe pioneering synthesis of acetic acid by Kolbe (1845) and that of methane by Berthelot (1856) showed conclusively that organic compounds could be synthesised \nfrom inorganic sources in a laboratory.UNIT 8Unit 8.indd   2562/24/2023   16:52:17257The development of electronic theory of covalent bonding ushered organic chemistry into its modern shape.8.2 tetraValence OF carBOn:  shaPes OF Organic cOmPOunds8.2.1 The Shapes of Carbon Compounds  The knowledge of fundamental concepts of molecular structure helps in understanding and predicting the properties of organic \ncompounds. You have already learnt theories \nof valency and molecular structure in Unit 4. \nAlso, you already know that tetravalence of \ncarbon and the formation of covalent bonds \nby it are explained in terms of its electronic \nconfiguration and the hybridisation of s and p orbitals. It may be recalled that formation and \nthe shapes of molecules like methane (CH4), ethene (C2H4), ethyne (C2H2) are explained in terms of the use of sp3, sp2 and sp hybrid orbitals by carbon atoms in the respective \nmolecules. Hybridisation influences the bond length and bond enthalpy (strength) in compounds. \nThe sp hybrid orbital contains more s character and hence it is closer to its nucleus \nand forms shorter and stronger bonds than \nthe sp3 hybrid orbital. The sp2 hybrid orbital is intermediate in s character between sp and sp3 and, hence, the length and enthalpy of the bonds it forms, are also intermediate \nbetween them. The change in hybridisation \naffects the electronegativity of carbon. The \ngreater the s character of the hybrid orbitals, \nthe greater is the electronegativity. Thus, a \ncarbon atom having an sp hybrid orbital with 50% s character is more electronegative than that possessing  sp2 or sp3 hybridised orbitals. This relative electronegativity is reflected in \nseveral physical and chemical properties of \nthe molecules concerned, about which you \nwill learn in later units. 8.2.2  some characteristic Features of π BondsIn a π (pi) bond formation, parallel orientation of the two p orbitals on adjacent atoms is necessary for a proper sideways overlap. Thus, in H2C=CH2 molecule all the atoms must be in the same plane. The p orbitals are mutually parallel and both the p orbitals are perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. \nRotation of one CH2 fragment with respect to other interferes with maximum overlap \nof p orbitals and, therefore, such rotation about carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is \nrestricted. The electron charge cloud of the π \nbond is located above and below the plane of \nbonding atoms. This results in the electrons \nbeing easily available to the attacking  reagents. In general, π bonds provide the most reactive centres in the molecules containing multiple bonds.Problem 8.1How many σ and π bonds are present in each of the following molecules?(a) HC≡CCH=CHCH3 (b) CH2=C=CHCH3 solution(a) σC – C: 4; σC–H : 6; πC=C :1; π C≡C:2(b) σC – C: 3; σC–H: 6; πC=C: 2.Problem 8.2What is the type of hybridisation of each carbon in the following compounds?

The Lewis structure or dot structure, dash structure, condensed structure and bond line structural \nformulas are some of the specific types. The \nLewis structures, however, can be simplified \nby representing the two-electron covalent �bond by a dash (–). Such a structural formula \nfocuses on the electrons involved in bond \nformation.  A single dash represents a single \nbond, double dash  is used for double bond \nand a triple dash represents triple bond. Lone-\npairs of electrons on heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, \nnitrogen, sulphur, halogens etc.) may or may \nnot be shown. Thus, ethane (C2H6), ethene (C2H4), ethyne (C2H2) and methanol (CH3OH) can be represented by the following structural \nformulas. Such structural representations are \ncalled complete structural formulas.Similarly, CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 can be further condensed to CH3(CH2)6CH3. For further simplification, organic chemists \nuse another way of representing the \nstructures, in which only lines are used. \nIn this bond-line structural representation \nof organic compounds, carbon and \nhydrogen atoms are not shown and the \nlines representing carbon-carbon bonds are  \ndrawn in a zig-zag fashion. The only atoms \nspecifically written are oxygen, chlorine, \nnitrogen etc. The terminals denote methyl  (–CH3) groups (unless indicated otherwise by a functional group), while the line junctions \ndenote carbon atoms bonded to appropriate \nnumber of hydrogens required to satisfy the \nvalency of the carbon atoms. Some of the \nexamples are represented as follows:(i) 3-Methyloctane can be represented in various forms as:(a)   CH3CH2CHCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3                     |                   CH3 These structural formulas can be further abbreviated by omitting some or all of the dashes representing covalent bonds and by \nindicating the number of identical groups \nattached to an atom by a subscript. The \nresulting expression of the compound is \ncalled a condensed structural formula. Thus, \nethane, ethene, ethyne and methanol can be \nwritten as:CH3CH3        H2C=CH2       HC≡CH            CH3OH Ethane       Ethene         Ethyne      Methanol        Ethane                  Ethene                  Ethyne              Methanol(ii) Various ways of representing 2-bromo butane are:(a)  CH3CHBrCH2CH3  (b)  (c)  (b)(c)Unit 8.indd   25810/10/2022   10:37:29 AM259In cyclic compounds, the bond-line formulas may be given as follows:CyclopropaneCyclopentanechlorocyclohexaneProblem 8.4Expand each of the following condensed formulas into their complete structural \nformulas.(a) CH3CH2COCH2CH3(b) CH3CH=CH(CH2)3CH3solution(a) (b)  (b) solutionCondensed formula:(a) HO(CH2)3CH(CH3)CH(CH3)2(b) HOCH(CN)2Bond-line formula:Problem 8.5For each of the following compounds, write a  condensed formula and also their \nbond-line formula.(a) HOCH2CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH3(b)(a)Problem 8.6Expand each of the following bond-line formulas to show all the atoms including \ncarbon and hydrogen(a)(b)(c)(d)solutionUnit 8.indd   25910/10/2022   10:37:30 AM260 Framework model Ball and stick modelSpace filling modelFig. 8.28.3.2  Three-Dimensional Representation of Organic \nMoleculesThe three-dimensional (3-D) structure of organic molecules can be represented on \npaper by using certain conventions. For \nexample, by using solid () and dashed () wedge formula, the 3-D image of a molecule from a two-dimensional picture can be perceived. In these formulas the solid-wedge is used to indicate a bond \nprojecting out of the plane of paper, towards \nthe observer. The dashed-wedge is used to \ndepict the bond projecting out of the plane of \nthe paper and away from the observer. Wedges \nare shown in such a way that the broad end of \nthe wedge is towards the observer. The bonds \nlying in plane of the paper are depicted by \nusing a normal line (—). 3-D representation of \nmethane molecule on paper has been shown \nin Fig. 8.1 Fig. 8.1 Wedge-and-dash representation of CH4Molecular ModelsMolecular models are physical devices \nthat are used for a better visualisation and \nperception of three-dimensional shapes \nof organic molecules. These are made of \nwood, plastic or metal and are commercially \navailable. Commonly three types of molecular \nmodels are used: (1) Framework model, (2) \nBall-and-stick model, and (3) Space filling \nmodel. In the framework model only the bonds connecting the atoms of a molecule \nand not the atoms themselves are shown. \nThis model emphasizes the pattern of \nbonds of a molecule while ignoring the size \nof atoms. In the ball-and-stick model, both the atoms and the bonds are shown. Balls \nrepresent atoms and the stick denotes a \nbond. Compounds containing C=C (e.g., \nethene) can best be represented by using \nsprings in place of sticks. These models are \nreferred to as ball-and-spring model. The \nspace-filling model emphasises the relative \nsize of each atom based on its van der Waals \nradius. Bonds are not shown in this model. \nIt conveys the volume occupied by each atom \nin the molecule. In addition to these models, \ncomputer graphics can also be used for \nmolecular modelling. Unit 8.indd   26011/10/2022   15:19:57261                        8.4 CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDSThe existing large number of organic compounds and their ever-increasing numbers has made it necessary to classify \nthem on the basis of their structures. Organic \ncompounds are broadly classified as follows:I. Acyclic or open chain compoundsThese compounds are also called as aliphatic compounds and consist of straight or \nbranched chain compounds, for example:(homocyclic).CyclohexaneCyclohexeneCyclopropane Sometimes atoms other than carbon are \nalso present in the ring (heterocylic). \nTetrahydrofuran given below is an example \nof this type of compound:TetrahydrofuranThese exhibit some of the properties similar \nto those of aliphatic compounds.(b) Aromatic compoundsAromatic compounds are special types of compounds. You will learn about these compounds in detail in Unit 9. These include \nbenzene and other related ring compounds \n(benzenoid). Like alicyclic compounds, \naromatic comounds may also have hetero \natom in the ring. Such compounds are called \nhetrocyclic aromatic compounds. Some of \nthe examples of various types of aromatic \ncompounds are:Benzenoid aromatic compoundsBenzene          Aniline            NaphthaleneNon-benzenoid compoundTroponeIsobutaneAcetaldehydeAcetic acidCH3CH3EthaneII Cyclic or closed chain or ring compounds(a) Alicyclic compounds Alicyclic (aliphatic cyclic) compounds contain carbon atoms joined in the form of a ring  Unit 8.indd   26111/10/2022   15:20:58262Heterocyclic aromatic compounds   Furan             Thiophene            PyridineOrganic compounds can also be classified on the basis of functional groups, into families or homologous series. 8.4.1 Functional GroupThe functional group is an atom  or a group of atoms joined to the carbon chain which is \nresponsible for the characteristic chemical properties of the organic compounds. The �examples are hydroxyl group (–OH), aldehyde �group (–CHO) and carboxylic acid group (–\nCOOH) etc.8.4.2 Homologous SeriesA group or a series of organic compounds each containing a characteristic functional group forms a homologous series and the members of \nthe series are called homologues. The members of a homologous series can be represented by \ngeneral molecular formula and the successive \nmembers differ from each other in molecular �formula by a –CH2 unit. There are a number of homologous series of organic compounds. \nSome of these are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, \nhaloalkanes, alkanols, alkanals, alkanones, \nalkanoic acids, amines etc. It is also possible that a compound contains two or more identical or different functional \ngroups. This gives rise to polyfunctional compounds.8.5  NOMENCLATURE OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDSOrganic chemistry deals with millions of compounds. In order to clearly identify \nthem, a systematic method of naming has \nbeen developed and is known as the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) system of nomenclature. In this \nsystematic nomenclature, the names are correlated with the structure such that the \nreader or listener can deduce the structure \nfrom the name.  Before the IUPAC system of nomenclature, however, organic compounds were assigned names based on their origin or certain properties. For instance, citric acid is named so because it is found in citrus fruits and the \nacid found in red ant is named formic acid \nsince the Latin word for ant is formica. These \nnames are traditional and are considered \nas trivial or common names. Some common names are followed even today. For example,  \nBuckminsterfullerene is a common name \ngiven to the newly discovered C60 cluster (a form of carbon) noting its structural similarity \nto the geodesic domes popularised by the \nfamous architect R. Buckminster Fuller. \nCommon names are useful and in many \ncases indispensable, particularly when the \nalternative systematic names are lengthy and \ncomplicated. Common names of some organic \ncompounds are given in Table 8.1. Table 8.1 Common or Trivial Names of Some Organic Compounds8.5.1  The IUPAC System of NomenclatureA systematic name of an organic compound is generally derived by identifying the parent hydrocarbon and the functional group(s) \nattached to it. See the example given below. Unit 8.indd   26211/10/2022   15:20:58263By further using prefixes and suffixes, the parent name can be modified to obtain the \nactual name. Compounds containing carbon \nand hydrogen only are called hydrocarbons. \nA hydrocarbon is termed saturated if it \ncontains only carbon-carbon single bonds. \nThe IUPAC name for a homologous series of \nsuch compounds is alkane. Paraffin (Latin: \nlittle affinity) was the earlier name given to \nthese compounds. Unsaturated hydrocarbons \nare those, which contain at least one carbon-\ncarbon double or triple bond. 8.5.2 iuPac nomenclature of  alkanesStraight chain hydrocarbons: The names of such compounds are based on their chain structure, and end with suffix ‘-ane’ and carry \na prefix indicating the number of carbon \natoms present in the chain (except from CH4 to C4H10, where the prefixes are derived from trivial names). The IUPAC names of some \nstraight chain saturated hydrocarbons are \ngiven in Table 8.2. The alkanes in Table \n8.2 differ from each other by merely the \nnumber of -CH2 groups in the chain. They are homologues of alkane series.In order to name such compounds, the names of alkyl groups are prefixed to the name of \nparent alkane. An alkyl group is derived \nfrom a saturated hydrocarbon by removing \na hydrogen atom from carbon.  Thus, CH4 becomes  -CH3 and is called methyl group. An alkyl group is named by substituting ‘yl’ for \n‘ane’ in the corresponding alkane. Some alkyl groups are listed in Table 8.3.table 8.3  some alkyl groupstable 8.2 iuPac names of some unbranched Saturated HydrocarbonsBranched chain hydrocarbons: In a branched chain compound small chains of carbon atoms are attached at one or more \ncarbon atoms of the parent chain. The small \ncarbon chains (branches) are called alkyl \ngroups. For example:CH3–CH–CH2–CH3  CH3–CH–CH2–CH–CH3               CH3              CH2CH3   CH3(a) (b) Abbreviations are used for some alkyl groups. For example, methyl is abbreviated as Me, ethyl as Et, propyl as Pr and butyl as Bu. The alkyl groups can be branched also. Thus, \npropyl and butyl groups can have branched \nstructures as shown below. CH3-CH- CH3-CH2-CH-      CH3-CH-CH2-                                                                      CH3CH3CH3Isopropyl-sec-Butyl-Isobutyl-                      CH3            CH3CH3-C-           CH3-C-CH2-               CH3                     CH3tert-Butyl-            Neopentyl- Common branched groups have specific trivial names. For example, the propyl groups can either be n-propyl group or isopropyl group. The branched butyl groups are called sec-butyl, isobutyl and tert-butyl group. \nWe also encounter the structural unit,  –CH2C(CH3)3, which is called neopentyl group.Nomenclature of branched chain alkanes:  We encounter a number of branched chain \nalkanes. The rules for naming them are given below.Unit 8.indd   26310/10/2022   10:37:31 AM264separated from the groups by hyphens and there is no break between methyl  and nonane.] 4. If two or more identical substituent \ngroups are present then the numbers \nare separated by commas. The names of \nidentical substituents are not repeated, instead prefixes such as di (for 2), tri  (for 3), tetra (for 4), penta (for 5), hexa (for \n6) etc. are used. While writing the name \nof the substituents in alphabetical order, \nthese prefixes, however, are not considered. \nThus, the following compounds are  named as:  CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3      CH3-CH-CH2-CH-CH3 CH3 C CH2CH CH3 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 52,4-Dimethylpentane 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane  H3C H2C CH3        CH3CH2CHCCH2CH2CH3  1 2 3 4 5 6 7     CH3 3-Ethyl-4,4-dimethylheptane 5. If the two substituents are found in \nequivalent positions, the lower number is given to the one coming first in the �alphabetical listing. Thus, the following \ncompound is 3-ethyl-6-methyloctane and \nnot 6-ethyl-3-methyloctane. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8CH3 — CH2—CH—CH2—CH2—CH—CH2 —CH3          CH2CH3  CH3 6. The branched alkyl groups can be \nnamed by following the above mentioned \nprocedures. However, the carbon atom of the branch that attaches to the root �alkane is numbered 1 as exemplified \nbelow. 4 3 2 1 CH3–CH–CH2–CH–       CH3 CH3  1,3-Dimethylbutyl-1. First of all, the longest carbon chain in �the molecule is identified. In the example  (I) given below, the longest chain has nine \ncarbons and it is considered as the parent \nor root chain. Selection of parent chain as shown in (II) is not correct because it has \nonly eight carbons.2. The carbon atoms of the parent chain are numbered to identify the parent alkane and to locate the positions of the carbon \natoms at which branching takes place due \nto the substitution of alkyl group in place \nof hydrogen atoms. The numbering is �done in such a way that the branched �carbon atoms get the lowest possible \nnumbers. Thus, the numbering in the above example should be from left to right \n(branching at carbon atoms 2 and 6) and \nnot from right to left (giving numbers \n4 and  8 to the carbon atoms at which branches are attached).  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9C  C  C  C  C  C  C  C  C      C    CC9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1C  C  C  C  C  C  C  C  C     C   C  C 3. The names of  alkyl groups attached as a branch are then prefixed to the name of the parent alkane and position \nof the substituents is indicated by the \nappropriate numbers. If different alkyl \ngroups are present, they are listed in \nalphabetical order. Thus, name for the \ncompound shown above is: 6-ethyl-2-methylnonane. [Note: the numbers are Unit 8.indd   26410/10/2022   10:37:31 AM265The name of such branched chain alkyl group is placed in parenthesis while naming the \ncompound. While writing the trivial names \nof substituents’ in alphabetical order, the \nprefixes iso- and neo- are considered to be \nthe part of the fundamental name of alkyl \ngroup. The prefixes sec- and tert- are not  \nconsidered to be the part of the fundamental \nname. The use of iso and related common \nprefixes for naming alkyl groups is also \nallowed by the IUPAC nomenclature as long \nas these are not further substituted. In multi-\nsubstituted compounds, the following rules \nmay aso be remembered:•\tIf\tthere\thappens\tto\tbe\ttwo\tchains\tof\tequal\tsize, then that chain is to be selected which contains more number of side chains.•\tAfter\tselection\tof\tthe\tchain,\tnumbering\tis to be done from the end closer to the \nsubstituent.5-(2,2-Dimethylpropyl)nonane     Problem 8.7Structures and IUPAC names of some \nhydrocarbons are given below.

If side \nchains are present, then the rules given above \nare applied.

Compounds having the same functional \ngroup undergo similar reactions. For example, \nCH3OH, CH3CH2OH, and (CH3)2CHOH — all having -OH functional group liberate \nhydrogen on reaction with sodium metal. \nThe presence of functional groups enables \nsystematisation of organic compounds into \ndifferent classes. Examples of some functional \ngroups with their prefixes and suffixes along \nwith some examples of organic compounds \npossessing these are given in Table 8.4.First of all, the functional group present in the molecule is identified which determines \nthe choice of appropriate suffix. The longest chain of carbon atoms containing the �functional group is numbered in such a way �that the functional group is attached at the �carbon atom possessing lowest possible \nnumber in the chain. By using the suffix as given in Table 8.4, the name of the compound is arrived at. In the case of polyfunctional compounds, one of the functional groups is chosen as the principal functional group and the compound \nis then named on that basis. The remaining \nfunctional groups, which are subordinate \nfunctional groups, are named as substituents \nusing the appropriate prefixes. The choice of \nprincipal functional group is made on the basis \nof order of preference. The order of decreasing �priority for some functional groups is: -cOOh, –sO3h, -cOOr (r=alkyl group), cOcl,   -CONH2, -cn,-hc=O,  \u003ec=O, -Oh, -nh2, \u003e c=c\u003c,  -c≡C- . The –R, C6H5-, halogens (F, Cl, Br, I), –NO2, alkoxy (–OR) etc. are always prefix substituents. Thus, a compound containing \nboth an alcohol and a keto group is named \nas hydroxyalkanone since the keto group is \npreferred to the hydroxyl group. For example, HOCH2(CH2)3CH2COCH3 will be named as 7-hydroxyheptan-2-one and not \nas 2-oxoheptan -7-ol. Similarly, BrCH2CH=CH2  is named as 3-bromoprop-1-ene and not \n1-bromoprop-2-ene.  If more than one functional group of the same type are present, their number is \nindicated by adding di, tri, etc. before the class suffix. In such cases the full name of the parent alkane is written before the class suffix. For example CH2(OH)CH2(OH) is named as  ethane–1,2–diol. However, the ending – ne of \nthe parent alkane is dropped  in the case of \ncompounds having more than  one  double or \ntriple bond; for example, CH2=CH-CH=CH2 is named as buta–1,3–diene.Problem 8.8Write the IUPAC names of the compounds  i-iv from their given structures.solution • The functional group present is an \nalcohol (OH). Hence the suffix is ‘-ol’.• The longest chain containing -OH \nhas eight carbon atoms. Hence the  corresponding saturated hydrocar-bon is octane.• The -OH is on carbon atom 3.

Hence, the systematic name of this \ncompound is 6-Methyloctan-3-ol.solutionThe functional group present is ketone \n(\u003eC=O), hence suffix ‘-one’. Presence \nof two keto groups is indicated by ‘di’, hence suffix becomes ‘dione’. The two \nketo groups are at carbons 2 and 4. \nThe longest chain contains 6 carbon \natoms, hence, parent hydrocarbon is \nhexane. Thus, the systematic name is \nHexane-2,4-dione.Unit 8.indd   26610/10/2022   10:37:32 AM267table 8.4  some Functional groups and classes of Organic compoundsUnit 8.indd   26710/10/2022   10:37:32 AM268solutionHere, two functional groups namely ketone and carboxylic acid are present. The principal functional group is the \ncarboxylic acid group; hence the parent \nchain will be suffixed with ‘oic’ acid. \nNumbering of the chain starts from �carbon of – COOH functional group. \nThe keto group in the chain at carbon \n5 is indicated by ‘oxo’. The longest \nchain including the principal functional  \ngroup has 6 carbon atoms; hence the \nparent hydrocarbon is hexane. The \ncompound is, therefore, named as  5-Oxohexanoic acid.solutionThe two C=C functional groups are present at carbon atoms 1 and 3, while \nthe C≡C functional group is present at \ncarbon 5. These groups are indicated by \nsuffixes ‘diene’ and ‘yne’ respectively. The \nlongest chain containing the functional \ngroups has 6 carbon atoms; hence the \nparent hydrocarbon is hexane.

The \nfunctional group chloro is present at \ncarbon 2. Hence, the structure of the \ncompound is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH(Cl)CH3.(ii) ‘pent’ indicates that parent hydrocarbon contains 5 carbon atoms \nin the chain. ‘en’ and ‘ol’ correspond to \nthe functional groups C=C and -OH at \ncarbon atoms 4 and 2 respectively. Thus, \nthe structure is CH2=CHCH2CH (OH)CH3.(iii) Six membered ring containing a carbon-carbon double bond is implied \nby cyclohexene, which is numbered as \nshown in (I). The prefix 3-nitro means \nthat a nitro group is present on C-3. \nThus, complete structural formula of the \ncompound is (II). Double bond is suffixed \nfunctional group whereas NO2 is prefixed functional group therefore double bond �gets preference over –NO2 group:(iv) ‘1-ol’ means that a -OH group is \npresent at C-1. OH is suffixed functional \ngroup and gets preference over C=C \nbond. Thus the structure is as shown  in (II):(v) ‘heptanal’ indicates the compound to be an aldehyde containing 7 carbon \natoms in the parent chain. The  ‘6-hydroxy’ indicates that -OH group is \npresent at carbon 6. Thus, the structural \nformula of the compound is: CH3CH(OH)CH2CH2CH2CH2CHO. Carbon atom of –CHO group is included while numbering \nthe carbon chain.8.5.4 nomenclature of substituted Benzene compoundsFor IUPAC nomenclature of substituted benzene compounds, the substituent is placed as prefix to the word benzene as shown \nin the following examples. However, common \nnames (written in bracket below) of many \nsubstituted benzene compounds are also universally used. Unit 8.indd   26810/10/2022   10:37:32 AM269If benzene ring is disubstituted, the position of substituents is defined by numbering the carbon atoms of the \nring such that the substituents are \nlocated at the lowest numbers possible.\nFor example, the compound(b) is named \nas 1,3-dibromobenzene and not as 1,5-dibromobenzene. Substituent of the base compound is assigned number1 and then the direction of numbering is chosen such that the \nnext substituent gets the lowest number. \nThe substituents appear in the name in \nalphabetical order. Some examples are given \nbelow.Methylbenzene      Methoxybenzene     Aminobenzene\n    (Toluene)              (Anisole)                 (Aniline)      Nitrobenzene                  Bromobenzene1,2-Dibromo- benzene1,3-Dibromo- benzene1,4-Dibromo- benzene(a)(b)(c) In the trivial system of nomenclature the terms ortho (o), meta (m) and para (p) are used as prefixes to indicate the relative \npositions 1,2;1,3 and 1,4 respectively. Thus, \n1,3-dibromobenzene (b) is named as  m-dibromobenzene (meta is abbreviated as m-) and the other isomers of dibromobenzene 1,2-(a) and 1,4-(c), are named as ortho (or just o-) and para (or just p-)-dibromobenzene, respectively.  For tri - or higher substituted benzene derivatives, these prefixes cannot be used \nand the compounds are named by identifying substituent positions on the ring by following \nthe lowest locant rule. In some cases, common \nname of benzene derivatives is taken as  the \nbase compound.1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (not 4-chloro,1,3-dinitrobenzene)                2-Chloro-1-methyl-4-nitrobenzene (not 4-methyl-5-chloro-nitrobenzene)    2-Chloro-4-methylanisole4-Ethyl-2-methylaniline 3,4-Dimethylphenol When a benzene ring is attached to an alkane with a functional group, it is considered as substituent, instead of a parent. The name \nfor benzene as substituent is phenyl (C6H5-, also abbreviated as Ph).Unit 8.indd   26910/10/2022   10:37:33 AM270different carbon skeletons, these are referred to as chain isomers and the phenomenon is \ntermed as chain isomerism. For example, \nC5H12 represents three compounds:IsomerismStructural isomerismStereoisomerismChainisomerismPositionisomerismFunctionalgroupisomerismMetamerismGeometricalisomerismOpticalisomerism8.6 isOmerismThe phenomenon of existence of two or more \ncompounds possessing the same molecular \nformula but different properties is known as isomerism. Such compounds are called \nas isomers. The following flow chart shows \ndifferent types of isomerism. 8.6.1 structural isomerismCompounds having the same molecular formula but different structures (manners in which atoms are linked) are classified as \nstructural isomers. Some typical examples \nof different types of structural isomerism are \ngiven below: (i) Chain isomerism: When two or more compounds have similar molecular formula but (a)  (b)(c) (d)Problem 8.10Write the structural formula of:(a)  o-Ethylanisole, (b) p-Nitroaniline, (c)  2,3 - Dibromo -1 - phenylpentane,(d)  4-Ethyl-1-fluoro-2-nitrobenzene.solution                         CH3                 CH3 C CH3                                       CH3 Neopentane(2,2-Dimethylpropane)(ii) Position isomerism: When two or more compounds differ in the position of \nsubstituent atom or functional group on \nthe carbon skeleton, they are called position \nisomers and this phenomenon is termed \nas position isomerism. For example, the \nmolecular formula C3H8O represents two alcohols:(iii) Functional group isomerism: Two or more compounds having the same molecular \nformula but different functional groups \nare called functional isomers and this \nphenomenon is termed as functional group \nisomerism. For example, the molecular \nformula C3H6O represents an aldehyde and a ketone:  CH3  CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3 CH3−CHCH2CH3     Pentane Isopentane   (2-Methylbutane)  OH  CH3CH2CH2OH CH3−CH-CH3 Propan-1-ol  Propan-2-olUnit 8.indd   27010/10/2022   10:37:33 AM271(iv) Metamerism: It arises due to different alkyl chains on either side of the functional group in the molecule. For example, C4H10O represents methoxypropane (CH3OC3H7) and ethoxyethane (C2H5OC2H5).8.6.2 StereoisomerismThe compounds that have the same constitution and sequence of covalent bonds \nbut differ in relative positions of their atoms \nor groups in space are called stereoisomers. \nThis special type of isomerism is called as \nstereoisomerism and can be classified as \ngeometrical and optical isomerism. 8.7 FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS IN ORGANIC REACTION MECHANISMIn an organic reaction, the organic molecule (also referred as a substrate) reacts with an \nappropriate attacking reagent and leads to \nthe formation of one or more intermediate(s) \nand finally product(s)The general reaction is depicted as follows : in understanding the reactivity of organic compounds and in planning strategy for their \nsynthesis. In the following sections, we shall learn some of the principles that explain how these \nreactions take place. 8.7.1 Fission of a Covalent Bond\nA covalent bond can get cleaved either by : (i) heterolytic cleavage, or by (ii) homolytic \ncleavage.  In heterolytic cleavage, the bond breaks in such a fashion that the shared pair of electrons remains with  one of the fragments. After heterolysis, one atom has a sextet electronic structure and a positive charge and \nthe other, a valence octet with at least one lone \npair and a negative charge. Thus, heterolytic cleavage of bromomethane will give C+H3 and Br– as shown below. A species having a carbon atom possessing  sextext of electrons and a positive charge is called a carbocation (earlier called carbonium ion). The H3 ion is known as a methyl cation or methyl carbonium ion. Carbocations are \nclassified as primary, secondary or tertiary depending on  whether one, two or three  \ncarbons are directly attached to the positively \ncharged carbon. Some other examples of \ncarbocations are: CH3C+H2 (ethyl cation, a primary carbocation), (CH3)2C+H (isopropyl cation, a secondary carbocation), and (CH3)3C+ (tert-butyl cation, a tertiary carbocation). Carbocations are highly unstable and \nreactive species. Alkyl groups directly \nattached to the positively charged carbon \nstabilise the carbocations due to inductive \nand hyperconjugation effects, which you will \nbe studying in the sections 8.7.5 and 8.7.9. \nThe observed order of carbocation stability \nis: C+H3 \u003c CH3C+H2 \u003c (CH3)2C+H \u003c (CH3)3C+. These carbocations have trigonal planar shape \nwith positively charged carbon being sp2 hybridised. Thus, the shape of C+H3 may be considered as being derived from the overlap \nof three equivalent C(sp2) hybridised orbitals with 1s orbital of each of the three hydrogen Organicmolecule\n(Substrate)[Intermediate]Product(s)Attacking ReagentByproductsSubstrate is that reactant which supplies carbon to the new bond and the other reactant \nis called reagent. If both the reactants \nsupply carbon to the new bond then choice \nis arbitrary and in that case the molecule on \nwhich attention is focused is called substrate.In such a reaction a covalent bond  between two carbon atoms or a carbon and \nsome other atom is broken and a new bond is \nformed. A sequential account of each step, describing details of electron movement, \nenergetics during bond cleavage and bond \nformation, and the rates of transformation \nof reactants into products (kinetics) is \nreferred to as reaction mechanism. The \nknowledge of reaction mechanism helps   O    H  \t\t\t CH3−C-CH3 CH3−CH2—C= O Propanone\t\tPropanalUnit 8.indd   27112/13/2022   10:12:45272atoms. Each bond may be represented as C(sp2)–H(1s) sigma bond. The remaining carbon orbital is perpendicular to the \nmolecular plane and contains no electrons. \n[Fig. 8.3(a)]. Fig. 8.3 (a)  Shape of methyl carbocationThe heterolytic cleavage can also give a species in which carbon gets the shared \npair of electrons. For example, when group \nZ attached to  the carbon leaves without electron pair, the methyl anion  is formed. Such a carbon species carrying a \nnegative charge on carbon atom is called \ncarbanion.  Carbon in carbanion is generally \nsp3 hybridised and its structure is distorted tetrahedron as shown in Fig. 8.3(b). Fig. 8.3 (b)  Shape of methyl carbanionCarbanions are also unstable and reactive \nspecies. The organic reactions which proceed \nthrough heterolytic bond cleavage are called \nionic or heteropolar or just polar reactions. In homolytic cleavage, one of the electrons of the shared pair in a covalent bond goes \nwith each of the bonded atoms. Thus, in \nhomolytic cleavage, the movement of a \nsingle electron takes place instead of an \nelectron pair. The single electron movement \nis shown by ‘half-headed’ (fish hook:) curved arrow. Such cleavage results in \nthe formation of neutral species (atom or \ngroup) which contains an unpaired electron. \nThese species are called free radicals. Like \ncarbocations and carbanions, free radicals are \nalso very reactive. A homolytic cleavage can be  shown as:       Alkyl        free radicalAlkyl radicals are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Alkyl radical stability \nincreases as we proceed from primary to \ntertiary:  ,  Methyl Ethyl Isopropyl Tert-butyl free  free  free free radical radical radical radicalOrganic reactions, which proceed by homolytic fission are called free radical or \nhomopolar or nonpolar reactions. 8.7.2 substrate and reagent Ions are generally not formed in the reactions of organic compounds. Molecules as such participate in the reaction. It is convenient to \nname one reagent as substrate and other as \nreagent. In general, a molecule whose carbon \nis involved in new bond formation is called \nsubstrate and the other one is called reagent. \nWhen carbon-carbon bond is formed, the \nchoice of naming the reactants as substrate \nand reagent is arbitrary and depends on \nmolecule under observation. Example:(i)  CH2 = CH2  +  Br2  → CH2 Br – CH2Br Substrate   Reagent Product(ii)  Nucleophiles and ElectrophilesReagents attack the reactive site of the substrate. The reactive site may be electron Unit 8.indd   27210/10/2022   10:37:34 AM273deficient portion of the molecule (a positive reactive site) e.g., an atom with incomplete \nelectron shell or the positive end of the dipole \nin the molecule. If the attacking species is \nelectron rich, it attacks these sites. If attacking \nspecies is electron deficient, the reactive site \nfor it is that part of the substrate molecule \nwhich can supply electrons, e.g., π electrons \nin a double bond.A reagent that brings an electron pair to the reactive site is called a nucleophile (Nu:) \ni.e., nucleus seeking and the reaction is then \ncalled nucleophilic. A reagent that takes away an electron pair from reactive site is called \nelectrophile (E+) i.e., electron seeking and the reaction is called electrophilic. During a polar organic reaction, a nucleophile attacks an electrophilic centre \nof the substrate which is that specific atom \nor part of the substrate which is electron \ndeficient. Similarly, the electrophiles attack \nat  nucleophilic centre, which is the electron  \nrich centre of the substrate. Thus, the \nelectrophiles receive electron pair from the \nsubstrate when the two undergo bonding \ninteraction. A curved-arrow notation is used \nto show the movement of an electron pair \nfrom the nucleophile to the electrophile. Some \nexamples of nucleophiles are the negatively \ncharged ions with lone pair of electrons  such \nas hydroxide (HO– ), cyanide (NC–) ions and carbanions (R3C:–). Neutral molecules such  as  etc., can also act as nucleophiles due to the presence of lone \npair of electrons. Examples of electrophiles  include carbocations (C+H3) and neutral molecules having functional groups like \ncarbonyl group (\u003eC=O) or alkyl halides  (R3C-X, where X is a halogen atom). The  carbon atom in carbocations has sextet \nconfiguration; hence, it is electron deficient  and can receive a pair of electrons from the \nnucleophiles. In neutral molecules such as \nalkyl halides, due to the polarity of the C-X \nbond a partial positive charge is generated  on the carbon atom and hence the carbon \natom becomes an electrophilic centre at which \na nucleophile can attack.Problem 8.11Using curved-arrow notation, show the formation of reactive  intermediates when \nthe following covalent bonds undergo \nheterolytic cleavage. (a) CH3–SCH3, (b) CH3–CN, (c) CH3–CuSolution Problem 8.12\nGiving justification, categorise the following molecules/ions as nucleophile \nor electrophile:SolutionNucleophiles: HS–,C2H5O–,(CH3)3N:H2N:– These species have unshared pair of electrons, which can be donated and \nshared with an electrophile.Electrophiles: BF3,C1+ H3–C+=O,N+ O2. Reactive sites have only six valence electrons; can accept electron pair from \na nucleophile.Problem 8.13 Identify electrophilic centre in the \nfollowing: CH3CH=O, CH3CN, CH3I.SolutionAmong CH3HC*=O, H3CC*≡N, and  H3C*–I, the starred carbon atoms are electrophilic centers as they will have partial positive charge due to polarity of \nthe bond. 8.7.3 Electron Movement in Organic ReactionsThe movement of electrons in organic reactions can be shown by curved-arrow Unit 8.indd   27311/10/2022   15:21:53274notation. It shows how changes in bonding occur due to electronic redistribution during \nthe reaction. To show the change in position \nof a pair of electrons, curved arrow starts \nfrom the point from where an electron pair is \nshifted and it ends at a location to which the \npair of electron may move. Presentation of shifting of electron pair is given below : (i)   from π bond to      adjacent bond position(ii)  from π bond to      adjacent atom(iii)  from atom to adjacent      bond  positionMovement of single electron is indicated by a single barbed ‘fish hooks’ (i.e. half headed curved arrow). For example, in transfer of \nhydroxide ion giving ethanol and in the \ndissociation of chloromethane, the movement \nof electron using curved arrows can be \ndepicted as follows: 8.7.4 electron displacement effects in covalent Bonds The electron displacement in an organic molecule may take place either in the ground state under the influence of an atom or a \nsubstituent group or in the presence of an \nappropriate attacking reagent. The electron \ndisplacements due to the influence of  an atom or a substituent group present in \nthe molecule cause permanent polarlisation \nof the bond. Inductive effect and resonance \neffects are examples of this type of electron \ndisplacements. Temporary electron \ndisplacement effects are seen in a molecule when a reagent approaches to attack it. \nThis type of electron displacement is called \nelectromeric effect or polarisability effect. \nIn the following sections we will learn about \nthese types of electronic displacements.8.7.5 inductive effectWhen a covalent bond is formed between atoms of different electronegativity, the electron density is more towards the more \nelectronegative atom of the bond. Such a shift \nof electron density results in a polar covalent \nbond. Bond polarity leads to various electronic \neffects in organic compounds. Let us consider cholorethane (CH3CH2Cl) in which the C–Cl bond is a polar covalent bond. It is polarised in such a way that the \ncarbon-1 gains some positive charge (δ+) and the chlorine some negative charge (δ–). The fractional electronic charges on the two \natoms in a polar covalent bond are denoted \nby symbol δ (delta) and the shift of electron \ndensity is shown by an arrow that points from �δ+ to δ– end of the polar bond.δδ+ δ+ δ−CH3→CH2→Cl2 1 In turn carbon-1, which has developed partial positive charge (δ+) draws some electron density towards it from the adjacent \nC-C bond. Consequently, some positive charge \n(δδ+) develops on carbon-2 also, where δδ+ symbolises relatively smaller positive charge �as compared to that on carbon – 1. In other �words, the polar C – Cl bond induces polarity \nin the adjacent bonds. Such polarisation of  �σ-bond caused by the polarisation of adjacent σ-bond is referred to as the inductive effect. \nThis effect is passed on to the subsequent \nbonds also but the effect decreases rapidly \nas the number of intervening bonds increases \nand becomes vanishingly small after three \nbonds. The inductive effect is related to the \nability of substituent(s) to either withdraw or \ndonate electron density to the attached carbon \natom. Based on this ability, the substitutents \ncan be classified as electron-withdrawing or electron donating groups relative to hydrogen. \nHalogens and many other groups such as \nnitro (- NO2), cyano  (- CN), carboxy (- COOH), ester (COOR), aryloxy (-OAr, e.g. – OC6H5), etc. are electron-withdrawing groups. On the other �hand, the alkyl groups like methyl (–CH3) and ethyl (–CH2–CH3) are usually considered as electron donating groups. Unit 8.indd   27410/10/2022   10:37:34 AM275Problem 8.14Which bond is more polar in the following pairs of molecules: (a) H3C-H, H3C-Br (b) H3C-NH2, H3C-OH (c) H3C-OH,  H3C-SH solution(a) C–Br, since Br is more electronegative than H, (b) C–O, (c) C–O Problem 8.15In which C–C bond of CH3CH2CH2Br, the inductive effect is expected to be the least?solutionMagnitude of inductive effect diminishes as the number of intervening bonds increases. Hence, the effect is least in the \nbond between carbon-3 and hydrogen.8.7.6  resonance structureThere are many organic molecules whose behaviour cannot be explained by a single Lewis structure. An example is that of   benzene. Its cyclic structure �containing alternating  C–C single \nand C=C  double bonds shown \nis inadequate for explaining its \ncharacteristic properties.  As per the above representation, benzene should exhibit two different bond lengths, due to C–C single and C=C double bonds. However, as determined experimentally �benzene has a uniform C–C bond distances \nof 139 pm, a value intermediate between the �C–C single(154 pm) and C=C double (134 \npm) bonds. Thus, the structure of benzene \ncannot be represented adequately by the \nabove structure. Further, benzene can be \nrepresented equally well by the energetically \nidentical structures I and II. benzene cannot be adequately represented by any of these structures, rather it is \na hybrid of the two structures (I and II) \ncalled resonance structures. The resonance structures (canonical structures or �contributing structures) are hypothetical �and individually do not represent any �real molecule. They contribute to the actual \nstructure in proportion to their stability. Another example of resonance is provided by nitromethane (CH3NO2) which can be represented by two Lewis structures, (I and \nII). There are two types of N-O bonds in these \nstructures.        however, it is known that the two n–O bonds of nitromethane are of the same length (intermediate between a n–O single bond and a n=O double bond). the actual structure of nitromethane is therefore a resonance hybrid of the two canonical forms I and II.  The energy of actual structure of the molecule (the resonance hybrid) is lower than that of any of the canonical structures. The difference in energy between the actual structure and the \nlowest energy resonance structure is called the \nresonance stabilisation energy or simply \nthe resonance energy. The more the number of important contributing structures, the \nmore is the resonance energy. Resonance is \nparticularly important when the contributing \nstructures are equivalent in energy. The following rules are applied while writing resonance structures:  The resonance structures have (i) the same positions of nuclei and (ii) the same number of \nunpaired electrons. Among the resonance \nstructures, the one which has more number \nof covalent bonds, all the atoms with octet \nof electrons (except hydrogen which has a \nduplet), less separation of opposite charges, (a \nnegative charge if any on more electronegative \natom, a positive charge if any on more \nelectropositive atom) and more dispersal of \ncharge, is more stable than others.  Benzene Therefore, according to the resonance theory (Unit 4) the actual structure of Unit 8.indd   27510/10/2022   10:37:34 AM276Problem 8.16Write resonance structures of CH3COO– and show the movement of electrons by curved arrows.solutionFirst, write the structure and put unshared pairs of valence electrons on \nappropriate atoms. Then draw the arrows \none at a time moving the electrons to get \nthe other structures.Problem 8.17Write resonance structures of  CH2=CH–CHO. Indicate relative stability of the contributing structures.solutionsolutionThe two structures are less important contributors as they involve charge separation. Additionally, structure \nI contains a carbon atom with an incomplete octet.8.7.7 resonance effectThe resonance effect is defined as ‘the polarity produced in the molecule by the interaction of two π-bonds or between a π-bond and lone pair of electrons present on an adjacent atom’. The effect is transmitted through the \nchain. There are two types of resonance or \nmesomeric effect designated as R or M effect.(i) Positive Resonance Effect (+R effect) \nIn this effect, the transfer of electrons is away from an atom or substituent group attached \nto the conjugated system. This electron \ndisplacement makes certain positions in the \nmolecule of high electron densities. This effect \nin aniline is shown as : Stability: I \u003e II \u003e III[I: Most stable,  more number of covalent \nbonds, each carbon and oxygen atom has \nan octet and no separation of opposite \ncharge II: negative charge on more \nelectronegative atom and positive charge \non more electropositive atom; III: does \nnot contribute as oxygen has positive \ncharge and carbon has negative charge, \nhence least stable].  Problem 8.18Explain why the following two structures, \nI and II cannot be the major contributors \nto the real structure of CH3COOCH3.(ii) Negative Resonance Effect (- R effect)This effect is observed when the transfer of electrons is towards the atom or substituent \ngroup attached to the conjugated system. \nFor example in nitrobenzene this electron \ndisplacement can be depicted as : The atoms or substituent groups, which represent +R or  –R electron displacement effects are as follows : +R effect: – halogen, –OH, –OR, –OCOR, –NH2, –NHR, –NR2, –NHCOR, – R effect: – COOH, –CHO, \u003eC=O, – CN, –NO2 Unit 8.indd   27610/10/2022   10:37:35 AM277The presence of alternate single and double bonds in an open chain or cyclic system is termed as a conjugated system. These \nsystems often show abnormal behaviour. \nThe examples are 1,3- butadiene, aniline \nand nitrobenzene etc. In such systems, the �π-electrons are delocalised and the system develops polarity.8.7.8 electromeric effect (e effect)It is a temporary effect. The organic compounds having a multiple bond (a double or triple bond) show this effect in the presence of \nan attacking reagent only. It is defined as \nthe complete transfer of a shared pair of  π-electrons to one of the atoms joined by a \nmultiple bond on the demand of an attacking \nreagent. The effect is annulled as soon as the \nattacking reagent is removed from the domain \nof the reaction. It is represented by E and the \nshifting of the electrons is shown by a curved \narrow (). There are two distinct types of electromeric effect. \n(i) Positive Eelctromeric Effect (+E effect) In \nthis effect the π−electrons of the multiple \nbond are transferred to that atom to which \nthe reagent gets attached. For example: system or to an atom with an unshared  p orbital. The σ electrons of C—H bond of the alkyl group enter into partial conjugation with \nthe attached unsaturated system or with the \nunshared p orbital. Hyperconjugation is a permanent effect.To understand hyperconjugation effect, let us take an example of CH3 C+H2 (ethyl cation) in which the positively charged carbon atom has \nan empty p orbital. One of the C-H bonds of \nthe methyl group can align in the plane of this \nempty p orbital and the electrons constituting the C-H bond in plane with this p orbital can \nthen be delocalised into the empty p orbital \nas depicted in Fig. 8.4 (a).(ii) Negative Electromeric Effect (–E effect) In \nthis effect the π - electrons of the multiple \nbond are transferred to that atom to which \nthe attacking reagent does not get attached. \nFor example:When inductive and electromeric effects operate in opposite directions, the electomeric \neffect predominates.8.7.9 hyperconjugationHyperconjugation is a general stabilising interaction. It involves delocalisation of  σ electrons of C—H bond of an alkyl group directly attached to an atom of unsaturated Fig. 8.4(a) Orbital diagram showing hyperconjugation in ethyl cationThis type of overlap stabilises the carbocation because electron density from \nthe adjacent σ bond helps in dispersing the \npositive charge. In general, greater the number of alkyl groups attached to a positively charged carbon atom, the greater is the hyperconjugation \ninteraction and stabilisation of the cation. \nThus, we have the following relative stability \nof carbocations :  Unit 8.indd   27710/10/2022   10:37:35 AM278Hyperconjugation is also possible in alkenes and alkylarenes. Delocalisation of electrons by hyperconjugation in the case of alkene can be depicted as in Fig. 8.4(b).Problem 8.19 \nExplain why (CH3)3C+ is more stable than CH3C+H2 and C+H3 is the least stable  cation. solution Hyperconjugation interaction in (CH3)3C+  is greater than in CH3C+H2 as the (CH3)3C+   has nine C-H bonds. In C+H3, vacant p orbital is perpendicular to the plane  in which C-H bonds lie; hence cannot overlap with it. Thus, C+H3 lacks hyperconjugative stability. 8.7.10 types of Organic reactions and MechanismsOrganic reactions can be classified into the following categories:(i) Substitution reactions(ii) Addition reactions(iii) Elimination reactions(iv) Rearrangement reactionsYou will be studying these reactions in  Unit 9 and later in class XII.8.8 methOds OF PuriFicatiOn OF Organic cOmPOundsOnce an organic compound is extracted from a natural source or synthesised in the laboratory, it is essential to purify it. Various  \nmethods used for the purification of organic \ncompounds are based on the nature of the \ncompound and the impurity present in it. The common techniques used for purification are as follows :(i) Sublimation(ii) Crystallisation(iii) Distillation(iv) Differential extraction and(v) Chromatography Finally, the purity of a compound is  ascertained by determining its melting or boiling point. Most of the pure compounds have sharp melting points and boiling points. New methods of checking the purity of an \norganic compound are based on different Fig. 8.4(b) Orbital diagram showing hyperconjugation in propeneThere are various ways of looking at the hyperconjugative effect. One of the way is to \nregard C—H bond as possessing partial ionic \ncharacter due to resonance.The hyperconjugation may also be regarded as no bond resonance.Unit 8.indd   27810/10/2022   10:37:35 AM279types of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques.8.8.1 sublimationYou have learnt earlier that on heating, some solid substances change from solid to vapour state without passing through liquid state. \nThe purification technique based on the above \nprinciple is known as sublimation and is used \nto separate sublimable compounds from non-\nsublimable impurities.8.8.2 crystallisationThis is one of the most commonly used techniques for the purification of solid organic compounds. It is based on the difference in \nthe solubilities of the compound and the \nimpurities in a suitable solvent. The impure \ncompound is dissolved in a solvent in which it \nis sparingly soluble at room temperature but \nappreciably soluble at higher temperature. \nThe solution is concentrated to get a nearly \nsaturated solution. On cooling the solution, \npure compound crystallises out and is \nremoved by filtration. The filtrate (mother \nliquor) contains impurities and small quantity \nof the compound. If the compound is highly \nsoluble in one solvent and very little  soluble \nin another solvent, crystallisation can be \nsatisfactorily carried out in a mixture of these \nsolvents. Impurities, which impart colour to \nthe solution are removed by adsorbing over \nactivated charcoal. Repeated crystallisation \nbecomes necessary for the purification \nof compounds containing impurities of \ncomparable solubilities.8.8.3 distillationThis important method is used to separate (i) volatile liquids from nonvolatile impurities \nand (ii) the liquids having sufficient difference in their boiling points. Liquids having \ndifferent boiling points vaporise at different \ntemperatures. The vapours are cooled and \nthe liquids so formed are collected separately. \nChloroform (b.p 334 K) and aniline (b.p. 457 \nK) are easily separated by the technique of \ndistillation (Fig 8.5). The liquid mixture is \ntaken in a round bottom flask and heated carefully. On boiling, the vapours of lower boiling component are formed first. The \nvapours are condensed by using a condenser \nand the liquid is collected in a receiver.  \nThe vapours of higher boiling component \nform later and the liquid can be collected \nseparately.Fractional Distillation: If the difference in boiling points of two liquids is not much, simple distillation cannot be used to separate \nthem.  The vapours of such liquids are formed \nwithin the same temperature range and are \ncondensed simultaneously.  The technique of \nfractional distillation is used in such cases. In \nthis technique, vapours of a liquid mixture are \npassed through a fractionating column before \ncondensation. The fractionating column is \nfitted over the mouth of the round bottom \nflask (Fig.8.6, page 280).Vapours of the liquid with higher boiling point condense before the vapours of the \nliquid with lower boiling point. The vapours \nrising up in the fractionating column become \nricher in more volatile component. By the Fig.8.5 Simple distillation. The vapours of a substance formed are condensed and the liquid is collected in conical flask.Unit 8.indd   27910/10/2022   10:37:35 AM280time the vapours reach to the top of the fractionating column, these are rich in the \nmore volatile component. Fractionating \ncolumns are available in various sizes and \ndesigns as shown in Fig.8.7. A fractionating \ncolumn provides many surfaces for heat \nexchange between the ascending vapours \nand the descending condensed liquid.  Some \nof the condensing liquid in the fractionating \ncolumn obtains heat from the ascending \nvapours and revaporises.  The vapours thus \nbecome richer in low boiling component.  The \nvapours of low boiling component ascend \nto the top of the column. On reaching the \ntop, the vapours become pure in low boiling \ncomponent and pass through the condenser \nand the pure liquid is collected in a receiver.  \nAfter a series of successive distillations, the \nremaining liquid in the distillation flask gets \nenriched in high boiling component. Each \nsuccessive condensation and vaporisation Fig.8.7 Different types of fractionating columns.unit in the fractionating column is called a theoretical plate.  Commercially, columns with hundreds of plates are available.One of the technological applications of fractional distillation is to separate different \nfractions of crude oil in petroleum industry.Fig.8.6  Fractional distillation. The vapours of lower boiling \nfraction reach the top of the column first followed by \nvapours of higher boiling fractions.Distillation under reduced \npressure: This method is used to purify liquids having \nvery high boiling points and \nthose, which decompose at \nor below their boiling points. \nSuch liquids are made to boil \nat a temperature lower than \ntheir normal boiling points \nby reducing the pressure on \ntheir surface. A liquid boils \nat a temperature at which its \nvapour pressure is equal to \nthe external pressure. The \npressure is reduced with \nthe help of a water pump \nor vacuum pump (Fig.8.8). \nGlycerol can be separated from �spent-lye in soap industry by \nusing this technique.  Unit 8.indd   28010/10/2022   10:37:35 AM281Fig.8.8 Distillation under reduced pressure. A liquid boils at a temperature below its vapour pressure by reducing the pressure.Steam Distillation: This technique is applied to separate substances which are steam volatile and are immiscible with water. \nIn steam distillation, steam from a steam \ngenerator is passed through a heated flask \ncontaining the liquid to be distilled. The \nmixture of steam and the volatile organic \ncompound is condensed and collected. The \ncompound is later separated from water using \na separating funnel. In steam distillation, \nthe liquid boils when the sum of vapour \npressures due to the organic liquid (p1) and that due to water (p2) becomes equal to the atmospheric pressure (p), i.e. p =p1+ p2. Since p1 is lower than p, the organic liquid vaporises at lower temperature than its \nboiling point. Thus, if one of the substances in the mixture is water and the other, a water insoluble substance, then the mixture will boil \nclose to but below, 373K. A mixture of water \nand the substance is obtained which can \nbe separated by using a separating funnel.  \nAniline is separated by this technique from �aniline – water mixture  (Fig.8.9, Page 282).8.8.4 differential extraction When an organic compound is present in an aqueous medium, it is separated by shaking it with an organic solvent in which it is more \nsoluble than in water. The organic solvent and \nthe aqueous solution should be immiscible \nwith each other so that they form two distinct \nlayers which can be separated by separatory \nfunnel. The organic solvent is later removed \nby distillation or by evaporation to get back  the compound. Differential extraction is \ncarried out in a separatory funnel as shown in  Fig. 8.10 (Page 282). If the organic compound \nis less soluble in the organic solvent, a very \nlarge quantity of solvent would be required \nto extract even a very small quantity of the \ncompound. The technique of continuous \nextraction is employed in such cases. In this \ntechnique same solvent is repeatedly used for \nextraction of the compound.  8.8.5  chromatographyChromatography is an important technique extensively used to separate mixtures into their components, purify compounds and \nalso to test the purity of compounds. The Unit 8.indd   28110/10/2022   10:37:36 AM282name chromatography is based on the Greek word chroma, for colour since the method was first used for the separation of coloured \nsubstances found in plants. In this technique, \nthe mixture of substances is applied onto a \nstationary phase, which may be a solid or a \nliquid. A pure solvent, a mixture of solvents, \nor a gas is allowed to move slowly over the \nstationary phase. The components of the mixture get gradually separated from one \nanother. The moving phase is called the \nmobile phase.Based on the principle involved, chromatography is classified into different \ncategories. Two of these are:(a) Adsorption chromatography, and (b) Partition chromatography.  a) Adsorption Chromatography: Adsor-ption chromatography is based on the fact that different compounds are adsorbed on \nan adsorbent to different degrees. Commonly \nused adsorbents are silica gel and alumina.  \nWhen a mobile phase is allowed to move  over a stationary phase (adsorbent), the \ncomponents of the mixture move by varying distances over the stationary phase. Following \nare two main types of chromatographic \ntechniques based on the principle of differential \nadsorption.  (a)  Column chromatography, and (b) Thin layer chromatography.Fig.8.10 Differential extraction. Extraction of com-pound takes place based on difference in solubility Fig.8.9  Steam distillation.  Steam volatile component volatilizes, the vapours condense in the condenser and the liquid collects in conical flask.Unit 8.indd   28210/10/2022   10:37:36 AM283Column Chromatography: Column chromatography involves separation of \na mixture over a  column of adsorbent \n(stationary phase) packed in a glass tube. \nThe column is fitted with a stopcock at its \nlower end (Fig. 8.11).  The mixture adsorbed \non adsorbent is placed on the top of the \nadsorbent column packed in a glass tube.  \nAn appropriate eluant which is a liquid or a \nmixture of liquids is allowed to flow down the \ncolumn slowly.  Depending upon the degree to \nwhich the compounds are adsorbed, complete \nseparation takes place.  The most readily \nadsorbed substances are retained near the top \nand others come down to various distances \nin the column (Fig.8.11).The glass plate is then placed in a closed jar \ncontaining the eluant (Fig. 8.12a). As the \neluant rises up the plate, the components of \nthe mixture move up along with the eluant to \ndifferent distances depending on their degree \nof adsorption and separation takes place. \nThe relative adsorption of each component \nof the mixture is expressed in terms of its \nretardation factor i.e. Rf value (Fig.8.12 b).Rf  = Distance moved by the substance from base line (x)       Distance moved by the solvent from base line (y)Fig.8.11   Column chromatography. Different stages of separation of components \nof a mixture.Thin Layer Chromatography: Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is another type of \nadsorption chromatography, which involves \nseparation of substances of a mixture over \na thin layer of an adsorbent coated on glass \nplate.  A thin layer (about 0.2mm thick) of \nan adsorbent (silica gel or alumina) is spread \nover a glass plate of suitable size. The plate \nis known as thin layer chromatography plate \nor chromaplate. The solution of the mixture \nto be separated is applied as a small spot \nabout 2 cm above one end of the TLC plate.  The spots of coloured compounds are visible on TLC plate due to their original colour.  \nThe spots of colourless compounds, which are \ninvisible to the eye but fluoresce in ultraviolet \nlight, can be detected by putting the plate under \nultraviolet light. Another detection technique \nis to place the plate in a covered jar containing \na few crystals of iodine. Spots of compounds, \nwhich adsorb iodine, will show up as brown \nspots.  Sometimes an appropriate reagent \nmay also be sprayed on the plate. For example, \namino acids may be detected by spraying the \nplate with ninhydrin solution (Fig.8.12b).

The spots of the separated colourless compounds may be observed either under ultraviolet light or by \nthe use of an appropriate spray reagent as \ndiscussed under thin layer chromatography.  8.9 qualitatiVe analysis OF Organic cOmPOundsThe elements present in organic compounds are carbon and hydrogen. In addition to these, they may also contain oxygen, nitrogen, \nsulphur, halogens and phosphorus.8.9.1  detection of carbon and hydrogenCarbon and hydrogen are detected by heating the compound with copper(II) oxide.

This extract is known as sodium fusion \nextract.(A) Test for Nitrogen \nThe sodium fusion extract is boiled with  iron(II) sulphate and then acidified with Partition Chromatography: Partition chromatography is based on continuous \ndifferential partitioning of components of \na mixture between stationary and mobile \nphases. Paper chromatography is a type \nof partition chromatography. In paper \nchromatography, a special quality paper \nknown as chromatography paper is used. \nChromatography paper contains water trapped \nin it, which acts as the stationary phase.A strip of chromatography paper spotted at the base with the solution of the mixture is suspended in a suitable solvent or a mixture \nof solvents (Fig. 8.13). This solvent acts as the \nmobile phase. The solvent rises up the paper \nby capillary action and flows over the spot. The \npaper selectively retains different components \naccording to their differing partition in the \ntwo phases.   The paper strip so developed is \nknown as a chromatogram.  The spots of the \nseparated coloured compounds are visible at \ndifferent heights from the position of initial Fig.8.13 Paper chromatography.

Sodium cyanide first reacts  with iron(II)sulphate and forms sodium \nhexacyanidoferrate(II). On heating with \nconcentrated sulphuric acid some iron(II) \nions are oxidised to iron(III) ions which \nreact with sodium hexacyanidoferrate(II) \nto produce iron(III) hexacyanidoferrate(II) \n(ferriferrocyanide) which is Prussian blue in \ncolour. 6CN– + Fe2+  →   [Fe(CN)6]4– 3[Fe(CN)6]4– + 4Fe3+  Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3.xH2O Prussian blue(B) Test for Sulphur (a)  The sodium fusion extract is acidified with acetic acid and lead acetate is added \nto it.

It helps chemists in the determination of mass per \ncent of elements present in a compound. You \nhave learnt in Unit-1 that mass per cent of \nelements is required for the determination of \nemperical and molecular formula.The percentage composition of elements present in an organic compound is determined \nby the following methods:8.10.1  carbon and Hydrogen Both carbon and hydrogen are estimated in one experiment. A known mass of an organic compound is burnt in the presence of  excess \nof oxygen and copper(II) oxide.

These tubes are connected in series \n(Fig. 8.14). The increase in masses of calcium \nchloride and potassium hydroxide gives the \namounts of water and carbon dioxide from \nwhich the percentages of carbon and hydrogen are calculated.Let the mass of organic compound be  m g, mass of water and carbon dioxide \nproduced be m1 and m2 g respectively;Percentage of carbon=  21210044mm×××Percentage of hydrogen  = 1210018mm×××  Problem 8.20 \nOn complete combustion, 0.246 g of an \norganic compound gave 0.198g of carbon \ndioxide and 0.1014g of water.

The nature of the covalent bonding \nin organic compounds can be described in terms of orbitals hybridisation concept, \naccording to which carbon can have sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised orbitals. The sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised carbons are found in compounds like methane, ethene and ethyne respectively. \nThe tetrahedral shape of methane, planar shape of ethene and linear shape of ethyne can \nbe understood on the basis of this concept. A sp3 hybrid orbital can overlap with 1s orbital of hydrogen to give a carbon - hydrogen (C–H) single bond (sigma, σ bond). Overlap of a sp2 orbital of one carbon with sp2 orbital of another results in the formation of a carbon–carbon σ bond. The unhybridised p orbitals on two adjacent carbons can undergo lateral (side-\nby-side) overlap to give a pi (π) bond. Organic compounds can be represented by various \nstructural formulas. The three dimensional representation of organic compounds on paper \ncan be drawn by wedge and dash formula.Organic compounds can be classified on the basis of their structure or the functional groups they contain. A functional group is an atom or group of atoms bonded together in a \nunique fashion and which determines the physical and  chemical properties of the compounds. \nThe naming of the organic compounds is carried out by following a set of rules laid down by \nthe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (iuPac). In IUPAC nomenclature, the names are correlated with the structure in such a way that the reader can deduce the structure from the name.Organic reaction mechanism concepts are based on the structure of the substrate molecule, fission of a covalent bond, the attacking reagents, the electron displacement effects \nand the conditions of the reaction. These organic reactions involve breaking and making \nof covalent bonds. A covalent bond may be cleaved in heterolytic or homolytic fashion. \nA heterolytic cleavage yields carbocations or carbanions, while a homolytic cleavage gives �free radicals as reactive intermediate. Reactions proceeding through heterolytic cleavage \ninvolve the complimentary pairs of reactive species. These are electron pair donor known as �nucleophile and an electron pair acceptor known as electrophile. The inductive, resonance, electromeric and hyperconjugation effects may help in the polarisation of a bond making certain carbon atom or other atom positions as places of low or high electron densities.Organic reactions can be broadly classified into following types; substitution, addition, elimination and rearrangement reactions. Purification, qualitative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds are carried out for determining their structures. The methods of purification namely : sublimation, distillation \nand differential extraction are based on the difference in one or more physical properties. \nChromatography is a useful technique of separation, identification and purification of \ncompounds. It is classified into two categories : adsorption and partition chromatography. \nAdsorption chromatography is based on differential adsorption of various components of a \nmixture on an adsorbent. Partition chromatography involves continuous partitioning of the \ncomponents of a mixture between stationary and mobile phases. After getting the compound \nin a pure form, its qualitative analysis is carried out for detection of elements present in it. \nNitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus are detected by lassaigne’s test. Carbon and hydrogen are estimated by determining the amounts of carbon dioxide and water produced. Nitrogen is estimated by dumas or Kjeldahl’s method and halogens by Carius method. Sulphur and phosphorus are estimated by oxidising them to sulphuric and phosphoric acids \nrespectively. The percentage of oxygen is usually determined by difference between the total percentage (100) and the sum of percentages of all other elements present.Unit 8.indd   29110/10/2022   10:37:39 AM292EXERCISES8.1 What are hybridisation states of each carbon atom in the following compounds ?

    "input": "Science134Light – Reflection andRefraction9CHAPTERWe see a variety of objects in the world around us. However, we areunable to see anything in a dark room. On lighting up the room,things become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, thesunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it.\nThis reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things.We are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmittedthrough it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomenaassociated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling\nof stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a mediumand so on.  A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.By observing the common optical phenomena around us, we mayconclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a smallsource of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to thisstraight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.More to Know!If an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small, light has a tendency tobend around it and not walk in a straight line – an effect known as the diffraction of\nlight. Then the straight-line treatment of optics using rays fails. To explain phenomenasuch as diffraction, light is thought of as a wave, the details of which you will studyin higher classes. Again, at the beginning of the 20th century, it became known thatthe wave theory of light often becomes inadequate for treatment of the interaction of\nlight with matter, and light often behaves somewhat like a stream of particles. Thisconfusion about the true nature of light continued for some years till a modern\nquantum theory of light emerged in which light is neither a ‘wave’ nor a ‘particle’ –\nthe new theory reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature.In this Chapter, we shall study the phenomena of reflection andrefraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic\nconcepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in\nnature. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the reflection of lightby spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in reallife situations.9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHTA highly polished surface, such as a mirror, reflects most of the lightfalling on it. You are already familiar with the laws of reflection of light.Light – Reflection and Refraction135Let us recall these laws –(i)The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and(ii)The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidenceand the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.These laws of reflection are applicable to all types of reflecting surfacesincluding spherical surfaces. You are familiar with the formation of imageby a plane mirror. What are the properties of the image? Image formedby a plane mirror is always virtual and erect.  The size of the image isequal to that of the object.  The image formed is as far behind the mirroras the object is in front of it.  Further, the image is laterally inverted.How would the images be when the reflecting surfaces are curved? Let\nus explore.Activity 9.1Activity 9.1Activity 9.1Activity 9.1Activity 9.1nTake a large shining spoon. Try to view your face in its curvedsurface.nDo you get the image?  Is it smaller or larger?nMove the spoon slowly away from your face. Observe the image.How does it change?nReverse the spoon and repeat the Activity.  How does the image\nlook like now?nCompare the characteristics of the image on the two surfaces.The curved surface of a shining spoon could be considered as a curvedmirror.  The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the sphericalmirror.  The reflecting surface of such mirrors can be considered to forma part of the surface of a sphere.  Such mirrors, whose reflecting surfacesare spherical, are called spherical mirrors.  We shall now study aboutspherical mirrors in some detail.9.2 SPHERIC9.2 SPHERIC9.2 SPHERIC9.2 SPHERIC9.2 SPHERICAL MIRRORSAL MIRRORSAL MIRRORSAL MIRRORSAL MIRRORSThe reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards oroutwards.  A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards,that is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is calleda convex mirror. The schematic representation of these mirrors is shownin Fig. 9.1. You may note in these diagrams that the backof the mirror is shaded.You may now understand that the surface of the spooncurved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirrorand the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can beapproximated to a convex mirror.Before we move further on spherical mirrors, we need torecognise and understand the meaning of a few terms. Theseterms are commonly used in discussions about sphericalmirrors. The centre of the reflecting surface of a sphericalmirror is a point called the pole.  It lies on the surface of themirror.  The pole is usually represented by the letter P.Figure 9.1Figure 9.1Figure 9.1Figure 9.1Figure 9.1Schematic representation of spherical\nmirrors; the shaded side is non-reflecting.(a) Concave mirror(b) Convex mirrorScience136The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere.This sphere has a centre. This point is called the centre of curvature ofthe spherical mirror. It is represented by the letter C. Please note that thecentre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflectingsurface. The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.However, it lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror. You maynote this in Fig.9.2 (a) and (b). The radius of the sphere of which the\nreflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radiusof curvature of the mirror. It is represented by the letter R. You may notethat the distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. Imagine a straight\nline passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a sphericalmirror. This line is called the principal axis. Remember that principalaxis is normal to the mirror at its pole. Let us understand an important\nterm related to mirrors, through an Activity.Activity 9.2Activity 9.2Activity 9.2Activity 9.2Activity 9.2CAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or even into a mirrorreflecting sunlight. It may damage your eyes.nHold a concave mirror in your hand and direct its reflecting surfacetowards the Sun.nDirect the light reflected by the mirror on to a sheet of paper held\nclose to the mirror.nMove the sheet of paper back and forth gradually until you find\non the paper sheet a bright, sharp spot of light.nHold the mirror and the paper in the same position for a few\nminutes. What do you observe? Why?The paper at first begins to burn producing smoke. Eventually itmay even catch fire. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is convergedat a point, as a sharp, bright spot by the mirror. In fact, this spot of lightis the image of the Sun on the sheet of paper. This point isthe focus of the concave mirror. The heat produced due tothe concentration of sunlight ignites the paper. The distanceof this image from the position of the mirror gives theapproximate value of focal length of the mirror.Let us try to understand this observation with the helpof a ray diagram.Observe Fig.9.2 (a) closely. A number of rays parallelto the principal axis are falling on a concave mirror. Observethe reflected rays. They are all meeting/intersecting at a\npoint on the principal axis of the mirror.  This point is calledthe principal focus of the concave mirror. Similarly, observeFig. 9.2 (b). How are the rays parallel to the principal axis,reflected by a convex mirror? The reflected rays appear tocome from a point on the principal axis. This point is calledthe principal focus of the convex mirror. The principal focusis represented by the letter F. The distance between thepole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is calledthe focal length. It is represented by the letter f.Figure 9.2Figure 9.2Figure 9.2Figure 9.2Figure 9.2(a) Concave mirror\n(b)     Convex mirror(b)(a)Light – Reflection and Refraction137The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is by-and-large spherical.The surface, then, has a circular outline. The diameter of the reflectingsurface of spherical mirror is called its aperture. In Fig.9.2, distance MNrepresents the aperture. We shall consider in our discussion only suchspherical mirrors whose aperture is much smaller than its radius of\ncurvature.Is there a relationship between the radius of curvature R, and focallength f, of a spherical mirror? For spherical mirrors of small apertures,the radius of curvature is found to be equal to twice the focal length. Weput this as R = 2f .  This implies that the principal focus of a sphericalmirror lies midway between the pole and centre of curvature.9.2.1  Image Formation by Spherical MirrorsYou have studied about the image formation by plane mirrors. You alsoknow the nature, position and relative size of the images formed by them.How about the images formed by spherical mirrors? How can we locatethe image formed by a concave mirror for different positions of the object?Are the images real or virtual? Are they enlarged, diminished or havethe same size? We shall explore this with an Activity.Activity 9.3Activity 9.3Activity 9.3Activity 9.3Activity 9.3You have already learnt a way of determining the focal length of aconcave mirror. In Activity 9.2, you have seen that the sharp brightspot of light you got on the paper is, in fact, the image of the Sun. Itwas a tiny, real, inverted image. You got the approximate focal lengthof the concave mirror by measuring the distance of the image from\nthe mirror.nTake a concave mirror.  Find out its approximate focal length inthe way described above. Note down the value of focal length. (Youcan also find it out by obtaining image of a distant object on a\nsheet of paper.)nMark a line on a Table with a chalk.  Place the concave mirror on\na stand.  Place the stand over the line such that its pole lies over\nthe line.nDraw with a chalk two more lines parallel to the previous linesuch that the distance between any two successive lines is equalto the focal length of the mirror. These lines will now correspondto the positions of the points P, F and C, respectively. Remember –For a spherical mirror of small aperture, the principal focus F liesmid-way between the pole P and the centre of curvature C.nKeep a bright object, say a burning candle, at a position far beyond\nC.  Place a paper screen and move it in front of the mirror till you\nobtain a sharp bright image of the candle flame on it.nObserve the image carefully.  Note down its nature, position and\nrelative size with respect to the object size.nRepeat the activity by placing the candle – (a) just beyond C,(b) at C, (c) between F and C, (d) at F, and (e) between P and F.nIn one of the cases, you may not get the image on the screen.\nIdentify the position of the object in such a case. Then, look for its\nvirtual image in the mirror itself.nNote down and tabulate your observations.Science138You will see in the above Activity that the nature, position and size ofthe image formed by a concave mirror depends on the position of theobject in relation to points P, F and C. The image formed is real for somepositions of the object. It is found to be a virtual image for a certain otherposition. The image is either magnified, reduced or has the same size,depending on the position of the object. A summary of these observations\nis given for your reference in Table 9.1.Table 9.1 Image formation by a concave mirror for different positions of the objectPosition of thePosition of theSize of theNature of theobjectimageimageimageAt infinityAt the focus FHighly diminished,Real and invertedpoint-sizedBeyond CBetween F and CDiminishedReal and invertedAt CAt CSame sizeReal and invertedBetween C and FBeyond CEnlargedReal and invertedAt FAt infinityHighly enlargedReal and invertedBetween P and FBehind the mirrorEnlargedVirtual and erect9.2.2Representation of Images Formed by SphericalMirrors Using Ray DiagramsWe can also study the formation of images by spherical mirrors bydrawing ray diagrams. Consider an extended object, of finite size, placedin front of a spherical mirror. Each small portion of the extended objectacts like a point source. An infinite number of rays originate from eachof these points. To construct the ray diagrams, in order to locate the\nimage of an object, an arbitrarily large number of rays emanating from apoint could be considered.  However, it is more convenient to consideronly two rays, for the sake of clarity of the ray diagram. These rays areso chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the\nmirror.The intersection of at least two reflected rays give the position of imageof the point object.  Any two of the following rays can be considered for\nlocating the image.(i)A ray parallel to the principalaxis, after reflection, will passthrough the principal focusin case of a concave mirroror appear to diverge from\nthe principal focus incase of a convex mirror.This is illustrated in Fig.9.3(a) and (b).(a)(b)FigureFigureFigureFigureFigure 9.39.39.39.39.3Light – Reflection and Refraction139(ii)A ray passing through theprincipal focus of a concavemirror or a ray which isdirected towards theprincipal focus of a convexmirror, after reflection, willemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nillustrated in Fig.9.4 (a)\nand (b).(iii)A ray passing through the\ncentre of curvature of aconcave mirror or directed\nin the direction of the centre\nof curvature of a convex\nmirror, after reflection, isreflected back along the\nsame path.  This is\nillustrated in Fig.9.5 (a) and\n(b). The light rays come back\nalong the same path\nbecause the incident raysfall on the mirror along thenormal to the reflecting\nsurface.(iv)A ray incident obliquely to\nthe principal axis, towardsa point P (pole of the mirror),\non the concave mirror\n[Fig. 9.6 (a)] or a convex\nmirror [Fig. 9.6 (b)], is\nreflected obliquely. The\nincident and reflected rays\nfollow the laws of reflection\nat the point of incidence(point P), making equalangles with the principal axis.(a)(b)Figure 9.4Figure 9.4Figure 9.4Figure 9.4Figure 9.4Remember that in all the above cases the laws of reflection are followed.At the point of incidence, the incident ray is reflected in such a way thatthe angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.(a)Image formation by Concave MirrorFigure 9.7 illustrates the ray diagrams for the formation of image\nby a concave mirror for various positions of the object.(b)(a)Figure 9.5Figure 9.5Figure 9.5Figure 9.5Figure 9.5(a)(b)Figure 9.6Figure 9.6Figure 9.6Figure 9.6Figure 9.6Science140Figure 9.7Figure 9.7Figure 9.7Figure 9.7Figure 9.7 Ray diagrams for the image formation by a concave mirrorActivity 9.4Activity 9.4Activity 9.4Activity 9.4Activity 9.4nDraw neat ray diagrams for each position of the object shown inTable 9.1.nYou may take any two of the rays mentioned in the previous sectionfor locating the image.nCompare your diagram with those given in Fig. 9.7.nDescribe the nature, position and relative size of the image formedin each case.nTabulate the results in a convenient format.Uses of concave mirrorsConcave mirrors are commonly used in torches, search-lights andvehicles headlights to get powerful parallel beams of light. They areoften used as shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face. Thedentists use concave mirrors to see large images of the teeth of patients.Large concave mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to produceheat in solar furnaces.(b)Image formation by a Convex Mirror\nWe studied the image formation by a concave mirror. Now we shallstudy the formation of image by a convex mirror.Light – Reflection and Refraction141We consider two positions of the object for studying the image formedby a convex mirror.  First is when the object is at infinity and the secondposition is when the object is at a finite distance from the mirror. The raydiagrams for the formation of image by a convex mirror for these twopositions of the object are shown in Fig.9.8 (a) and (b), respectively.  Theresults are summarised in Table 9.2.Activity 9.5Activity 9.5Activity 9.5Activity 9.5Activity 9.5nTake a convex mirror.  Hold it in one hand.nHold a pencil in the upright position in the other hand.nObserve the image of the pencil in the mirror. Is the image erect orinverted?  Is it diminished or enlarged?nMove the pencil away from the mirror slowly. Does the imagebecome smaller or larger?nRepeat this Activity carefully.  State whether the image will move\ncloser to or farther away from the focus as the object is movedaway from the mirror?Figure 9.8 Figure 9.8 Figure 9.8 Figure 9.8 Figure 9.8 Formation of image by a convex mirrorYou have so far studied the image formation by a plane mirror, aconcave mirror and a convex mirror.  Which of these mirrors will give thefull image of a large object? Let us explore through an Activity.Activity 9.6Activity 9.6Activity 9.6Activity 9.6Activity 9.6nObserve the image of a distant object, say a distant tree, in a\nplane mirror.nCould you see a full-length image?Table 9.2 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a convex mirrorPosition of thePosition of theSize of theNature of theobjectimageimageimageAt infinityAt the focus F,Highly diminished,Virtual and erectbehind the mirrorpoint-sizedBetween infinityBetween P and F,DiminishedVirtual and erectand the pole P ofbehind the mirrorthe mirrorScience142nTry with plane mirrors of different sizes. Did you see the entireobject in the image?nRepeat this Activity with a concave mirror.  Did the mirror showfull length image of the object?nNow try using a convex mirror. Did you succeed? Explain yourobservations with reason.You can see a full-length image of a tall building/tree in a smallconvex mirror. One such mirror is fitted in a wall of Agra Fort facing TajMahal. If you visit the Agra Fort, try to observe the full image of TajMahal. To view distinctly, you should stand suitably at the terraceadjoining the wall.Uses of convex mirrorsConvex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view (wing) mirrors invehicles. These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling thedriver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convexmirrors are preferred because they always give an erect, thoughdiminished, image. Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curvedoutwards. Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view much largerarea than would be possible with a plane mirror.QUESTIONS?1.Define the principal focus of a concave mirror.2.The radius of curvature of a spherical mirror is 20 cm.  What is its focallength?3.Name a mirror that can give an erect and enlarged image of an object.4.Why do we prefer a convex mirror as a rear-view mirror in vehicles?9.2.3 Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical MirrorsWhile dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors, we shallfollow a set of sign conventions called the New Cartesian SignConvention. In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as theorigin (Fig. 9.9).  The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis\n(X’X) of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows –(i)The object is always placed to the left of the mirror. This impliesthat the light from the object falls on the mirror from the left-hand\nside.(ii)All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the\npole of the mirror.(iii)All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along\n+ x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of\nthe origin (along – x-axis) are taken as negative.(iv)Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis(along + y-axis) are taken as positive.(v)Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis(along –y-axis) are taken as negative.Light – Reflection and Refraction143The New Cartesian Sign Convention described above is illustrated inFig.9.9 for your reference. These sign conventions are applied to obtainthe mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.9.2.4  Mirror Formula and  MagnificationIn a spherical mirror, the distance of theobject from its pole is called the objectdistance (u).  The distance of the image fromthe pole of the mirror is called the image\ndistance (v). You already know that thedistance of the principal focus from the pole\nis called the focal length (f). There is arelationship between these three quantities\ngiven by the mirror formula which isexpressed as111vuf+=(9.1)This formula is valid in all situations for allspherical mirrors for all positions of theobject. You must use the New Cartesian SignConvention while substituting numericalvalues for u, v, f, and R in the mirror formulafor solving problems.MagnificationMagnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent towhich the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.It is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of theobject. It is usually represented by the letter m.If h is the height of the object and h′ is the height of the image, thenthe magnification m produced by a spherical mirror is given bym = Height of the image ()Height of the object ()′hhm = ′hh(9.2)The magnification m is also related to the object distance (u) andimage distance (v).  It can be expressed as:Magnification (m)  = ′=−hhvu(9.3)You may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive asthe object is usually placed above the principal axis.  The height of the\nimage should be taken as positive for virtual images.  However, it is to betaken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of themagnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the valueof the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9The New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrorsScience144Example 9.1A convex mirror used for rear-view on an automobile has a radius ofcurvature of 3.00 m.

Does it still move along a straight-line path or change itsdirection? We shall recall some of our day-to-day experiences.You might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pondcontaining water appears to be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slabis placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewedthrough the glass slab. Why does it happen? Have you seen a pencilpartly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? It appears to be displacedat the interface of air and water. You might have observed that a lemonkept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual\nsize, when viewed from the sides. How can you account for suchexperiences?Let us consider the case of the apparent displacement of a pencil,partly immersed in water. The light reaching you from the portion of thepencil inside water seems to come from a different direction, comparedto the part above water. This makes the pencil appear to be displaced atthe interface. For similar reasons, the letters appear to be raised, when\nseen through a glass slab placed over it.Does a pencil appear to be displaced to the same extent, if instead ofwater, we use liquids like kerosene or turpentine? Will the letters appearto rise to the same height if we replace a glass slab with a transparentplastic slab? You will find that the extent of the effect is different fordifferent pair of media. These observations indicate that light does notScience146travel in the same direction in all media. It appears that when travellingobliquely from one medium to another, the direction of propagation oflight in the second medium changes. This phenomenon is known as\nrefraction of light. Let us understand this phenomenon further by doinga few activities.Activity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7nPlace a coin at the bottom of a bucket filled with water.nWith your eye to a side above water, try to pick up the coin in onego.

Does the coin becomes\nvisible again from your position?  How could this happen?The coin becomes visible again on pouring water into the bowl. Thecoin appears slightly raised above its actual position due to refraction oflight.Activity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9nDraw a thick straight line in ink, over a sheet of white paper placedon a Table.nPlace a glass slab over the line in such a way that one of its edges\nmakes an angle with the line.nLook at the portion of the line under the slab from the sides.

Does the part of the line under the glass slabappear bent?nLook at the line from the top of the glass slab. Does the part of the\nline, beneath the slab, appear to be raised? Why does this happen?9.3.1 Refraction through a Rectangular Glass SlabTo understand the phenomenon of refraction of light through a glassslab, let us do an Activity.Light – Reflection and Refraction147In this Activity, you will note, the light ray has changed its directionat points O and O′. Note that both the points O and O′ lie on surfacesseparating two transparent media. Draw a perpendicular NN’ to AB at Oand another perpendicular MM′ to CD at O′. The light ray at point O hasentered from a rarer medium to a denser medium, that is, from air to\nglass. Note that the light ray has bent towards\nthe normal. At O′, the light ray has enteredfrom glass to air, that is, from a densermedium to a rarer medium.  The light here\nhas bent away from the normal. Compare theangle of incidence with the angle of refractionat both refracting surfaces AB and CD.In Fig. 9.10, a ray EO is obliquelyincident on surface AB, called incident ray.\nOO′ is the refracted ray and O′ H is theemergent ray. You may observe that theemergent ray is parallel to the direction of\nthe incident ray. Why does it happen so? The\nextent of bending of the ray of light at the\nopposite parallel faces AB (air-glass interface)and CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular\nglass slab is equal and opposite. This is whythe ray emerges parallel to the incident ray.However, the light ray is shifted sidewardslightly. What happens when a light ray is\nincident normally to the interface of two\nmedia? Try and find out.Now you are familiar with the refraction of light. Refraction is due tochange in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to\nanother.  Experiments show that refraction of light occurs according tocertain laws.Activity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10nFix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.nPlace a rectangular glass slab over the sheet in the middle.nDraw the outline of the slab with a pencil.

Let EF meet AB at O.  Similarly, join the positions of tipof the pins G and H and produce it up to the edge CD.  Let HGmeet CD at O′.nJoin O and O′.  Also produce EF up to P, as shown by a dotted linein Fig. 9.10.Figure 9.10Figure 9.10Figure 9.10Figure 9.10Figure 9.10Refraction of light through a rectangular glass slabScience148The following are the laws of refraction of light. (i)The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interfaceof two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in thesame plane.(ii)The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of\nrefraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and forthe given pair of media. This law is also known as Snell’s law ofrefraction. (This is true for angle 0 \u003c i \u003c 90o)If i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,sinsinir = constant(9.4)This constant value is called the refractive index of the second mediumwith respect to the first.  Let us study about refractive index in some detail.9.3.2 The Refractive IndexYou have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely fromone transparent medium into another will change its direction in thesecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).The refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,the relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1.  In air, the speed oflight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for agiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below.Consider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, asshown in Fig.9.11.  Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be thespeed of light in medium 2.  The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 andthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symboln21. This can be expressed in an equation form asn21=Speed of light in medium 1 Speed of light in medium 2=vv12(9.5)By the same argument, the refractive index of medium1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12. It is givenbyn12=Speed of light in medium 2 Speed of light in medium 1=vv21(9.6)If medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the refractive index of medium 2is considered with respect to vacuum.  This is called the absolute refractiveindex of the medium.  It is simply represented as n2. If c is the speed ofFigure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Light – Reflection and Refraction149The ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density.Optical density has a definite connotation.  It is not the same as mass density. We havebeen using the terms ‘rarer medium’ and ‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actuallymeans  ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When canwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, theone with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other.  The othermedium of lower refractive index is optically rarer.  The speed of light is higher in a rarermedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to adenser medium slows down and bends  towards the normal. When it travels from adenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.Note from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possessgreater mass density. For example, kerosene having higher refractiveindex, is optically denser than water, although its mass density is lessthan water.MaterialRefractiveMaterialRefractivemediumindexmediumindexAir1.0003Canada1.53BalsamIce1.31Water1.33Rock salt1.54Alcohol1.36Kerosene1.44Carbon1.63disulphideFused1.46quartzDense1.65flint glassTurpentine1.47oilRuby1.71Benzene1.50Sapphire1.77Crown1.52glassDiamond 2.42light in air and v is the speed of light in the medium, then, the refractiveindex of the medium nm is given bynm = Speed of light in air Speed of light in the medium =cv(9.7)The absolute refractive index of a medium is simply called its refractiveindex. The refractive index of several media is given in Table 9.3. From\nthe Table you can know that the refractive index of water, nw = 1.33.This means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed oflight in water is equal to 1.33.  Similarly, the refractive index of crownglass, ng =1.52. Such data are helpful in many places.  However, youneed not memorise the data.Table 9.3 Absolute refractive index of some material mediaMore to Know!Science1509.3.3 Refraction by Spherical LensesYou might have seen watchmakers using a small magnifying glass tosee tiny parts. Have you ever touched the surface of a magnifying glasswith your hand? Is it plane surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middleor at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmakerare examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? Weshall discuss these in this section.A transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or bothsurfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means\nthat a lens is bound by at least one sphericalsurface. In such lenses, the other surface wouldbe plane.  A lens may have two sphericalsurfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is calleda double convex lens. It is simply called a convexlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared tothe edges. Convex lens converges light rays asshown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses arealso called converging lenses.  Similarly, a doubleconcave lens is bounded by two sphericalsurfaces, curved inwards.  It is thicker at theedges than at the middle. Such lenses divergelight rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lensesare also called diverging lenses. A double concavelens is simply called a concave lens.A lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,has two spherical surfaces. Each of these surfacesforms a part of a sphere. The centres of thesespheres are called centres of curvature of the lens.The centre of curvature of a lens is usuallyrepresented by the letter C.  Since there are twocentres of curvature, we may represent them as C1 and C2. An imaginarystraight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens iscalled its principal axis. The central point of a lens is its optical centre. It isQUESTIONS?1.A ray of light travelling in air enters obliquely into water. Does the lightray bend towards the normal or away from the normal?

In which of these doesthe light travel fastest? Use the information given in Table 9.3.5.The refractive index of diamond is 2.42. What is the meaning of this\nstatement?(a)Figure 9.12Figure 9.12Figure 9.12Figure 9.12Figure 9.12(a) Converging action of a convex lens, (b) diverging\naction of a concave lens(b)Light – Reflection and Refraction151usually represented by the letter O. A ray of light through the opticalcentre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. The effectivediameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.We shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whoseaperture is much less than its radius of curvature and the two centres ofcurvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses arecalled thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel raysof light are incident on a lens?  Let us do an Activity to understand this.Activity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11CAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or through a lens whiledoing this Activity or otherwise. You may damage your eyes if youdo so.nHold a convex lens in your hand. Direct it towards the Sun.nFocus the light from the Sun on a sheet of paper. Obtain a sharpbright image of the Sun.nHold the paper and the lens in the same position for a while.  Keepobserving the paper. What happened? Why? Recall your experiencein Activity 9.2.The paper begins to burn producing smoke. It may even catch fireafter a while.  Why does this happen? The light from the Sun constitutesparallel rays of light.  These rays were converged by the lens at the sharpbright spot formed on the paper.  In fact, the bright spot you got on thepaper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a\npoint generated heat.  This caused the paper to burn.Now, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of alens.  What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?This is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lensin Fig.9.12 (b).Observe Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to theprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refractionfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This pointon the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us seenow the action of a concave lens.Observe Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to theprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refractionfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principalaxis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of theconcave lens.If you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, youget another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually usedto represent principal focus. However, a lens has two principal foci.  Theyare represented by F1 and F2. The distance of the principal focus fromthe optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f  is used torepresent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex\nlens? Recall the Activity 9.11. In this Activity, the distance between theposition of the lens and the position of the image of the Sun gives theapproximate focal length of the lens.Science1529.3.4 Image Formation by LensesLenses form images by refracting light. How do lenses form images?What is their nature? Let us study this for a convex lens first.Activity 9.12Activity 9.12Activity 9.12Activity 9.12Activity 9.12nTake a convex lens.  Find its approximate focal length in a waydescribed in Activity 9.11.nDraw five parallel straight lines, using chalk, on a long Table such\nthat the distance between the successive lines is equal to the\nfocal length of the lens.nPlace the lens on a lens stand.

Note down and tabulate yourobservations.The nature, position and relative size of the image formed by convexlens for various positions of the object is summarised in Table 9.4.Let us now do an Activity to study the nature, position and relativesize of the image formed by a concave lens.Table 9.4Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a convex lens for variouspositions of the objectPosition of thePosition ofRelative size ofNature ofobjectthe image the imagethe imageAt infinityAt focus F2Highly diminished,Real and invertedpoint-sizedBeyond 2F1Between F2  and 2F2DiminishedReal and invertedAt 2F1At 2F2Same sizeReal and invertedBetween F1 and 2F1Beyond 2F2EnlargedReal and invertedAt focus F1At infinityInfinitely large orReal and invertedhighly enlargedBetween focus F1On the same sideEnlargedVirtual and erectandof the lens as theoptical centre OobjectLight – Reflection and Refraction153The summary of the above Activity is given in Table 9.5 below.Activity 9.13Activity 9.13Activity 9.13Activity 9.13Activity 9.13nTake a concave lens.

Note the change in the size\nof the image. What happens to the size of the image when thecandle is placed too far away from the lens.What conclusion can you draw from this Activity? A concave lenswill always give a virtual, erect and diminished image, irrespective of theposition of the object.9.3.5 Image Formation in Lenses Using Ray Diagrams We can represent image formation by lenses using ray diagrams. Raydiagrams will also help us to study the nature, position and relative sizeof the image formed by lenses. For drawing ray diagrams in lenses, alikeof spherical mirrors, we consider any two of the following rays –(i)A ray of light from the object, parallel to the principal axis, after\nrefraction from a convex lens, passes through the principal focuson the other side of the lens, as shown in Fig. 9.13 (a). In case ofa concave lens,the ray appearsto diverge fromthe principalfocus locatedon the sameside of the lens,as shown inFig. 9.13 (b).(a)(b)Table 9.5 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a concave lens for variouspositions of the objectPosition of thePosition ofRelative size ofNature ofobjectthe image the imagethe imageAt infinityAt focus F1Highly diminished,Virtual and erectpoint-sizedBetween infinity andBetween focus F1DiminishedVirtual and erectoptical centre Oand optical centre Oof the lensFigure 9.13Figure 9.13Figure 9.13Figure 9.13Figure 9.13Science154(ii)A ray of light passingthrough a principalfocus, after refractionfrom a convex lens, willemerge parallel to theprincipal axis.

The ray diagramsrepresenting the image formation in a concave lens for various positionsof the object are shown in Fig. 9.17.Figure 9.14Figure 9.14Figure 9.14Figure 9.14Figure 9.14Figure 9.15Figure 9.15Figure 9.15Figure 9.15Figure 9.15Light – Reflection and Refraction155Figure 9.16Figure 9.16Figure 9.16Figure 9.16Figure 9.16 The position, size and the nature of the image formed bya convex lens for various positions of the objectFigure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a concave lens9.3.6 Sign Convention for Spherical LensesFor lenses, we follow sign convention, similar to the one used for sphericalmirrors. We apply the rules for signs of distances, except that allmeasurements are taken from the optical centre of the lens. According\nto the convention, the focal length of a convex lens is positive and that of\na concave lens is negative. You must take care to apply appropriatesigns for the values of u, v, f, object height h and image height h′.9.3.7 Lens Formula and MagnificationAs we have a formula for spherical mirrors, we also have formula forspherical lenses. This formula gives the relationship between object-distance (u), image-distance (v) and the focal length (f).  The lens formulais expressed as111vuf−=(9.8)The lens formula given above is general and is valid in all situationsfor any spherical lens. Take proper care of the signs of different quantities,while putting numerical values for solving problems relating to lenses.Science156MagnificationThe magnification produced by a lens, similar to that for sphericalmirrors, is defined as the ratio of the height of the image and the height\nof the object. Magnification is represented by the letter m. If h is theheight of the object and h′ is the height of the image given by a lens, thenthe magnification produced by the lens is given by,m = Height of the ImageHeight of the object=hh′(9.9)Magnification produced by a lens is also related to the object−distanceu, and the image-distance v. This relationship is given byMagnification (m ) = h′/h = v/u(9.10)Example 9.3A concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance shouldthe object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm\nfrom the lens? Also, find the magnification produced by the lens.SolutionA concave lens always forms a virtual, erect image on the same side\nof the object.Image-distance v=–10 cm;Focal length f=–15 cm;Object-distance u=?Since 111vuf−=or,111–uvf=()11111–––10–151015u==+13213030u−+==−or, u = – 30 cmThus, the object-distance is 30 cm.Magnification m = v/um = −−=+10cm30cm130.33;The positive sign shows that the image is erect and virtual. The imageis one-third of the size of the object.Example 9.4\nA 2.0 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a\nconvex lens of focal length 10 cm. The distance of the object from thelens is 15 cm. Find the nature, position and size of the image. Alsofind its magnification.Light – Reflection and Refraction157SolutionHeight of the object h=+ 2.0 cm;Focal length f=+ 10 cm;object-distance u=–15 cm;Image-distance v=?Height of the image h′=?Since111vuf−=or,111vuf=+11111(15)101510v=+=−+−12313030v−+==or,v = + 30 cmThe positive sign of v shows that the image is formed at a distance of30 cm on the other side of the optical centre.  The image is real andinverted.Magnification m = 'hvhu=or,h′ = h (v/u)Height of the image, h′ = (2.0) (+30/–15) = – 4.0 cmMagnification m =  v/uor, 30cm215cmm+==−−The negative signs of m and h′ show that the image is inverted andreal. It is formed below the principal axis. Thus, a real, inverted image,4 cm tall, is formed at a distance of 30 cm on the other side of thelens. The image is two times enlarged.9.3.8 Power of a LensYou have already learnt that the ability of a lens to converge or divergelight rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens ofshort focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussingthem closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very shortfocal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal\nlength. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved\nby a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power of a lens is definedas the reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented by the letter P.  Thepower P of a lens of focal length f is given byP = 1f(9.11)Science158The SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’. It is denoted by the letter D.If f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus,1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m–1.You may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of aconcave lens is negative.Opticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers.  Let ussay the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D.  This means the lensprescribed is convex.  The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,a lens of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of – 0.40 m.  The lens is concave.Many optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase\nthe magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power (P) of the lenses placedin contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1, P2, P3, …   asP = P1 + P2 + P3 + …The use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians.\nDuring eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lensesof known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. The optician calculatesthe power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination\nof two lenses of power  + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D.The simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systemsto minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens.  Such a lens system,consisting of several lenses, in contact, is commonly used in the design of lenses ofcamera, microscopes and telescopes.QUESTIONS?1.Define 1 dioptre of power of a lens.2.A convex lens forms a real and inverted image of a needle at a distanceof 50 cm from it.

    "input": "The Human Eye andthe Colourful World10CHAPTERYou have studied in the previous chapter about refraction of light bylenses. You also studied the nature, position and relative size ofimages formed by lenses. How can these ideas help us in the study ofthe human eye? The human eye uses light and enables us to see objects\naround us. It has a lens in its structure.  What is the function of the lensin a human eye? How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects ofvision? Let us consider these questions in this chapter.We have learnt in the previous chapter about light and some of itsproperties. In this chapter, we shall use these ideas to study some of theoptical phenomena in nature. We shall also discuss about rainbowformation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.10.1 THE HUMAN EYEThe human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs.It enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On\nclosing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,taste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identifycolours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the humaneye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,colourful world around us.The human eye is like a camera.  Its lenssystem forms an image on a light-sensitive\nscreen called the retina. Light enters the eyethrough a thin membrane called the cornea.\nIt forms the transparent bulge on the frontsurface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1.The eyeball is approximately spherical in shape\nwith a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of therefraction for the light rays entering the eyeoccurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The\ncrystalline lens merely provides the fineradjustment of focal length required to focusobjects at different distances on the retina. We find a structure called irisbehind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls thesize of the pupil.  The pupil regulates and controls the amount of lightFigure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1The human eyeScience162entering the eye. The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the objecton the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous\nnumber of light-sensitive cells.  The light-sensitive cells get activatedupon illumination and generate electrical signals.  These signals aresent to the brain via the optic nerves.  The brain interprets these signals,\nand finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects asthey are.10.1.1 Power of AccommodationThe eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvaturecan be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the\ncurvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When themuscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal lengthincreases.  This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are\nlooking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This\nincreases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker.Consequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases.  This enables\nus to see nearby objects clearly.The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is calledaccommodation.  However, the focal length of the eye lens cannot bedecreased below a certain minimum limit.  Try to read a printed page byholding it very close to your eyes. You may see the image being blurredor feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you\nmust hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes.  The minimum distance, atwhich objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called theleast distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye.\nFor a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about\n25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly iscalled the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a normal eye. You may notehere a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm andinfinity.Sometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky andcloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete\nloss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTIONSometimes, the eye may gradually lose its power of accommodation.In such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and\ncomfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defectsof the eye.There are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. Theseare (i) myopia or near-sightedness, (ii) Hypermetropia or far-sightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia.  These defects can be corrected by\nthe use of suitable spherical lenses. We discuss below these defectsand their correction.The Human Eye and the Colourful World163(a)MyopiaMyopia is also known as near-sightedness. A person with myopia\ncan see nearby objects clearly butcannot see distant objects distinctly.A person with this defect has the farpoint nearer than infinity. Such aperson may see clearly upto adistance of a few metres. In a myopiceye, the image of a distant object isformed in front of the retina [Fig.10.2 (b)] and not at the retina itself.This defect may arise due to (i)excessive curvature of the eye lens,or (ii) elongation of the eyeball. Thisdefect can be corrected by using aconcave lens of suitable power. Thisis illustrated in Fig. 10.2 (c). A\nconcave lens of suitable power willbring the image back on to theretina and thus the defect is corrected.(b)HypermetropiaHypermetropia is also known as far-sightedness.A person with hypermetropia can see distantobjects clearly but cannot see nearby objectsdistinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther\naway from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a\nperson has to keep a reading material much\nbeyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable\nreading. This is because the light rays from a\ncloseby object are focussed at a point behind the\nretina as shown in Fig. 10.3 (b). This defect arises\neither because (i) the focal length of the eye lens is\ntoo long, or (ii) the eyeball has become too small.\nThis defect can be corrected by using a convex\nlens of appropriate power. This is illustrated inFig. 10.3 (c). Eye-glasses with converging lensesprovide the additional focussing power requiredfor forming the image on the retina.(c)   PresbyopiaThe power of accommodation of the eye usually\ndecreases with ageing. For most people, the near\npoint gradually recedes away. They find it difficult\nto see nearby objects comfortably and distinctly\nwithout corrective eye-glasses.  This defect iscalled Presbyopia.  It arises due to the gradualFigure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2Figure 10.2(a), (b) The myopic eye, and (c) correction for myopia with a\nconcave lensFigure 10.3Figure 10.3Figure 10.3Figure 10.3Figure 10.3\n(a), (b) The hypermetropic eye, and (c)\ncorrection for hypermetropiaN = Near point of a      hypermetropic eye.N’ = Near point of a      normal eye.Science164Think it overYou talk of wondrous things you see,You say the sun shines bright;I feel him warm, but how can heOr make it day or night? – C. CIBBERDo you know that our eyes can live even after our death? By donating our eyes after wedie, we can light the life of a blind person.About 35 million people in the developing world are blind and most of them can becured. About 4.5 million people with corneal blindness can be cured through cornealtransplantation of donated eyes. Out of these 4.5 million, 60% are children below theage of 12. So, if we have got the gift of vision, why not pass it on to somebody who doesnot have it? What do we have to keep in mind when eyes have to be donated?nEye donors can belong to any age group or sex. People who use spectacles, or thoseoperated for cataract, can still donate the eyes. People who are diabetic, havehypertension, asthma patients and those without communicable diseases can also\ndonate eyes.weakening of the ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of theeye lens.  Sometimes, a person may suffer from both myopia and\nhypermetropia.  Such people often require bi-focal lenses. A common\ntype of bi-focal lenses consists of both concave and convex lenses.\nThe upper portion consists of a concave lens. It facilitates distantvision. The lower part is a convex lens.  It facilitates near vision.  These days, it is possible to correct the refractive defects withcontact lenses or through surgical interventions.QUESTIONS?1.What is meant by power of accommodation of the eye?2.A person with a myopic eye cannot see objects beyond 1.2 m distinctly.What should be the type of the corrective lens used to restore propervision?3.What is the far point and near point of the human eye with normal\nvision?4.A student has difficulty reading the blackboard while sitting in the lastrow.

For parallel refracting surfaces, as in a glass slab, the emergent rayis parallel to the incident ray.  However, it is slightly displaced laterally.How would light get refracted through a transparent prism? Consider a\ntriangular glass prism. It has two triangular bases and three rectangular\nlateral surfaces. These surfaces are inclined to each other. The anglebetween its two lateral faces is called the angle of the prism. Let us now\ndo an activity to study the refraction of light through a triangular glass\nprism.nEyes must be removed within 4-6 hours after death. Inform the nearest eye bankimmediately.nThe eye bank team will remove the eyes at the home of the deceased or at a hospital.nEye removal takes only 10-15 minutes. It is a simple process and does not lead toany disfigurement.nPersons who were infected with or died because of AIDS, Hepatitis B or C, rabies,\nacute leukaemia, tetanus, cholera, meningitis or encephalitis cannot donate eyes.An eye bank collects, evaluates and distributes the donated eyes. All eyes donated areevaluated using strict medical standards. Those donated eyes found unsuitable fortransplantation are used for valuable research and medical education. The identitiesof both the donor and the recipient remain confidential.One pair of eyes gives vision to up to FOUR CORNEAL BLIND PEOPLE.Activity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1nFix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.nPlace a glass prism on it in such a way that it rests on its triangularbase. Trace the outline of the prism using a pencil.nDraw a straight line PE inclined to one of the refracting surfaces,\nsay AB, of the prism.nFix two pins, say at points P and Q, on the line PE as shown in\nFig. 10.4.nLook for the images of the pins, fixed at P and Q, through the\nother face AC.nFix two more pins, at points R and S, such that the pins at R and\nS and the images of the pins at P and Q lie on the same straightline.nRemove the pins and the glass prism.nThe line PE meets the boundary of the prism at point E(see Fig. 10.4). Similarly, join and produce the points R and S.  Letthese lines meet the boundary of the prism at E and F, respectively.Join E and F.nDraw perpendiculars to the refracting surfaces AB and AC of theprism at points E and F, respectively.nMark the angle of incidence (∠i), the angle of refraction (∠r) andthe angle of emergence (∠e) as shown in Fig. 10.4.Science166Activity 10.2Activity 10.2Activity 10.2Activity 10.2Activity 10.2nTake a thick sheet of cardboard and make a small hole or narrowslit in its middle.nAllow sunlight to fall on the narrow slit. This gives a narrow beam\nof white light.nNow, take a glass prism and allow the light from the slit to fall on\none of its faces as shown in Fig. 10.5.nTurn the prism slowly until the light that comes out of it appears\non a nearby screen.nWhat do you observe? You will find a beautiful band of colours.Why does this happen?Here PE is the incident ray, EF is the refracted ray and FS is theemergent ray. You may note that a ray of light is entering from air toglass at the first surface AB. The light ray on refraction has bent towardsthe normal. At the second surface AC, the light ray has entered fromglass to air. Hence it has bent away from normal. Compare the angle ofincidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the\nprism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab?The peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at anangle to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is called the angle ofdeviation. In this case ∠D is the angle of deviation. Mark the angle ofdeviation in the above activity and measure it.10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GLASS PRISMASS PRISMASS PRISMASS PRISMASS PRISMYou must have seen and appreciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow.How could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of therainbow? Before we take up this question, we shall first go back to therefraction of light through a prism. The inclined refracting surfaces of aglass prism show exciting phenomenon.  Let us find it out through anactivity.PE – Incident ray∠i – Angle of incidenceEF – Refracted ray∠r – Angle of refractionFS – Emergent ray∠e – Angle of emergence∠A – Angle of the prism∠D – Angle of deviationFigure 10.4Figure 10.4Figure 10.4Figure 10.4Figure 10.4 Refraction of light through a triangular glass prismThe Human Eye and the Colourful World167The prism has probably split the incidentwhite light into a band of colours.  Note thecolours that appear at the two ends of the\ncolour band. What is the sequence of colours\nthat you see on the screen? The variouscolours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,Yellow, Orange and Red, as shown inFig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help\nyou to remember the sequence of colours.The band of the coloured components of alight beam is called its spectrum. You mightnot be able to see all the colours separately.\nYet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splittingof light into its component colours is called dispersion.You have seen that white light is dispersedinto its seven-colour components by a prism.Why do we get these colours? Different coloursof light bend through different angles withrespect to the incident ray, as they pass\nthrough a prism. The red light bends the least\nwhile the violet the most. Thus the rays of eachcolour emerge along different paths and thusbecome distinct. It is the band of distinct\ncolours that we see in a spectrum.Isaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtainthe spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours ofthe spectrum of white light further by using another similarprism. However, he could not get any more colours. Hethen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position\nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. Thisallowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass throughthe second prism. He found a beam of white light emergingfrom the other side of the second prism. This observationgave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of sevencolours.Any light that gives a spectrum similar to that ofsunlight is often referred to as white light.A rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the skyafter a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersionof sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in theatmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a directionopposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act likesmall prisms. They refract and disperse the incidentsunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract itagain when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Dueto the dispersion of light and internal reflection, differentcolours reach the observer’s eye.You can also see a rainbow on a sunny day whenyou look at the sky through a waterfall or through a waterfountain, with the Sun behind you.Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prismFigure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum ofwhite lightFigure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Rainbow in the skyFigure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Rainbow formationSunlightRaindropScience168Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Atmospheric refraction\neffects at sunrise and\nsunset10.5     ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTIONYou might have observed the apparent random wavering orflickering of objects seen through a turbulent stream of hot airrising above a fire or a radiator. The air just above the fire becomeshotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)\nthan the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightlyless than that of the cooler air. Since the physical conditions ofthe refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparentposition of the object, as seen through the hot air, fluctuates.This wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction\nof light by the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our localenvironment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon ona much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.Twinkling of stars\nThe twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. Thestarlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refractioncontinuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refractionoccurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since theatmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent positionof the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appearsslightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near thehorizon (Fig. 10.9). Further, this apparent position of the star is notstationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions\nof the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the\nprevious paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximatepoint-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming fromthe star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the starfluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers – thestar sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, whichis the twinkling effect.Why don’t the planets twinkle? The planets are muchcloser to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources.\nIf we consider a planet as a collection of a large numberof point-sized sources of light, the total variation in theamount of light entering our eye from all the individualpoint-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby\nnullifying the twinkling effect.Advance sunrise and delayed sunsetThe Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actualsunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunsetbecause of atmospheric refraction. By actual sunrise, wemean the actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions of theSun with respect to the horizon. The time differencebetween actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun’s disc at\nsunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon.Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Apparent star position\ndue to atmospheric\nrefractionThe Human Eye and the Colourful World16910.6  SCATTERING OF LIGHTThe interplay of light with objects around us gives rise to severalspectacular phenomena in nature. The blue colour of the sky, colour ofwater in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset\nare some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous\nclass, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles.\nThe path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible.\nHowever, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where thesize of the particles is relatively larger.10.6.1 Tyndall EffectThe earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles.\nThese particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particlesof dust and molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes such fineparticles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,after being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of\nscattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect\nwhich you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a\nfine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.Thus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect canalso be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense\nforest.  Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.The colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scatteringparticles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles oflarger size scatter light of longer wavelengths.  If the size of the scatteringparticles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appearwhite.10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have sizesmaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in\nscattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer\nwavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8times greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through theatmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter\nwavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters\nour eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been\nany scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark.  The sky appears\ndark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is notprominent at such heights.You might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights are red in colour.Do you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke.  Therefore,it can be seen in the same colour at a distance.Science170What you have learntnThe ability of the eye to focus on both near and distant objects, by adjusting itsfocal length, is called the accommodation of the eye.nThe smallest distance, at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain, is\ncalled the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision.  For a youngadult with normal vision, it is about 25 cm.nThe common refractive defects of vision include myopia, hypermetropia and\npresbyopia. Myopia (short-sightedness – the image of distant objects is focussedbefore the retina) is corrected by using a concave lens of suitable power.Hypermetropia (far-sightedness – the image of nearby objects is focussed beyondthe retina) is corrected by using a convex lens of suitable power. The eye loses itspower of accommodation at old age.nThe splitting of white light into its component colours is called dispersion.nScattering of light causes the blue colour of sky.EXERCISES1.The human eye can focus on objects at different distances by adjusting the focallength of the eye lens.

It is a controllableand convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools,hospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How doesit flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulatethe current through an electric circuit? In this Chapter, we shall attemptto answer such questions. We shall also discuss the heating effect ofelectric current and its applications.11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUITWe are familiar with air current and water current. We know that flowingwater constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric chargeflows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), wesay that there is an electric current in the conductor. In a torch, weknow that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide\nflow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow. Wehave also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. Whatdoes a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell andthe bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called anelectric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of thetorch is turned off), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.How do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed bythe amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. Inother words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using\nmetallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electronswere not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first\nobserved. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positivecharges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be thedirection of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit thedirection of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of theflow of electrons, which are negative charges.Science172If a net charge Q, flows across any cross-section of a conductor intime t, then the current I, through the cross-section isIQt=(11.1)The SI unit of electρic chaρge is couloµb (C), which is equivalent tothe chaρge contained in neaρly 6 × 1018 electrons. (We know that anelectron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 × 10–19 C.) The electriccurrent is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after theFrench scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775–1836). One ampere is\nconstituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is,\n1 A = 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are expressed in milliampere(1 mA = 10–3 A) or in microampere (1 µA = 10–6 A).An instrument called ammeter measures electric\ncurrent in a circuit. It is always connected in series\nin a circuit through which the current is to be\nmeasured. Figure 11.1 shows the schematic\ndiagram of a typical electric circuit comprising a\ncell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug key.\nNote that the electric current flows in the circuit\nfrom the positive terminal of the cell to the negativeterminal of the cell through the bulb and ammeter.Figure 11.1Figure 11.1Figure 11.1Figure 11.1Figure 11.1A schematic diagram of an electric circuit\ncomprising – cell, electric bulb, ammeter and\nplug keyQUESTIONS?Example 11.1A current of 0.5 A is drawn by a filament of an electric bulb for 10minutes. Find the amount of electric charge that flows through thecircuit.SolutionWe are given, I = 0.5 A; t = 10 min = 600 s.From Eq. (11.1), we haveQ=It=0.5 A × 600 s=300 C1.What does an electric circuit mean?2.Define the unit of current.3.Calculate the number of electrons constituting one coulomb of charge.Electricity17311.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCEWhat makes the electric charge to flow? Let us consider the analogy offlow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just aswater in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tubeis connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a\npressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of\nthe other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic\nwire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only\nif there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential difference –along the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by abattery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within\na cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,\neven when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a\nconducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges inmotion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order tomaintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its\nchemical energy stored in it.We define the electric potential difference between two points in anelectric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit\ncharge from one point to the other –Potential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q)V=W/Q(11.2)The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named afterAlessandro Volta (1745–1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is thepotential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor\nwhen 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from onepoint to the other.Therefore, 1 volt = 1 joule1 coulomb(11.3)1 V  = 1 J C–1The potential difference is measured by means of an instrument calledthe voltmeter. The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across thepoints between which the potential difference is to be measured.Example 11.2How much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two pointshaving a potential difference 12 V?SolutionThe amount of charge Q, that flows between two points at potentialdifference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W, done inmoving the charge [from Eq. (11.2)] isScience174W=VQ=12 V × 2 C=24 J.QUESTIONS?11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAMWe know that an electric circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.1, comprises a cell(or a battery), a plug key, electrical component(s), and connecting wires.It is often convenient to draw a schematic diagram, in which differentcomponents of the circuit are represented by the symbols conveniently\nused.

Let us explore with an Activity.Activity 11.1Activity 11.1Activity 11.1Activity 11.1Activity 11.1nSet up a circuit as shown in Fig. 11.2,consisting of a nichrome wire XY of length,say 0.5 m, an ammeter, a voltmeter andfour cells of 1.5 V each. (Nichrome is an\nalloy of nickel, chromium, manganese, andiron metals.)nFirst use only one cell as the source in the\ncircuit. Note the reading in the ammeter I,for the current and reading of the voltmeter\nV for the potential difference across thenichrome wire XY in the circuit. Tabulate\nthem in the Table given.nNext connect two cells in the circuit and\nnote the respective readings of the ammeter and voltmeter for the values of current throughthe nichrome wire and potential difference across the nichrome wire.nRepeat the above steps using three cells and then four cells in the circuit separately.nCalculate the ratio of V to I for each pair of potential difference V and current I.S.Number of cellsCurrent throughPotential differenceV/INo.used in thethe nichromeacross the(volt/ampere)circuitwire, Inichrome(ampere)wire, V (volt)11223344nPlot a graph between V and I, and observe the nature of the graph.7Electric bulb or    8A resistor of resistance R9Variable resistance or rheostat or 10Ammeter11VoltmeterFigure 11.2Figure 11.2Figure 11.2Figure 11.2Figure 11.2 Electric circuit for studying Ohm’s lawScience176Figure 11.3Figure 11.3Figure 11.3Figure 11.3Figure 11.3V–I graph for a nichrome wire. A\nstraight line plot shows that as the\ncurrent through a wire increases, the\npotential difference across the wire\nincreases linearly – this is Ohm’s law.Activity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2nTake a nichrome wire, a torch bulb, a 10 W bulb and an ammeter (0 – 5 A range), a plugkey and some connecting wires.nSet up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 1.5 V each in series with the ammeter\nleaving a gap XY in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.4.In this Activity, you will find that approximately thesame value for V/I is obtained in each case. Thus the V–Igraph is a straight line that passes through the origin ofthe graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, V/I is a constantratio.In 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm(1787–1854) found out the relationship between the current\nI, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential differenceacross its terminals. The potential difference, V, across theends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly\nproportional to the current flowing through it,  provided its\ntemperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In\nother words –V ∝ I(11.4)orV/I=constant=RorV=IR(11.5)In Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wireat a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is theproperty of a conductor to resist the flow of charges  through it. Its SIunit is ohm, represented by the Greek letter Ω. According to Ohm’s law,R = V/I(11.6)If the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 Vand the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductoris 1 Ω. That is, 1 ohm = 1 volt1 ampereAlso from Eq. (11.5) we getI = V/R(11.7)It is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor isinversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled thecurrent gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase\nor decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to\nregulate current without changing the voltage source is called variableresistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used tochange the resistance in the circuit. We will now study about electricalresistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity.Electricity177In this Activity we observe that the current is different for differentcomponents. Why do they differ? Certain components offer an easy pathfor the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. We knowthat motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric\ncurrent. The electrons, however, are not completely free to move within aconductor. They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms amongwhich they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is\nretarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low\nresistance is a good conductor. A conductor having some appreciableresistance is called a resistor. A component of identical size that offers ahigher resistance is a poor conductor. An insulator of the same size offerseven higher resistance.11.5 FA11.5 FA11.5 FA11.5 FA11.5 FACTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF ACONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSFigure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4nComplete the circuit by connecting the nichrome wire in the gap XY.

[Note: Always take out the keyfrom the plug after measuring the current through the circuit.]nReplace the nichrome wire with the torch bulb in the circuit and find the current throughit by measuring the reading of the ammeter.nNow repeat the above step with the 10 W bulb in the gap XY.nAre the ammeter readings different for different components connected in the gap XY?\nWhat do the above observations indicate?nYou may repeat this Activity by keeping any material component in the gap. Observe theammeter readings in each case. Analyse the observations.Activity 11.3Activity 11.3Activity 11.3Activity 11.3Activity 11.3nComplete an electric circuit consisting of a cell, an ammeter, a nichrome wire of length l[say, marked (1)] and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.5.Science178It is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to one-half whenthe length of the wire is doubled. The ammeter reading is increased whena thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in thecircuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of differentmaterial of the same length and the same area of cross-section is used.On applying Ohm’s law [Eqs. (11.5) – (11.7)], we observe that theresistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area ofcross-section, and (iii) on the nature of its material. Precise measurementshave shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directlyproportional to its length (l) and inversely proportional to the area ofcross-section (A). That is,R ∝ l(11.8)andR ∝ 1/A(11.9)Combining Eqs. (11.8) and (11.9) we getR ∝ lAor,R = ρlA(11.10)where ρ (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electricalresistivity of the material of the conductor. The SI unit of resistivity isΩ m. It is a characteristic property of the material.

Athicker wire has a larger cross-sectional area. Again note down the current through the\ncircuit.nInstead of taking a nichrome wire, connect a copper wire [marked (4) in Fig. 11.5] in the\ncircuit. Let the wire be of the same length and same area of cross-section as that of thefirst nichrome wire [marked (1)]. Note the value of the current.nNotice the difference in the current in all cases.nDoes the current depend on the length of the conductor?nDoes the current depend on the area of cross-section of the wire used?Electricity179have very low resistivity in the  range of 10–8 Ω m to  10–6 Ω m. They aregood conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass haveresistivity of the order of 1012 to 1017 Ω m. Both the resistance andresistivity of a material vary with temperature.Table 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higherthan that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily\nat high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used inelectrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used\nalmost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and\naluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.Table 11.2 Electrical resistivity* of some substances at 20°CMaterialResistivity (ΩΩΩΩΩ m)ConductorsSilver1.60 × 10–8Copper1.62 × 10–8Aluminium2.63 × 10–8Tungsten5.20 × 10–8Nickel6.84 × 10–8Iron10.0 × 10–8Chromium12.9 × 10–8Mercury94.0 × 10–8Manganese1.84 × 10–6AlloysConstantan49 × 10–6(alloy of Cu and Ni)Manganin44 × 10–6(alloy of Cu, Mn and Ni)\nNichrome100 × 10–6(alloy of Ni, Cr, Mn and Fe)InsulatorsGlass1010 – 1014Hard rubber1013 – 1016Ebonite1015 – 1017Diamond1012 - 1013Paper (dry)1012* You need not memorise these values.

(b) How muchcurrent will an electric heater coil draw from a 220 V source, if\nthe resistance of the heater coil is 100 Ω?Solution\n(a)We are given V = 220 V; R = 1200 Ω.From Eq.

If thediameter of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of themetal at that temperature? Using Table 11.2, predict the materialof the wire.SolutionWe are given the resistance R of the wire = 26 Ω, the diameterd = 0.3 mm = 3 × 10-4 m, and the length l of the wire = 1 m.Therefore, from Eq. (11.10), the resistivity of the given metallic wire isρ=  (RA/l)  =  (Rπd2/4l)Substitution of values in this givesρ=  1.84 × 10–6 Ω mThe resistivity of the metal at 20°C is 1.84 × 10–6 Ω m. FromTable 11.2, we see that this is the resistivity of manganese.Example 11.6A wire of given material having length l and area of cross-section Ahas a resistance of 4 Ω.

Wehave noticed how the current through a conductor depends upon itsresistance and the potential difference across its ends. In various electricalgadgets, we often use resistors in various combinations. We now thereforeintend to see how Ohm’s law can be applied to combinations of resistors.There are two methods of joining the resistors together. Figure 11.6shows an electric circuit in which three resistors having resistances R1,R2 and R3, respectively, are joined end to end. Here the resistors are saidto be connected in series.Figure 11.6Figure 11.6Figure 11.6Figure 11.6Figure 11.6 Resistors in seriesScience182Figure 11.7Figure 11.7Figure 11.7Figure 11.7Figure 11.7 Resistors in parallelYou will observe that the value of the current in the ammeter is thesame, independent of its position in the electric circuit. It means that ina series combination of resistors the current is the same in every part ofthe circuit or the same current through each resistor.Activity 11.4Activity 11.4Activity 11.4Activity 11.4Activity 11.4nJoin three resistors of different values in series. Connect themwith a battery, an ammeter and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.6.You may use the resistors of values like 1 Ω, 2 Ω, 3 Ω etc., and abattery of 6 V for performing this Activity.nPlug the key. Note the ammeter reading.nChange the position of ammeter to anywhere in between theresistors. Note the ammeter reading each time.nDo you find any change in the value of current through theammeter?11.6.1 Resistors in SeriesWhat happens to the value of current when a number of resistors areconnected in series in a circuit? What would be their equivalentresistance? Let us try to understand these with the help of the followingactivities.Figure 11.7 shows a combination of resistors in which three resistorsare connected together between points X and Y. Here, the resistors aresaid to be connected in parallel.Electricity183Activity 11.5Activity 11.5Activity 11.5Activity 11.5Activity 11.5nIn Activity 11.4, insert a voltmeter across the ends X and Y of theseries combination of three resistors, as shown in Fig. 11.6.nPlug the key in the circuit and note the voltmeter reading. It\ngives the potential difference across the series combination ofresistors. Let it be V. Now measure the potential difference acrossthe two terminals of the battery. Compare the two values.nTake out the plug key and disconnect the voltmeter. Now insertthe voltmeter across the ends X and P of the first resistor, asshown in Fig. 11.8.Figure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8nPlug the key and measure the potential difference across the first\nresistor. Let it be V1.nSimilarly, measure the potential difference across the other two\nresistors, separately. Let these values be V2 and V3, respectively.nDeduce a relationship between V, V1, V2 and V3.You will observe that the potential difference V is equal to the sum ofpotential differences V1, V2, and V3. That is the total potential differenceacross a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potentialdifference across the individual resistors. That is,V = V1 + V2  + V3(11.11)In the electric circuit shown in Fig. 11.8, let I be the current throughthe circuit. The current through each resistor is also I. It is possible toreplace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent single resistorof resistance R, such that the potential difference V across it, and thecurrent I through the circuit remains the same. Applying the Ohm’s lawto the entire circuit, we haveV = I R(11.12)Science184On applying Ohm’s law to the three resistors separately, we furtherhaveV1=I R1[11.13(a)]V2=I R2[11.13(b)]andV3=I R3[11.13(c)]From Eq. (11.11),I R= I R1 + I R2 + I R3orRs= R1 +R2 + R3(11.14)We can conclude that when several resistors are joined in series, theresistance of the combination Rs equals the sum of their individualresistances, R1, R2, R3, and is thus greater than any individual resistance.Example 11.7An electric lamp, whose resistance is 20 Ω, and a conductor of 4 Ωresistance are connected to a 6 V battery (Fig. 11.9). Calculate (a) the\ntotal resistance of the circuit, (b) the current through the circuit, and (c)the potential difference across the electric lamp and conductor.Solution\nThe resistance of electric lamp, R1 = 20 Ω,The resistance of the conductor connected in series, R2 = 4 Ω.Then the total resistance in the circuitR=R1 + R2Rs=20 Ω + 4 Ω = 24 Ω.The total potential difference across the two terminals of the batteryV = 6 V.Now by Ohm’s law, the current through the circuit is given byI=V/Rs=6 V/24 Ω=0.25 A.Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9 An electric lamp connected in series witha resistor of 4 Ω to a 6 V batteryElectricity185Applying Ohm’s law to the electric lamp and conductor separately,we get potential difference across the electric lamp,V1=20 Ω × 0.25 A=5 V;and,that across the conductor, V2  =  4 Ω × 0.25 A         =  1 V.Suppose that we like to replace the series combination of electriclamp and conductor by a single and equivalent resistor. Its resistancemust be such that a potential difference of 6 V across the battery\nterminals will cause a current of 0.25 A in the circuit. The resistanceR of this equivalent resistor would beR=V/I=6 V/ 0.25 A=24 Ω.This is the total resistance of the series circuit; it is equal to the sumof the two resistances.QUESTIONS?1.Draw a schematic diagram of a circuit consisting of a battery of threecells of 2 V each, a 5 Ω resistor, an 8 Ω resistor, and a 12 Ω resistor, anda plug key, all connected in series.2.Redraw the circuit of Question 1, putting in an ammeter to measure\nthe current through the resistors and a voltmeter to measure thepotential difference across the 12 Ω resistor. What would be the readingsin the ammeter and the voltmeter?11.6.2 Resistors in ParallelNow, let us consider the arrangement of three resistors joined in parallelwith a combination of cells (or a battery), as shown in Fig.11.7.Activity 11.6Activity 11.6Activity 11.6Activity 11.6Activity 11.6nMake a parallel combination, XY, of threeresistors having resistances R1, R2, and R3,respectively. Connect it with a battery, a\nplug key and an ammeter, as shown inFig. 11.10. Also connect a voltmeter in\nparallel with the combination of resistors.nPlug the key and note the ammeter reading.\nLet the current be I. Also take the voltmeterreading. It gives the potential difference V,across the combination. The potentialdifference across each resistor is also V. Thiscan be checked by connecting the voltmeter\nacross each individual resistor (seeFig. 11.11).Figure 11.10Figure 11.10Figure 11.10Figure 11.10Figure 11.10Science186nTake out the plug from the key. Remove the ammeter and voltmeter from the circuit.Insert the ammeter in series with the resistor R1, as shown in Fig. 11.11. Note the ammeterreading, I1.Figure 11.11Figure 11.11Figure 11.11Figure 11.11Figure 11.11nSimilarly, measure the currents through R2 and R3. Let these be I2 and I3, respectively.What is the relationship between I, I1, I2 and I3?It is observed that the total current I, is equal to the sum of theseparate currents through each branch of the combination.I = I1 + I2 + I3(11.15)Let Rp be the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination ofresistors. By applying Ohm’s law to the parallel combination of resistors,we haveI = V/Rp(11.16)On applying Ohm’s law to each resistor, we haveI1 = V /R1;    I2 = V /R2; and I3 = V /R3(11.17)From Eqs. (11.15) to (11.17), we have  V/Rp = V/R1 + V/R2 + V/R3or  1/Rp = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3(11.18)Thus, we may conclude that the reciprocal of the equivalent resistanceof a group of resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum of thereciprocals of the individual resistances.Example 11.8\nIn the circuit diagram given in Fig. 11.10, suppose the resistors R1,R2 and R3 have the values 5 Ω, 10 Ω, 30 Ω, respectively, which havebeen connected to a battery of 12 V. Calculate (a) the current througheach resistor, (b) the total current in the circuit, and (c) the total circuitresistance.SolutionR1 = 5 Ω, R2 = 10 Ω, and R3 = 30 Ω.Potential difference across the battery, V = 12 V.This is also the potential difference across each of the individualresistor; therefore, to calculate the current in the resistors, we useOhm’s law.The current  I1, through R1 =V/ R1I1=12 V/5 Ω  =2.4 A.Electricity187The current  I2, through R2=V/ R2I2=12 V/10 Ω=1.2 A.The current  I3, through R3=V/R3I3=12 V/30 Ω=0.4 A.The total current in the circuit,I= I1 + I2 + I3=(2.4 + 1.2 + 0.4) A=4 AThe total resistance Rp, is given by [Eq. (11.18)]11111510303pR=++=Thus, Rp = 3 Ω.Example 11.9If in Fig. 11.12, R1 = 10 Ω, R2 = 40 Ω, R3 = 30 Ω, R4 = 20 Ω, R5 = 60 Ω,and a 12 V battery is connected to the arrangement. Calculate\n(a) the total resistance in the circuit, and (b) the total current flowing\nin the circuit.SolutionSuppose we replace the parallel resistors R1 and R2 by anequivalent resistor of resistance, R′. Similarly we replacethe parallel resistors R3, R4 and R5 by an equivalent singleresistor of resistance R″. Then using Eq. (11.18), we have1/ R′ = 1/10 + 1/40=5/40; that is R′  = 8 Ω.Similarly,1/ R″=1/30 + 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60;that is, R″  = 10 Ω.Thus, the total resistance, R = R′ + R″ = 18 Ω.To calculate the current, we use Ohm’s law, and get I = V/R = 12 V/18 Ω = 0.67 A.We have seen that in a series circuit the current is constantthroughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to\nconnect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they\nneed currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example\n11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one\ncomponent fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.\nIf you have used ‘fairy lights’ to decorate buildings on festivals, onmarriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spendinglot of time in trouble-locating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb – each has\nto be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel\ncircuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total\nresistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (11.18). This is\nhelpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance andrequires different current to operate properly.Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12An electric circuit showing\nthe combination of series\nand parallel resistorsScience18811.7 HEA11.7 HEA11.7 HEA11.7 HEA11.7 HEATING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTWe know that a battery or a cell is a source of electrical energy. Thechemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference betweenits two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the currentthrough a resistor or a system of resistors connected to the battery. Wehave also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source\nhas to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part ofthe source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed intouseful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of thesource energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature ofgadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electricfan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other\nhand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration ofresistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually getsdissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heatingeffect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electricheater, electric iron etc.Consider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Letthe potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time duringwhich a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Qthrough a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supplyenergy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by thesource isPVVI=Qt=(11.19)Or the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is P × t,that is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? Thisenergy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady\ncurrent I, the amount of heat H produced in time t isH = VIt(11.20)QUESTIONS?1.Judge the equivalent resistance when the following are connected inparallel – (a) 1 Ω and 106 Ω, (b) 1 Ω and 103 Ω, and 106 Ω.2.An electric lamp of 100 Ω, a toaster of resistance 50 Ω, and a waterfilter of resistance 500 Ω are connected in parallel to a 220 V source.What is the resistance of an electric iron connected to the same sourcethat takes as much current as all three appliances, and what is thecurrent through it?3.What are the advantages of connecting electrical devices in parallelwith the battery instead of connecting them in series?4.How can three resistors of resistances 2 Ω, 3 Ω, and 6 Ω be connectedto give a total resistance of (a) 4 Ω, (b) 1 Ω?5.What is (a) the highest, (b) the lowest total resistance that can be securedby combinations of four coils of resistance 4 Ω, 8 Ω, 12 Ω, 24 Ω?Electricity189Applying Ohm’s law [Eq. (11.5)], we getH = I2 Rt(11.21)This is known as Joule’s law of heating. Thelaw implies that heat produced in a resistor is(i) directly proportional to the square of currentfor a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional toresistance for a given current, and (iii) directlyproportional to the time for which the current flowsthrough the resistor. In practical situations, whenan electric appliance is connected to a known\nvoltage source, Eq. (11.21) is used aftercalculating the current through it, using the\nrelation I = V/R.Example 11.10An electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating isat the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum.The voltage is 220 V. What are the current and the resistance in eachcase?SolutionFrom Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input isP = V IThus the current I = P/V(a)When heating is at the maximum rate,\nI = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A;and the resistance of the electric iron isR = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 Ω.(b)When heating is at the minimum rate,\nI = 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A;and the resistance of the electric iron isR = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15 Ω.Example 11.11\n100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 Ω resistance. Find thepotential difference across the resistor.Solution\nH = 100 J, R = 4 Ω, t = 1 s, V = ?From Eq. (11.21) we have the current through the resistor as\nI=√(H/Rt)=√[100 J/(4 Ω × 1 s)]=5 AThus the potential difference across the resistor, V [from Eq. (11.5)] isV=IR=5 A × 4 Ω=20 V.Figure 11.13Figure 11.13Figure 11.13Figure 11.13Figure 11.13A steady current in a purely resistive electric circuitScience19011.7.1 Practical Applications of Heating Effect ofElectric CurrentThe generation of heat in a conductor is an inevitable consequence ofelectric current. In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful\nelectrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heatingcan increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties.However, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications.The electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettleand electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s\nheating.The electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electricbulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is\npossible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such\nhigh temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as\ntungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The\nfilament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using\ninsulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemicallyinactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most ofthe power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part\nof it is in the form of light radiated.Another common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used inelectric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow\nof any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series withthe device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy ofappropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, leadetc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,\nthe temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and\nbreaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of\nporcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domesticpurposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric ironwhich consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current\nof (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A\nfuse must be used.QUESTIONS?1.Why does the cord of an electric heater not glow while the heating elementdoes?2.Compute the heat generated while transferring 96000 coulomb of charge\nin one hour through a potential difference of 50 V.3.An electric iron of resistance 20 Ω takes a current of 5 A.

This is also the rate of consumption of energy.Equation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipatedor consumed in an electric circuit. This is also termed as electric power.The power P is given byP  =  VIOrP  =  I2R = V2/R(11.22)The SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed bya device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential differenceof 1 V. Thus,       1 W  =  1 volt × 1 ampere = 1 V A(11.23)The unit ‘watt’ is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use amuch larger unit called ‘kilowatt’. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electricalenergy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is,\ntherefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when1 watt of power is used for 1 hour. The commercial unit of electric energyis kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as ‘unit’.1 kW h=1000 watt × 3600 second=3.6 × 106 watt second=3.6 × 106 joule (J)More to Know!Many people think that electrons are consumed in an electric circuit. This is wrong!We pay the electricity board or electric company to provide energy to move electronsthrough the electric gadgets like electric bulb, fan and engines. We pay for the energythat we use.Example 11.12\nAn electric bulb is connected to a 220 V generator. The current is0.50 A. What is the power of the bulb?SolutionP=VI=220 V × 0.50 A=110 J/s=110 W.Example 11.13An electric refrigerator rated 400 W operates 8 hour/day.

What could be the other effects of electriccurrent? We know that an electric current-carrying wire behaves like amagnet. Let us perform the following Activity to reinforce it.Activity 12.1Activity 12.1Activity 12.1Activity 12.1Activity 12.1nTake a straight thick copper wire and place itbetween the points X and Y in an electric circuit,as shown in Fig. 12.1. The wire XY is keptperpendicular to the plane of paper.nHorizontally place a small compass near to thiscopper wire. See the position of its needle.nPass the current through the circuit byinserting the key into the plug.nObserve the change in the position of thecompass needle.Figure 12.1Figure 12.1Figure 12.1Figure 12.1Figure 12.1Compass needle is deflected on passing an electric\ncurrent through a metallic conductorWe see that the needle is deflected. What does it mean?  It means thatthe electric current through the copper wire has produced a magneticeffect. Thus we can say that electricity and magnetism are linked to eachother. Then, what about the reverse possibility of an electric effect ofmoving magnets? In this Chapter we will study magnetic fields and such\nelectromagnetic effects. We shall also study about electromagnets whichinvolve the magnetic effect of electric current.Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851)Hans Christian Oersted, one of the leading scientists of the 19thcentury, played a crucial role in understanding electromagnetism. In1820 he accidentally discovered that a compass needle got deflectedwhen an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed nearby.Through this observation Oersted showed that electricity andmagnetism were related phenomena. His research later createdtechnologies such as the radio, television and fiber optics. The unit ofmagnetic field strength is named the oersted in his honor.ResistorLong straightconductorScience19612.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINESWe are familiar with the fact that a compass needle gets deflected whenbrought near a bar magnet. A compass needle is, in fact, a small barmagnet. The ends of the compass needle point approximately towardsnorth and south directions. The end pointing towards north is called northseeking or north pole. The other end that points towards south is calledsouth seeking or south pole. Through various activities we have observedthat like poles repel, while unlike poles of magnets attract each other.QUESTION?1.Why does a compass needle get deflected when brought neara bar magnet?Activity 12.2Activity 12.2Activity 12.2Activity 12.2Activity 12.2nFix a sheet of white paper on a drawingboard using some adhesive material.nPlace a bar magnet in the centre of it.nSprinkle some iron filings uniformlyaround the bar magnet (Fig. 12.2). Asalt-sprinkler may be used for thispurpose.nNow tap the board gently.nWhat do you observe?Figure 12.2Figure 12.2Figure 12.2Figure 12.2Figure 12.2Iron filings near the bar magnet align\nthemselves along the field lines.The iron filings arrange themselves in a pattern as shownFig. 12.2.  Why do the iron filings arrange in such a pattern? What doesthis pattern demonstrate?  The magnet exerts its influence in the regionsurrounding it.  Therefore the iron filings experience a force.  The forcethus exerted makes iron filings to arrange in a pattern. The region\nsurrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected,\nis said to have a magnetic field.  The lines along which the iron filingsalign themselves represent magnetic field lines.Are there other ways of obtaining magnetic field lines around a barmagnet?  Yes, you can yourself draw the field lines of a bar magnet.Activity 12.3Activity 12.3Activity 12.3Activity 12.3Activity 12.3nTake a small compass and a bar magnet.nPlace the magnet on a sheet of white paper fixed on a drawingboard, using some adhesive material.nMark the boundary of the magnet.nPlace the compass near the north pole of the magnet. How does\nit behave? The south pole of the needle points towards the north\npole of the magnet. The north pole of the compass is directed\naway from the north pole of the magnet.Magnetic Effects of Electric Current197Magnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude.The direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which anorth pole of the compass needle moves inside it.  Therefore it is takenby convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge atthe south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 12.4).\nInside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its\nnorth pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves.The relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree ofcloseness of the field lines. The field is stronger, that is, the force actingon the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are\ncrowded (see Fig. 12.4).No two field-lines are found to cross each other. If they did, it wouldmean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point\ntowards two directions, which is not possible.12.212.212.212.212.2MAMAMAMAMAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT-----CC\nCCCARRYINGARRYING\nARRYINGARRYINGARRYINGCONDUCTORCONDUCTORCONDUCTORCONDUCTORCONDUCTORIn Activity 12.1, we have seen that an electric current through ametallic conductor produces a magnetic field around it. In order to\nfind the direction of the field produced let us repeat the activity in the\nfollowing way –Figure 12.3Figure 12.3Figure 12.3Figure 12.3Figure 12.3Drawing a magnetic field line with the help of a\ncompass needlenMark the position of two ends of the needle.nNow move the needle to a new positionsuch that its south pole occupies theposition previously occupied by its north\npole.nIn this way, proceed step by step till you\nreach the south pole of the magnet as\nshown in Fig. 12.3.nJoin the points marked on the paper by a\nsmooth curve.  This curve represents\na field line.nRepeat the above procedure and draw as\nmany lines as you can. You will get apattern shown in Fig. 12.4. These linesrepresent the magnetic field around themagnet. These are known as magnetic\nfield lines.nObserve the deflection in the compass\nneedle as you move it along a field line.\nThe deflection increases as the needle ismoved towards the poles.Figure 12.4Figure 12.4Figure 12.4Figure 12.4Figure 12.4Field lines around a bar magnetScience19812.2.1Magnetic Field due to a Current through a StraightConductorWhat determines the pattern of the magnetic field generated by a currentthrough a conductor? Does the pattern depend on the shape of theconductor? We shall investigate this with an activity.We shall first consider the pattern of the magnetic field around astraight conductor carrying current.Activity 12.4Activity 12.4Activity 12.4Activity 12.4Activity 12.4nTake a long straight copper wire, two or three cells of 1.5 V each, and a plug key. Connectall of them in series as shown in Fig. 12.5 (a).nPlace the straight wire parallel to and over a compass needle.nPlug the key in the circuit.nObserve the direction of deflection of the north pole of the needle. If the current flows fromnorth to south, as shown in Fig. 12.5 (a), the north pole of the compass needle would movetowards the east.nReplace the cell connections in the circuit as shown in Fig. 12.5 (b). This would result in\nthe change of the direction of current through the copper wire, that is, from south tonorth.nObserve the change in the direction of deflection of the needle. You will see that now theneedle moves in opposite direction, that is, towards the west [Fig. 12.5 (b)]. It means that\nthe direction of magnetic field produced by the electric current is also reversed.Figure 12.5Figure 12.5Figure 12.5Figure 12.5Figure 12.5A simple electric circuit in which a straight copper wire is placed parallel to and over a compassneedle. The deflection in the needle becomes opposite when the direction of the current is reversed.(a)(b)Activity 12.5Activity 12.5Activity 12.5Activity 12.5Activity 12.5nTake a battery (12 V), a variable resistance (or a rheostat), anammeter (0–5 A), a plug key, connecting wires and a long straightthick copper wire.nInsert the thick wire through the centre, normal to the plane of a\nrectangular cardboard.  Take care that the cardboard is fixed anddoes not slide up or down.Magnetic Effects of Electric Current199What happens to the deflection of the compass needle placed at agiven point if the current in the copper wire is changed? To see this, varythe current in the wire. We find that the deflection in the needle alsochanges. In fact, if the current is increased, the deflection also increases.\nIt indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a givenpoint increases as the current through the wire increases.What happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is movedaway from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains thesame? To see this, now place the compass at a farther point from theconducting wire (say at point Q). What change do you observe? We seethat the deflection in the needle decreases. Thus the magnetic field\nproduced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distancefrom it increases. From Fig. 12.6, it can be noticed that the concentriccircles representing the magnetic field around a current-carrying straightwire become larger and larger as we move away from it.12.2.2 Right-Hand Thumb RuleA convenient way of finding the direction of magnetic field associatedwith a current-carrying conductor is given in Fig. 12.7.nConnect the copper wire vertically between thepoints X and Y, as shown in Fig. 12.6 (a), in\nseries with the battery, a plug and key.nSprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the\ncardboard. (You may use a salt sprinkler for thispurpose.)nKeep the variable of the rheostat at a fixedposition and note the current through theammeter.nClose the key so that a current flows through\nthe wire. Ensure that the copper wire placedbetween the points X and Y remains verticallystraight.nGently tap the cardboard a few times. Observe\nthe pattern of the iron filings. You would findthat the iron filings align themselves showing\na pattern of concentric circles around the\ncopper wire (Fig. 12.6).nWhat do these concentric circles represent?They represent the magnetic field lines.nHow can the direction of the magnetic field befound? Place a compass at a point (say P) over\na circle. Observe the direction of the needle. Thedirection of the north pole of the compassneedle would give the direction of the field lines\nproduced by the electric current through the\nstraight wire at point P. Show the direction byan arrow.nDoes the direction of magnetic field lines get\nreversed if the direction of current through the\nstraight copper wire is reversed? Check it.Figure 12.6Figure 12.6Figure 12.6Figure 12.6Figure 12.6(a) A pattern of concentric circles indicating\nthe field lines of a magnetic field around a\nstraight conducting wire. The arrows in the\ncircles show the direction of the field lines.\n(b) A close up of the pattern obtained.(a)(b)VariableresistanceScience200Imagine that you are holding a current-carrying straightconductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towardsthe direction of current. Then your fingers will wrap around theconductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field, asshown in Fig. 12.7. This is known as the right-hand thumb rule*.Example 12.1\nA current through a horizontal power line flows in east to westdirection. What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directlybelow it and at a point directly above it?SolutionThe current is in the east-west direction. Applying the right-handthumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below orabove the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire,when viewed from the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewedfrom the west end.Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Right-hand thumb rule*This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a\ncorkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of\ncorkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field.12.2.3Magnetic Field due to a Current through aCircular LoopWe have so far observed the pattern of the magnetic field linesproduced around a current-carrying straight wire. Supposethis straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and acurrent is passed through it. How would the magnetic field\nlines look like? We know that the magnetic field producedby a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the\ndistance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying\ncircular loop, the concentric circles representing the magneticfield around it would become larger and larger as we moveaway from the wire (Fig. 12.8). By the time we reach at the\ncentre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles wouldappear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying\ncurrent would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as\nstraight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the righthand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wirecontributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction\nwithin the loop.Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Magnetic field lines of the field\nproduced by a current-carrying\ncircular loop?QUESTIONS1.Draw magnetic field lines around a bar magnet.2.List the properties of magnetic field lines.3.Why don’t two magnetic field lines intersect each other?Magnetic Effects of Electric Current201We know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carryingwire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it.Therefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced isn times as large as that produced by a single turn. This is because thecurrent in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due toeach turn then just adds up.Activity 12.6Activity 12.6Activity 12.6Activity 12.6Activity 12.6nTake a rectangular cardboard having two holes.Insert a circular coil having large number of turnsthrough them, normal to the plane of the cardboard.nConnect the ends of the coil in series with a battery,\na key and a rheostat, as shown in Fig. 12.9.nSprinkle iron filings uniformly on the cardboard.nPlug the key.nTap the cardboard gently a few times. Note the\npattern of the iron filings that emerges on thecardboard.Figure 12.9Figure 12.9Figure 12.9Figure 12.9Figure 12.9Magnetic field produced by a current-\ncarrying circular coil.12.2.4 Magnetic Field due to a Current in a SolenoidA coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrappedclosely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid. The patternof the magnetic field lines around a current-carrying solenoid isshown in Fig. 12.10. Compare the pattern of the field with themagnetic field around a bar magnet (Fig. 12.4). Do they looksimilar? Yes, they are similar. In fact, one end of the solenoidbehaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the\nsouth pole. The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form ofparallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field isthe same at all points inside the solenoid. That is, the field isuniform inside the solenoid.A strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can beused to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron,when placed inside the coil (Fig. 12.11). The magnet so formed iscalled an electromagnet.Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Field lines of the magnetic field\nthrough and around a current\ncarrying solenoid.Figure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11\nA current-carrying solenoid coil\nis used to magnetise steel rod\ninside it – an electromagnet.QUESTIONS?1.Consider a circular loop of wire lying inthe plane of the table. Let the currentpass through the loop clockwise. Applythe right-hand rule to find out thedirection of the magnetic field insideand outside the loop.2.The magnetic field in a given region isuniform. Draw a diagram to represent it.Science20212.312.312.312.312.3FORCE ON A CURRENTFORCE ON A CURRENTFORCE ON A CURRENTFORCE ON A CURRENTFORCE ON A CURRENT-----CCCCCARRYING CONDUCTORARRYING CONDUCTORARRYING CONDUCTORARRYING CONDUCTORARRYING CONDUCTORIN A MAGNETIC FIELDIN A MAGNETIC FIELDIN A MAGNETIC FIELDIN A MAGNETIC FIELDIN A MAGNETIC FIELDWe have learnt that an electric current flowing through a conductorproduces a magnetic field. The field so produced exerts a force on amagnet placed in the vicinity of the conductor. French scientist AndreMarie Ampere (1775–1836) suggested that the magnet must also exert\nan equal and opposite force on the current-carrying conductor. The forcedue to a magnetic field acting on a current-carrying conductor can be\ndemonstrated through the following activity.3.Choose the correct option.The magnetic field inside a long straight solenoid-carrying current(a)is zero.(b)decreases as we move towards its end.(c)increases as we move towards its end.(d)is the same at all points.Activity 12.7Activity 12.7Activity 12.7Activity 12.7Activity 12.7nTake a small aluminium rod AB (of about 5 cm). Usingtwo connecting wires suspend it horizontally from astand, as shown in Fig. 12.12.nPlace a strong horse-shoe magnet in such a way that\nthe rod lies between the two poles with the magneticfield directed upwards. For this put the north pole ofthe magnet vertically below and south pole verticallyabove the aluminium rod (Fig. 12.12).nConnect the aluminium rod in series with a battery,\na key and a rheostat.nNow pass a current through the aluminium rod from\nend B to end A.nWhat do you observe? It is observed that the rod is\ndisplaced towards the left. You will notice that the rodgets displaced.nReverse the direction of current flowing through therod and observe the direction of its displacement. It isnow towards the right.Why does the rod get displaced?Figure 12.12Figure 12.12Figure 12.12Figure 12.12Figure 12.12A current-carrying rod, AB, experiences\na force perpendicular to its length and\nthe magnetic field. Support for the\nmagnet is not shown here, for simplicity.The displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that aforce is exerted on the current-carrying aluminium rod when it is placedin a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is alsoreversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed.Now change the direction of field to vertically downwards byinterchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed thatMagnetic Effects of Electric Current203the direction of force acting on the current-carrying rod gets reversed. Itshows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the\ndirection of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experimentshave shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitudeof the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right anglesto the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use asimple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor.In Activity 12.7, we considered thedirection of the current and that of the magnetic\nfield perpendicular to each other and foundthat the force is perpendicular to both of them.The three directions can be illustrated througha simple rule, called Fleming’s left-hand rule.According to this rule, stretch the thumb,\nforefinger and middle finger of your left handsuch that they are mutually perpendicular(Fig. 12.13). If the first finger points in thedirection of magnetic field and the secondfinger in the direction of current, then the\nthumb will point in the direction of motion orthe force acting on the conductor.Devices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fieldsinclude electric motor, electric generator, loudspeakers, microphonesand measuring instruments.Example 12.2An electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shownin Fig. 12.14. The direction of force acting on the electron will be(a)to the right.(b)to the left.(c)out of the page.(d)into the page.SolutionAnswer is option (d). The direction of force is perpendicular to the\ndirection of magnetic field and current as given by Fleming’s left handrule. Recall that the direction of current is taken opposite to the directionof motion of electrons. The force is therefore directed into the page.Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Fleming’s left-hand ruleFigure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14QUESTIONS?1.Which of the following property of a proton can change while it movesfreely in a magnetic field?

One of the wires in this supply, usually withred insulation cover, is called live wire (or positive). Another wire, withblack insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, thepotential difference between the two is 220 V.At the meter-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricitymeter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected\nto the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separatecircuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as\ngeysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for\nbulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, isusually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house.\nThis is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances thathave a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster, table fan,refrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, whichprovides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, itensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance\nkeeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe\nelectric shock.2.In Activity 12.7, how do we think the displacement of rod AB will beaffected if (i) current in rod AB is increased; (ii) a stronger horse-shoemagnet is used; and (iii) length of the rod AB is increased?3.A positively-charged particle (alpha-particle) projected towards west isdeflected towards north by a magnetic field. The direction of magneticfield is(a)towards south(b)towards east(c)downward(d)upwardMagnetism in medicineAn electric current always produces a magnetic field. Even weak ion currents thattravel along the nerve cells in our body produce magnetic fields. When we touchsomething, our nerves carry an electric impulse to the muscles we need to use. Thisimpulse produces a temporary magnetic field. These fields are very weak and areabout one-billionth of the earth’s magnetic field. Two main organs in the humanbody where the magnetic field produced is significant, are the heart and the brain. Themagnetic field inside the body forms the basis of obtaining the images of different body\nparts. This is done using a technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Analysisof these images helps in medical diagnosis. Magnetism has, thus, got important usesin medicine.More to Know!Magnetic Effects of Electric Current205Figure 12.15Figure 12.15Figure 12.15Figure 12.15Figure 12.15 A schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuitsQUESTIONS?Figure 12.15 gives a schematic diagram of one of the commondomestic circuits. In each separate circuit, different appliances can beconnected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a\nseparate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order\nthat each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected\nparallel to each other.Electric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. Wehave already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous\nchapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuseprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damageby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.\nOverloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket.1.Name two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits andappliances.2.An electric oven of 2 kW power rating is operated in a domestic electriccircuit (220 V) that has a current rating of 5 A. What result do youexpect? Explain.3.What precaution should be taken to avoid the overloading of domestic\nelectric circuits?Science206What you have learntnA compass needle is a small magnet. Its one end, which points towards north, iscalled a north pole, and the other end, which points towards south, is called asouth pole.nA magnetic field exists in the region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of\nthe magnet can be detected.nField lines are used to represent a magnetic field. A field line is the path along\nwhich a hypothetical free north pole would tend to move. The direction of themagnetic field at a point is given by the direction that a north pole placed at that\npoint would take. Field lines are shown closer together where the magnetic field is\ngreater.nA metallic wire carrying an electric current has associated with it a magnetic field.\nThe field lines about the wire consist of a series of concentric circles whose directionis given by the right-hand rule.nThe pattern of the magnetic field around a conductor due to an electric current\nflowing through it depends on the shape of the conductor. The magnetic field of asolenoid carrying a current is similar to that of a bar magnet.nAn electromagnet consists of a core of soft iron wrapped around with a coil ofinsulated copper wire.nA current-carrying conductor when placed in a magnetic field experiences a force.\nIf the direction of the field and that of the current are mutually perpendicular to\neach other, then the force acting on the conductor will be perpendicular to bothand will be given by Fleming’s left-hand rule.nIn our houses we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz. One\nof the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is ofblack insulation, which is a neutral wire. The potential difference between the twois 220 V. The third is the earth wire that has green insulation and this is connectedto a metallic body deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that\nany leakage of current to a metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user.nFuse is the most important safety device, used for protecting the circuits due to\nshort-circuiting or overloading of the circuits.Magnetic Effects of Electric Current207EXERCISES1.Which of the following correctly describes the magnetic field near a longstraight wire?(a)The field consists of straight lines perpendicular to the wire.(b) The field consists of straight lines parallel to the wire.(c)The field consists of radial lines originating from the wire.(d)The field consists of concentric circles centred on the wire.2.At the time of short circuit, the current in the circuit(a)reduces substantially.(b)does not change.(c)increases heavily.(d)vary continuously.3.State whether the following statements are true or false.(a)The field at the centre of a long circular coil carrying current will beparallel straight lines.(b)A wire with a green insulation is usually the live wire of an electric supply.4.List two methods of producing magnetic fields.5.When is the force experienced by a current–carrying conductor placed in a magneticfield largest?6.Imagine that you are sitting in a chamber with your back to one wall.

Our elders tellus that the ‘environment’ is not what it used to be earlier; others say thatwe should work in a healthy ‘environment’; and global summits involving\nthe developed and developing countries are regularly held to discuss‘environmental’ issues. In this chapter, we shall be studying how variouscomponents in the environment interact with each other and how weimpact the environment.13.1 ECO13.1 ECO13.1 ECO13.1 ECO13.1 ECO-SYSTEM — WHA-SYSTEM — WHA-SYSTEM — WHA-SYSTEM — WHA-SYSTEM — WHAT ARE ITS COMPONENTS?T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?All organisms such as plants, animals, microorganisms and humanbeings as well as the physical surroundings interact with each otherand maintain a balance in nature. All the interacting organisms in anarea together with the non-living constituents of the environment forman ecosystem. Thus, an ecosystem consists of biotic componentscomprising living organisms and abiotic components comprisingphysical factors like temperature, rainfall, wind, soil and minerals.For example, if you visit a garden you will find different plants, suchas grasses, trees; flower bearing plants like rose, jasmine, sunflower;and animals like frogs, insects and birds. All these living organisms\ninteract with each other and their growth, reproduction and other\nactivities are affected by the abiotic components of ecosystem. So a garden\nis an ecosystem. Other types of ecosystems are forests, ponds and lakes.\nThese are natural ecosystems while gardens and crop-fields are human-\nmade (artificial) ecosystems.nYou might have seen an aquarium. Let us try to design one.nWhat are the things that we need to keep in mind when we createan aquarium? The fish would need a free space for swimming (itcould be a large jar), water, oxygen and food.nWe can provide oxygen through an oxygen pump (aerator) andfish food which is available in the market.Our Environment209nIf we add a few aquatic plants and animals it can become a self-sustaining system. Can you think how this happens? An aquariumis an example of a human-made ecosystem.nCan we leave the aquarium as such after we set it up? Why doesit have to be cleaned once in a while? Do we have to clean pondsor lakes in the same manner? Why or why not?We have seen in earlier classes that organisms can be grouped asproducers, consumers and decomposers according to the manner inwhich they obtain their sustenance from the environment. Let us recall\nwhat we have learnt through the self sustaining ecosystem created by\nus above. Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar\nand starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the\nSun in the presence of chlorophyll? All green plants and certain bacteria\nwhich can produce food by photosynthesis come under this category\nand are called the producers.Organisms depend on the producers either directly or indirectly fortheir sustenance? These organisms which consume the food produced,\neither directly from producers or indirectly by feeding on other consumers\nare the consumers. Consumers can be classed variously as herbivores,\ncarnivores, omnivores and parasites. Can you give examples for each ofthese categories of consumers?nImagine the situation where you do not clean the  aquarium andsome fish and plants have died. Have you ever thought what\nhappens when an organism dies? The microorganisms, comprising\nbacteria and fungi, break-down the dead remains and wasteproducts of organisms. These microorganisms are the decomposersas they break-down the complex organic substances into simple\ninorganic substances that go into the soil and are used up once\nmore by the plants. What will happen to the garbage, and dead\nanimals and plants in their absence? Will the natural replenishment\nof the soil take place, even if decomposers are not there?Activity 13.2Activity 13.2Activity 13.2Activity 13.2Activity 13.2nWhile creating an aquarium did you take care not to put an aquaticanimal which would eat others? What would have happenedotherwise?nMake groups and discuss how each of the above groups of\norganisms are dependent on each other.nWrite the aquatic organisms in order of who eats whom and forma chain of at least three steps.  →  → nWould you consider any one group of organisms to be of primaryimportance? Why or why not?Science210Figure 13.2Figure 13.2Figure 13.2Figure 13.2Figure 13.2Trophic levels13.1.1 Food Chains and WebsIn Activity 13.4 we have formed a series of organisms feedingon one another. This series or organisms taking part atvarious biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 13.1).Each step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level.The autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level.\nThey fix up the solar energy and make it available forheterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primaryconsumers come at the second, small carnivores or the\nsecondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores orthe tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 13.2).We know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to provide usenergy to do work. Thus the interactions among various\ncomponents of the environment involves flow of energy fromone component of the system to another. As we have studied,the autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight andconvert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all theactivities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes\nto the heterotrophs and decomposers. However, as we saw inthe previous Chapter on ‘Sources of Energy’, when one form\nof energy is changed to another, some energy is lost to theenvironment in forms which cannot be used again. The flowof energy between various components of the environmenthas been extensively studied and it has been found that –nThe green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert itinto food energy.nWhen green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great dealof energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goesinto digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth\nand reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turnedinto its own body and made available for the next level ofconsumers.nTherefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amountof organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the nextlevel of consumers.nSince so little energy is available for the next level of consumers,food chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The lossof energy at each step is so great that very little usable energyremains after four trophic levels.nThere are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower\ntrophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of theproducers.nThe length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism\nis generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which inturn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straightline food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branchinglines called a food web (Fig. 13.3).Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Food chain in nature\n(a) in forest, (b) in\ngrassland and (c) in a\npondOur Environment211From the energy flow diagram (Fig. 13.4),two things become clear. Firstly, the flow ofenergy is unidirectional. The energy that iscaptured by the autotrophs does not revertback to the solar input and the energy whichpasses to the herbivores does not come backto autotrophs. As it moves progressivelythrough the various trophic levels it is nolonger available to the previous level.Secondly, the energy available at each trophiclevel gets diminished progressively due to lossof energy at each level.Another interesting aspect of food chainis how unknowingly some harmfulchemicals enter our bodies through the food\nchain. You have read in Class IX how watergets polluted. One of the reasons is the use of\nseveral pesticides and other chemicals to\nprotect our crops from diseases and pests.These chemicals are either washed down intothe soil or into the water bodies. From the\nsoil, these are absorbed by the plants along\nwith water and minerals, and from the water\nbodies these are taken up by aquatic plantsFigure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Diagram showing flow of energy in an ecosystemFigure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3Food web, consisting of\nmany food chainsScience212Activity 13.3Activity 13.3Activity 13.3Activity 13.3Activity 13.3and animals. This is one of the ways in which they enter the food chain.As these chemicals are not degradable, these get accumulated\nprogressively at each trophic level. As human beings occupy the toplevel in any food chain, the maximum concentration of these chemicalsget accumulated in our bodies. This phenomenon is known as biological\nmagnification. This is the reason why our food grains such as wheat\nand rice, vegetables and fruits, and even meat, contain varying amounts\nof pesticide residues. They cannot always be removed by washing or\nother means.QUESTIONS?1.What are trophic levels? Give an example of a food chain and state thedifferent trophic levels in it.2.What is the role of decomposers in the ecosystem?13.213.213.213.213.2HOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THEHOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THEHOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THEHOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THEHOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THEENVIRONMENT?ENVIRONMENT?ENVIRONMENT?ENVIRONMENT?ENVIRONMENT?We are an integral part of the environment. Changes in the environmentaffect us and our activities change the environment around us. We havealready seen in Class IX how our activities pollute the environment. Inthis chapter, we shall be looking at two of the environmental problemsin detail, that is, depletion of the ozone layer and waste disposal.13.2.1 Ozone Layer and How it is Getting DepletedOzone (O3) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. While O2,which we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms oflife. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However, at the higher levels of theatmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface\nof the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. This radiationnNewspaper reports about pesticide levels in ready-made food itemsare often seen these days and some states have banned theseproducts. Debate in groups the need for such bans.nWhat do you think would be the source of pesticides in these food\nitems? Could pesticides get into our bodies from this source throughother food products too?nDiscuss what methods could be applied to reduce our intake of\npesticides.Our Environment213Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4is highly damaging to organisms, for example, it is known to cause skincancer in human beings.Ozone at the higher levels of the atmosphere is a product of UVradiation acting on oxygen (O2) molecule. The higher energy UVradiations split apart some moleculer oxygen (O2) into free oxygen (O)atoms. These atoms then combine with the molecular oxygen to formozone as shown—OO+O2UV→OOO23Ozone)+→(The amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply inthe 1980s. This decrease has been linked to synthetic chemicals like\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used as refrigerants and in fireextinguishers. In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme(UNEP) succeeded in forging an agreement to freeze CFC production at1986 levels. It is now mandatory for all the manufacturing companiesto make CFC-free refrigerators throughout the world.nCollect waste material from your homes. This could include allthe waste generated during a day, like kitchen waste (spoilt food,vegetable peels, used tea leaves, milk packets and empty cartons),waste paper, empty medicine bottles/strips/bubble packs, old andtorn clothes and broken footwear.nBury this material in a pit in the school garden or if there is nospace available, you can collect the material in an old bucket/flower pot and cover with at least 15 cm of soil.nKeep this material moist and observe at 15-day intervals.nWhat are the materials that remain unchanged over long periodsof time?nWhat are the materials which change their form and structure\nover time?nOf these materials that are changed, which ones change the fastest?nFind out from the library, internet or newspaper reports, which\nchemicals are responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer.nFind out if the regulations put in place to control the emission of\nthese chemicals have succeeded in reducing the damage to theozone layer. Has the size of the hole in the ozone layer changed inrecent years?13.2.2 Managing the Garbage we ProduceIn our daily activities, we generate a lot of material that are thrownaway. What are some of these waste materials? What happens after we\nthrow them away? Let us perform an activity to find answers to these\nquestions.Science214We have seen in the chapter on ‘Life Processes’ that the food we eat isdigested by various enzymes in our body. Have you ever wondered whythe same enzyme does not break-down everything we eat? Enzymes are\nspecific in their action, specific enzymes are needed for the break-downof a particular substance. That is why we will not get any energy if wetry to eat coal! Because of this, many human-made materials like plastics\nwill not be broken down by the action of bacteria or other saprophytes.These materials will be acted upon by physical processes like heat andpressure, but under the ambient conditions found in our environment,\nthese persist for a long time.Substances that are broken down by biological processes are saidto be biodegradable. How many of the substances you buried were\nbiodegradable? Substances that are not broken down in this mannerare said to be non-biodegradable. These substances may be inert andsimply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various\nmembers of the eco-system.Activity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6nUse the library or internet to find out more about biodegradableand non-biodegradable substances.nHow long are various non-biodegradable substances expected to\nlast in our environment?nThese days, new types of plastics which are said to be biodegradable\nare available. Find out more about such materials and whetherthey do or do not harm the environment.1.Why are some substances biodegradable and some non-biodegradable?2.Give any two ways in which biodegradable substances would affect the\nenvironment.3.Give any two ways in which non-biodegradable substances would affectthe environment.QUESTIONS?Visit any town or city, and we are sure to find heaps of garbage all overthe place. Visit any place of tourist interest and we are sure to find theplace littered with empty food wrappers. In the earlier classes we have\ntalked about this problem of dealing with the garbage that we generate. Let\nus now look at the problem a bit more deeply.Our Environment215Activity 13.7Activity 13.7Activity 13.7Activity 13.7Activity 13.7nFind out what happens to the waste generated at home.

Changes in attitude also have a role to play,with more and more things we use becoming disposable. Changes in\npackaging have resulted in much of our waste becoming non-\nbiodegradable. What do you think will be the impact of these on our\nenvironment?Activity 13.8Activity 13.8Activity 13.8Activity 13.8Activity 13.8nFind out how the sewage in your locality is treated.

The introduction ofdisposable cups was hailed as a step forward for reasons of hygiene. No one at that time\nperhaps thought about the impact caused by the disposal of millions of these cups on a\ndaily basis. Some time back, kulhads, that is, disposable cups made of clay, weresuggested as an alternative. But a little thought showed that making these kulhads ona large scale would result in the loss of the fertile top-soil. Now disposable paper-cupsare being used. What do you think are the advantages of disposable paper-cups overdisposable plastic cups?Think it overScience216Activity 13.9Activity 13.9Activity 13.9Activity 13.9Activity 13.9nSearch the internet or library to find out what hazardous materialshave to be dealt with while disposing of electronic items.

    "input": "Biology is the science of life forms and living processes. The living worldcomprises an amazing diversity of living organisms. Early man couldeasily perceive the difference between inanimate matter and livingTorganisms. Early man deified some of the inanimate matter (wind, sea,fire etc.) and some among the animals and plants. A common feature ofall such forms of inanimate and animate objects was the sense of aweTor fear that they evoked. The description of living organisms includinghuman beings began much later in human history. Societies whichindulged in anthropocentric view of biology could register limitedTprogress in biological knowledge. Systematic and monumentaldescription of life forms brought in, out of necessity, detailed systemsof identification, nomenclature and classification. The biggest spin offTof such studies was the recognition of the sharing of similarities amongliving organisms both horizontally and vertically. That all present dayliving organisms are related to each other and also to all organismsTthat ever lived on this earth, was a revelation which humbled man andled to cultural movements for conservation of biodiversity. In thefollowing chapters of this unit, you will get a description, includingTclassification, of animals and plants from a taxonomist’s perspective.DIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLDChapter 1The Living WorldChapter 2TBiological ClassificationChapter 3Plant KingdomChapter 4Animal KingdomUNIT 12024-25Born on 5 July 1904, in Kempten, Germany, ERNST MAYR, theHarvard University evolutionary biologist who has been called‘The Darwin of the 20th century’, was one of the 100 greatestscientists of all time. Mayr joined Harvard’s Faculty of ArtsTand Sciences in 1953 and retired in 1975, assuming the titleuAlexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology Emeritus. Throughouthis nearly 80-year career, his research spanned ornithology,taxonomy, zoogeography, evolution, systematics, and theThistory and philosophy of biology. He almost single-handedlyTmade the origin of species diversity the central question ofTevolutionary biology that it is today. He also pioneered theTcurrently accepted definition of a biological species. Mayr wasTawarded the three prizes widely regarded as the triple crown ofbiology: the Balzan Prize in 1983, the International Prize forBiology in 1994, and the Crafoord Prize in 1999. Mayr died atthe age of 100 in the year 2004.Ernst Mayr(1904 – 2004)2024-25How wonderful is the living world ! The wide range of living types isamazing. The extraordinary habitats in which we find living organisms,be it cold mountains, deciduous forests, oceans, fresh water lakes, desertsor hot springs, leave us speechless. The beauty of a galloping horse, ofTthe migrating birds, the valley of flowers or the attacking shark evokesawe and a deep sense of wonder. The ecological conflict and cooperationamong members of a population and among populations of a communityor even the molecular traffic inside a cell make us deeply reflect on – whatindeed is life? This question has two implicit questions within it. The firstis a technical one and seeks answer to what living is as opposed to theTnon-living, and the second is a philosophical one, and seeks answer towhat the purpose of life is. As scientists, we shall not attempt answeringthe second question. We will try to reflect on – what is living?1.1DIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLDIf you look around you will see a large variety of living organisms, be itTpotted plants, insects, birds, your pets or other animals and plants. ThereTare also several organisms that you cannot see with your naked eye butthey are all around you. If you were to increase the area that you makeobservations in, the range and variety of organisms that you see wouldTincrease. Obviously, if you were to visit a dense forest, you would probablysee a much greater number and kinds of living organisms in it. Eachdifferent kind of plant, animal or organism that you see, represents aTspecies. The number of species that are known and described rangebetween 1.7-1.8 million. This refers to biodiversity or the number andTHE LIVING WORLDCHAPTER  11.1Diversity in theLiving World1.2TaxonomicCategories2024-254BIOLOGYtypes of organisms present on earth. We should remember here that aswe explore new areas, and even old ones, new organisms are continuouslybeing identified.As stated earlier, there are millions of plants and animals in the world;we know the plants and animals in our own area by their local names.TThese local names would vary from place to place, even within a country.TProbably you would recognise the confusion that would be created if weTdid not find ways and means to talk to each other, to refer to organismswe are talking about.Hence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organismssuch that a particular organism is known by the same name all over theTworld. This process is called nomenclature. Obviously, nomenclatureor naming is only possible when the organism is described correctly andTwe know to what organism the name is attached to. This is identification.In order to facilitate the study, number of scientists have establishedprocedures to assign a scientific name to each known organism.  This isTacceptable to biologists all over the world. For plants, scientific names areTbased on agreed principles and criteria, which are provided in InternationalTCode for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). You may ask, how  are animalsnamed? Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of ZoologicalTNomenclature (ICZN). The scientific names ensure that each organismThas only one name. Description of any organism should enable the people(in any part of the world) to arrive at the same name. They also ensurethat such a name has not been used for any other known organism.Biologists follow universally accepted principles to provide scientificnames to known organisms.  Each name has two components – theRGeneric name and the specific epithet. This system of providing aname with two components is called Binomial nomenclature. Thisnaming system given by Carolus Linnaeus is being practised by biologistsTall over the world. This naming system using a two word format wasTfound convenient. Let us take the example of mango to understand theTway of providing scientific names better. The scientific name of mango iswritten as Mangifera indica. Let us see how it is a binomial name.  In thisname Mangifera represents the genus while indica, is a particular species,or a specific epithet. Other universal rules of nomenclature are as follows:1.Biological names are generally in Latin and written in italics.They are Latinised or derived from Latin irrespective of theirorigin.2.The first word in a biological name represents the genus whilethe second component denotes the specific epithet.3.Both the words in a biological name, when handwritten, areseparately underlined, or printed in italics to indicate their Latinorigin.2024-25THE LIVING WORLD54.The first word denoting the genus starts with a capital letterwhile the specific epithet starts with a small letter. It can beillustrated with the example of Mangifera indica.Name of the author appears after the specific epithet, i.e., at the end ofthe biological name and is written in an abbreviated form, e.g., Mangiferaindica Linn. It indicates that this species was first described by Linnaeus.Since it is nearly impossible to study all the living organisms, it isnecessary to devise some means to make this possible. This process isclassification. Classification is the process by which anything is groupedinto convenient categories based on some easily observable characters.TFor example, we easily recognise groups such as plants or animals orTdogs, cats or insects. The moment we use any of these terms, we associateTcertain characters with the organism in that group. What image do youTsee when you think of a dog ? Obviously, each one of us will see ‘dogs’and not ‘cats’. Now, if we were to think of ‘Alsatians’ we know what we aretalking about. Similarly, suppose we were to say ‘mammals’, you would,Tof course, think of animals with external ears and body hair. Likewise, inplants, if we try to talk of ‘Wheat’, the picture in each of our minds will beTof wheat plants, not of rice or any other plant. Hence, all these - ‘Dogs’,T‘Cats’, ‘Mammals’, ‘Wheat’, ‘Rice’, ‘Plants’, ‘Animals’, etc., are convenientTcategories we use to study organisms. The scientific term for theseTcategories is taxa. Here you must recognise that taxa can indicatecategories at very different levels. ‘Plants’ – also form a taxa. ‘Wheat’ isTalso a taxa. Similarly, ‘animals’, ‘mammals’, ‘dogs’ are all taxa – but youTknow that a dog is a mammal and mammals are animals. Therefore,T‘animals’, ‘mammals’ and ‘dogs’ represent taxa at different levels.Hence, based on characteristics, all living organisms can be classifiedinto different taxa. This process of classification is taxonomy. Externaland internal structure, along with the structure of cell, developmentTprocess and ecological information of organisms are essential and formTthe basis of modern taxonomic studies.Hence, characterisation, identification, classification and nomenclatureare the processes that are basic to taxonomy.Taxonomy is not something new. Human beings have always beeninterested in knowing more and more about the various kinds ofTorganisms, particularly with reference to their own use. In early days,Thuman beings needed to find sources for their basic needs of food, clothingTand shelter. Hence, the earliest classifications were based on the ‘uses’ ofvarious organisms.Human beings were, since long, not only interested in knowing moreabout different kinds of organisms and their diversities, but also theTrelationships among them. This branch of study was referred to asRsystematics. The word systematics is derived from the Latin word‘systema’ which means systematic arrangement of organisms.  Linnaeus2024-256BIOLOGYused Systema Naturae as the  title of his publication.  The scope ofsystematics was later enlarged to include identification, nomenclatureand classification. Systematics takes into account evolutionaryTrelationships between organisms.1.2TAXONOMIC CATEGORIESClassification is not a single step process but involves hierarchy of stepsin which each step represents a rank or category.  Since the category is apart of overall taxonomic arrangement, it is called the taxonomic categoryand all categories together constitute the taxonomic hierarchy.  Eachcategory, referred to as a unit of classification, in fact, represents a rankand is commonly termed as taxon (pl.: taxa).Taxonomic categories and hierarchy can be illustrated by an example.Insects represent a group of organisms sharing common features likeTthree pairs of jointed legs.  It means insects are recognisable concreteobjects which can be classified, and thus were given a rank or category.TCan you name other such groups of organisms? Remember, groupsrepresent category.  Category further denotes rank.  Each rank or taxon,in fact, represents a unit of classification. These taxonomic groups/Tcategories are distinct biological entities and not merely morphologicalaggregates.Taxonomical studies of all known organisms have led to thedevelopment of common categories such as kingdom, phylum or divisionT(for plants), class, order, family, genus and species. All organisms,including those in the plant and animal kingdoms have species as thelowest category. Now the question you may ask is, how to place anorganism in various categories? The basic requirement is the knowledgeof characters of an individual or group of organisms.  This helps inTidentifying similarities and dissimilarities among the individuals of thesame kind of organisms as well as of other kinds of organisms.1.2.1SpeciesTaxonomic studies consider a group of individual organisms withfundamental similarities as a species.  One should be able to distinguishone species from the other closely related species based on the distinctmorphological differences. Let us consider Mangifera indica, Solanumtuberosum (potato) and Panthera leo (lion). All the three names, indica,tuberosum and leo, represent the specific epithets,  while the first wordsMangifera, Solanum and Panthera are genera and represents anotherhigher level of taxon or category. Each genus may have one or more thanone specific epithets representing different organisms, but havingmorphological similarities.  For example,  Panthera has another specificepithet called tigris and Solanum includes species like nigrum and2024-25THE LIVING WORLD7melongena. Human beings belong to the species sapiens  which is groupedin the genus Homo. The scientific name thus, for human being, is writtenas Homo sapiens.1.2.2GenusGenus comprises a group of related species which has more charactersin common in comparison to species of other genera. We can say thatgenera are aggregates of closely related species. For example, potato andTbrinjal are two different species but both belong to the genus Solanum.Lion (Panthera leo), leopard (P. pardus) and tiger (P. tigris) with severalcommon features, are all species of the genus Panthera. This genus differsfrom another genus Felis which includes cats.1.2.3FamilyThe next category, Family, has a group of related genera with still lessnumber of similarities as compared to genus and species.   Families areTcharacterised on the basis of both vegetative and reproductive features ofTplant species. Among plants for example, three different genera Solanum,Petunia and Datura are placed in the family Solanaceae. Among animalsfor example, genus Panthera, comprising lion, tiger, leopard is put alongwith genus, Felis (cats) in the family Felidae. Similarly, if you observe thefeatures of a cat and a dog, you will find some similarities and  someTdifferences as well. They are separated into two different families – FelidaeTand Canidae, respectively.1.2.4OrderYou have seen earlier that categories like species, genus and families arebased on a number of similar characters.   Generally, order and otherThigher taxonomic categories are identified based on the aggregates ofTcharacters.  Order being a higher category, is the assemblage of familiesTwhich exhibit a few similar characters.  The similar characters are less inTnumber as compared to different genera included in a family.  PlantTfamilies like Convolvulaceae, Solanaceae are included in the orderTPolymoniales mainly based on the floral characters. The animal order,Carnivora, includes families like Felidae and Canidae.1.2.5ClassThis category includes related orders. For example, order PrimataTcomprising monkey, gorilla and gibbon is placed in class Mammalia alongTwith order Carnivora that includes animals like tiger, cat and dog. ClassTMammalia has other orders also.1.2.6PhylumClasses comprising animals like fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds alongwith mammals constitute the next higher category called Phylum. All2024-258BIOLOGYthese, based on the common features like presence of notochordand dorsal hollow neural system, are included in phylumTChordata.  In case of plants,  classes with a few similar charactersTare assigned to a higher category called Division.1.2.7KingdomAll animals belonging to various phyla are assigned to theThighest category called Kingdom Animalia in the classificationTsystem of animals. The Kingdom Plantae, on the other hand, isdistinct, and comprises all plants from various divisions.Henceforth, we will refer to these two groups as animal andplant kingdoms.The taxonomic categories from species to kingdom have beenshown in ascending order starting with species in Figure 1.1.These are broad categories.  However, taxonomists have alsodeveloped sub-categories in this hierarchy to facilitate moresound and scientific placement of various taxa.Look at the hierarchy in Figure 1.1. Can you recall the basisof arrangement? Say, for example, as we go higher from speciesto kingdom, the number of common characteristics goes onTdecreasing. Lower the taxa, more are the characteristics that theTmembers within the taxon share. Higher the category, greater isthe difficulty of determining the relationship to other taxa at thesame level. Hence, the problem of classification becomes moreTcomplex.Table 1.1 indicates the taxonomic categories to which somecommon organisms like housefly, man, mango and wheat belong.Figure 1.1Taxonomiccategoriesshowinghierarchialarrangementin ascendingorderCommonBiologicalGenusFamilyOrderClassPhylum/Name NameDivisionManHomo sapiensHomoHominidaePrimataMammaliaChordataHouseflyMuscaMuscaMuscidaeDipteraInsectaArthropodadomesticaMangoMangiferaMangiferaAnacardiaceaeSapindalesDicotyledonaeAngiospermaeindicaWheatTriticumTriticumPoaceaePoalesMonocotyledonaeAngiospermaeaestivumTABLE 1.1  Organisms with their Taxonomic Categories2024-25THE LIVING WORLD9SUMMARYThe living world is rich in variety. Millions of plants and animals have beenidentified and described but a large number still remains unknown. Thevery range of organisms in terms of size, colour, habitat, physiological andmorphological features make us seek the defining characteristics of livingTorganisms. In order to facilitate the study of kinds and diversity of organisms,biologists have evolved certain rules and principles for identification,nomenclature and classification of organisms. The branch of knowledgedealing with these aspects is referred to as taxonomy. The taxonomic studiesTof various species of plants and animals are useful in agriculture, forestry,industry and in general for knowing our bio-resources and their diversity.The basics of taxonomy like identification, naming and classification oforganisms are universally evolved under international codes. Based on theresemblances and distinct differences, each organism is identified andTassigned a correct scientific/biological name comprising two words as perthe binomial system of nomenclature. An organism represents/occupies aplace or position in the system of classification. There are many categories/ranks and are generally referred to as taxonomic categories or taxa. All thecategories constitute a taxonomic hierarchy.EXERCISES1.Why are living organisms classified?2.Why are the classification systems changing every now and then?3.What different criteria would you choose to classify people that youmeet often?4.What do we learn from identification of individuals and populations?5.Given below is the scientific name of Mango.

    "input": "10BIOLOGYSince the dawn of civilisation, there have been many attempts to classifyliving organisms. It was done instinctively not using criteria that werescientific but borne out of a need to use organisms for our own use – forfood, shelter and clothing.  Aristotle was the earliest to attempt a moresscientific basis for classification. He used simple morphological charactersto classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animalsinto two groups, those which had red blood and those that did not.In Linnaeus' time a Two Kingdom system of classification withPlantae  and Animalia kingdoms was developed that included allplants and animals respectively. This system did not distinguish betweensthe eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organismsand photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi)organisms. Classification of organisms into plants and animals was easilysdone and was easy to understand, but, a large number of organismsdid not fall into either category. Hence the two kingdom classificationused for a long time was found inadequate.  Besides, gross morphologysa need was also felt for including other characteristics like cell structure,nature of wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction,evolutionary relationships, etc.  Classification systems for the livingsorganisms have hence, undergone several changes over the time.Though plant and animal kingdoms have been a constant under alldifferent systems, the understanding of what groups/organisms besincluded under these kingdoms have been changing; the number andnature of other kingdoms have also been understood differently bydifferent scientists over the time.BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATIONCHAPTER  22.1Kingdom Monera2.2Kingdom Protista2.3Kingdom Fungi2.4Kingdom Plantae2.5KingdomAnimalia2.6Viruses, Viroidsand Lichens2024-25BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION11R.H. Whittaker (1969) proposed a Five Kingdom Classification. Thekingdoms defined by him were named Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantaeand Animalia. The main criteria for classification used by him include cellstructure, body organisation, mode of nutrition, reproduction andphylogenetic relationships. Table 2.1 gives a comparative account of differentscharacteristics of the five kingdoms.The three-domain system has also been proposed that divides the KingdomMonera into two domains, leaving the remaining eukaryotic kingdoms in thethird domain and thereby a six kingdom classification. You will learn aboutthis system in detail at higher classes.Let us look at this five kingdom classification to understand the issuesand considerations that influenced the classification system. Earlierclassification systems included bacteria, blue green algae, fungi, mosses,sferns, gymnosperms and the angiosperms under ‘Plants’. The charactersthat unified this whole kingdom was that all the organisms included had acell wall in their cells.  This placed together groups which widely differed inother characteristics. It brought together the prokaryotic bacteria and thesblue green algae ( cyanobacteria) with other groups which were eukaryotic.It also grouped together the unicellular organisms and the multicellularones, say, for example, Chlamydomonas and Spirogyra were placed togetherunder algae. The classification did not differentiate between the heterotrophicgroup – fungi, and the autotrophic green plants, though they also showedsa characteristic difference in their walls composition – the fungi had chitinFive KingdomsCharactersCell typeCell wallNuclearmembraneBodyorganisationMode ofnutritionMoneraProkaryoticNoncellulosic(Polysaccharide+ amino acid)AbsentCellularAutotrophic(chemosyn-thetic andphotosynthetic)and Hetero-trophic (sapro-phytic/para-sitic)ProtistaEukaryoticPresent insomePresentCellularAutotrophic(Photosyn-thetic) andHetero-trophicFungiEukaryoticPresentwith chitinPresentMulticeullar/loose tissueHeterotrophic(Saprophytic/Parasitic)PlantaeEukaryoticPresent(cellulose)PresentTissue/organsAutotrophic(Photosyn-thetic)AnimaliaEukaryoticAbsentPresentTissue/organ/organ systemsHeterotrophic(Holozoic/Saprophyticsetc.)TABLE 2.1  Characteristics of the Five Kingdoms2024-2512BIOLOGYin their walls while the green plants had a cellulosic cell wall.  When suchcharacteristics were considered, the fungi were placed in a separatekingdom – Kingdom Fungi. All prokaryotic organisms were groupedstogether under Kingdom Monera and the unicellular eukaryotic organismswere placed in Kingdom Protista. Kingdom Protista has brought togetherChlamydomonas, Chlorella (earlier placed in Algae within Plants and bothhaving cell walls) with Paramoecium and Amoeba (which were earlier placedin the animal kingdom which lack cell wall). It has put together organismsswhich, in earlier classifications, were placed in different kingdoms.  Thisshappened because the criteria for classification changed. This kind ofchanges will take place in future too depending on the improvement in ourunderstanding of characteristics and evolutionary relationships. Over time,san attempt has been made to evolve a classification system which reflectsnot only the morphological, physiological and reproductive similarities,but is also phylogenetic, i.e., is based on  evolutionary relationships.In this chapter we will study characteristics of Kingdoms Monera,Protista and Fungi of the Whittaker system of classification.  The KingdomssPlantae and Animalia, commonly referred to as plant and animalskingdoms, respectively, will be dealt separately in chapters 3 and 4.SporeFlagellumCocciBacilliSpirillaVibrioFigure 2.1 Bacteria of different shapes2.1KINGDOM MONERABacteria are the sole members of the Kingdom Monera. They are the mostsabundant micro-organisms. Bacteria occur almost everywhere. Hundredsof bacteria are present in a handful of soil. They also live in extreme habitatssuch as hot springs, deserts, snow and deep oceans where very few otherslife forms can survive. Many of them live in or on other organisms asparasites.Bacteria are grouped under four categories based on their shape: thespherical Coccus (pl.: cocci), the rod-shaped Bacillus (pl.: bacilli), thescomma-shaped Vibrium (pl.: vibrio) and the spiral Spirillum (pl.: spirilla)(Figure 2.1).2024-25BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION13Though the bacterial structure is very simple, they are very complexin behaviour. Compared to many other organisms, bacteria as a groupshow the most extensive metabolic diversity. Some of the bacteria areautotrophic, i.e., they synthesise their own food from inorganic substrates.They may be photosynthetic autotrophic or chemosynthetic autotrophic.The vast majority of bacteria are heterotrophs, i.e., they depend on othersorganisms or on dead organic matter for food.2.1.1ArchaebacteriaThese bacteria are special since they live in some of the most harsh habitatsssuch as extreme salty areas (halophiles), hot springs (thermoacidophiles)and marshy areas (methanogens). Archaebacteria differ from other bacteriain having a different cell wall structure and this feature is responsible forstheir survival in extreme conditions. Methanogens are present in the gutof several ruminant animals such as cows and buffaloes and they areresponsible for the production of methane (biogas) from the dung of thesesanimals.Figure 2.2A filamentous blue-greenalgae – Nostoc2.1.2EubacteriaThere are thousands of different eubacteria or ‘truebacteria’. They are characterised by the presence of arigid cell wall, and if motile, a flagellum. Thecyanobacteria (also referred to as blue-green algae)have chlorophyll a similar to green plants and arephotosynthetic autotrophs (Figure 2.2). Thecyanobacteria are unicellular, colonial or filamentous,freshwater/marine or terrestrial algae. The coloniesare generally surrounded by gelatinous sheath. Theyoften form blooms in polluted water bodies. Some ofthese organisms can fix atmospheric nitrogen insspecialised cells called heterocysts, e.g., Nostoc andAnabaena. Chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteriaoxidise various inorganic substances such assnitrates, nitrites and ammonia and use the releasedenergy for their ATP production. They play a great rolein recycling nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous,siron and sulphur.Heterotrophic bacteria are most abundant innature. The majority are important decomposers.sMany of them have a significant impact on humanaffairs. They are helpful in making curd from milk,production  of antibiotics, fixing nitrogen in legume2024-2514BIOLOGYroots, etc. Some are pathogens causing damageto human beings, crops, farm animals and pets.Cholera, typhoid, tetanus, citrus canker are wellknown diseases  caused by different bacteria.Bacteria reproduce mainly by fission (Figure2.3). Sometimes, under unfavourable conditions,they produce spores. They also reproduce by asort of sexual reproduction by adopting aprimitive type of DNA transfer from one bacteriumto the other.The Mycoplasma are organisms thatcompletely lack a cell wall. They are the smallestliving cells known and can survive without oxygen. Many mycoplasmasare pathogenic in animals and plants.2.2KINGDOM PROTISTAAll single-celled eukaryotes are placed under Protista, but the boundariesof this kingdom are not well defined. What may be ‘a photosyntheticsprotistan’ to one biologist may be ‘a plant’ to another. In this book weinclude Chrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime moulds andProtozoans under Protista. Members of Protista are primarily aquatic.This kingdom forms a link with the others dealing with plants, animalsand fungi. Being eukaryotes, the protistan cell body contains a well definednucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Some have flagella orcilia. Protists reproduce asexually and sexually by a process involvingcell fusion and zygote formation.2.2.1ChrysophytesThis group includes diatoms and golden algae (desmids). They are foundin fresh water as well as in marine environments. They are microscopicand float passively in water currents (plankton). Most of them arephotosynthetic. In diatoms the cell walls form two thin overlapping shells,which fit together as in a soap box. The walls are embedded with silicaand thus the walls are indestructible. Thus, diatoms have left behindlarge amount of cell wall deposits in their habitat; this accumulation overbillions of years is referred to as ‘diatomaceous earth’. Being gritty thissoil is used in polishing, filtration of oils and syrups. Diatoms are thechief ‘producers’ in the oceans.Figure 2.3 A dividing bacterium2024-25BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION152.2.2DinoflagellatesThese organisms are mostly marine and photosynthetic.They appear yellow, green, brown, blue or red dependingson the main pigments present in their cells. The cell wallhas stiff cellulose plates on the outer surface. Most ofthem have two flagella; one lies longitudinally and thesother transversely in a furrow between the wall plates.Very often, red dinoflagellates (Example: Gonyaulax)undergo such rapid multiplication that they make thesea appear red (red tides). Toxins released by such largenumbers may even kill other marine animals such asfishes.2.2.3EuglenoidsMajority of them are fresh water organisms found instagnant water. Instead of a cell wall, they have a proteinrich layer called pellicle which makes their body flexible.They have two flagella, a short and a long one. Thoughsthey are photosynthetic in the presence of sunlight, whendeprived of sunlight they behave like heterotrophs bypredating on other smaller organisms. Interestingly, thespigments of euglenoids are identical to those present inshigher plants. Example: Euglena (Figure 2.4b).2.2.4Slime MouldsSlime moulds are saprophytic protists. The body movesalong decaying twigs and leaves engulfing organicmaterial. Under suitable conditions, they form ansaggregation called plasmodium which may grow andspread over several feet. During unfavourable conditions,the plasmodium differentiates and forms fruiting bodiessbearing spores at their tips. The spores possess true walls.They are extremely resistant and survive for many years,even under adverse conditions. The spores are dispersedsby air currents.2.2.5ProtozoansAll protozoans are heterotrophs and live as predators orsparasites. They are believed to be primitive relatives ofanimals. There are four major groups of protozoans.Amoeboid protozoans: These organisms live in freshwater, sea water or moist soil. They move and captureFigure 2.4(a) Dinoflagellates(b) Euglena(c) Slime mould(d) Paramoecium(d)(a)(c)(b)2024-2516BIOLOGYtheir prey by putting out pseudopodia (false feet) as in Amoeba. Marineforms have silica shells on their surface. Some of them such as Entamoebaare parasites.Flagellated protozoans: The members of this group are either free-livingor parasitic. They have flagella. The parasitic forms cause diaseases suchas sleeping sickness. Example: Trypanosoma.Ciliated protozoans: These are aquatic, actively moving organisms becauseof the presence of thousands of cilia. They have a cavity (gullet) that openssto the outside of the cell surface. The coordinated movement of rows ofcilia causes the water laden with food to be steered into the gullet. Example:Paramoecium (Figure 2.4d).Sporozoans: This includes diverse organisms that have an infectiousspore-like stage in their life cycle. The most notorious is Plasmodium(malarial parasite) which causes malaria, a disease which has a staggeringeffect on human population.2.3KINGDOM FUNGIThe fungi constitute a unique kingdom of heterotrophic organisms. Theyshow a great diversity in morphology and habitat. You  must have seenfungi on a moist bread and rotten fruits. The common mushroom you eatand toadstools are also fungi. White spots seen on mustard leaves are duesto a parasitic fungus. Some unicellular fungi, e.g., yeast are used to makesbread and beer. Other fungi cause diseases in plants and animals; wheatrust-causing Puccinia is an important example. Some are the source ofantibiotics, e.g., Penicillium. Fungi are cosmopolitan and occur in air, water,soil and on animals and plants.  They prefer to grow in warm and humidplaces. Have you ever wondered why we keep food in the refrigerator ? Yes,it is to prevent food from going bad due to bacterial or fungal infections.With the exception of yeasts which are unicellular, fungi arefilamentous. Their bodies consist of long, slender thread-like structurescalled hyphae. The network of hyphae is known as mycelium. Some hyphaesare continuous tubes filled with multinucleated cytoplasm – these arecalled coenocytic hyphae. Others have septae or cross walls in theirhyphae. The cell walls of fungi are composed of chitin and polysaccharides.Most fungi are heterotrophic and absorb soluble organic matter fromdead substrates and hence are  called saprophytes. Those that dependon living plants and animals are called parasites. They can also live assymbionts – in association with algae as lichens and with roots of higherplants as mycorrhiza.Reproduction in fungi can take place by vegetative means –fragmentation, fission and budding. Asexual reproduction is by spores2024-25BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION17called conidia or sporangiospores or zoospores, and sexual reproductionis by oospores, ascospores and basidiospores. The various spores areproduced in distinct structures called fruiting bodies. The sexual cyclesinvolves the following  three steps:(i)Fusion of protoplasms between two motile or non-motile gametescalled plasmogamy.(ii)Fusion of two nuclei called karyogamy.(iii)Meiosis in zygote resulting in haploid spores.When a fungus reproduces sexually, two haploidhyphae of compatible mating types come together andfuse. In some fungi the fusion of two haploid cellsimmediately results in diploid cells (2n). However, in otherfungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes), an interveningdikaryotic stage (n + n, i.e., two nuclei per cell) occurs;such a condition is called a dikaryon and the phase iscalled dikaryophase of fungus. Later, the parental nucleifuse and the cells become diploid.  The fungi form fruitingsbodies in which reduction division occurs, leading toformation of haploid spores.The morphology of the mycelium, mode of sporeformation and fruiting bodies  form the basis for thesdivision of the kingdom  into various classes.2.3.1PhycomycetesMembers of phycomycetes are found in aquatic habitatsand on decaying wood in moist and damp places or asobligate parasites on plants. The mycelium is aseptatesand coenocytic. Asexual reproduction takes place byszoospores (motile) or by aplanospores (non-motile). Thesespores are endogenously produced in sporangium. Azygospore is formed by fusion of two gametes. Thesesgametes are similar in morphology (isogamous) orsdissimilar (anisogamous or oogamous). Some commonexamples are Mucor (Figure 2.5a), Rhizopus (the breadmould mentioned earlier) and Albugo (the parasitic fungion mustard).2.3.2AscomycetesCommonly known as sac-fungi, the ascomycetes  are mostlymulticellular, e.g., Penicillium, or rarely unicellular, e.g., yeast(Saccharomyces). They are saprophytic, decomposers,parasitic or coprophilous (growing on dung). MyceliumFigure 2.5Fungi: (a) Mucor(b) Aspergillus (c) Agaricus(c)(a)(b)2024-2518BIOLOGYis branched and septate. The asexual spores are conidia producedexogenously on the special mycelium called conidiophores. Conidia ongermination produce mycelium. Sexual spores are called ascosporeswhich are produced endogenously in sac like asci (singular ascus). Theseasci are arranged in different types of fruiting bodies called ascocarps.Some examples are Aspergillus (Figure 2.5b), Claviceps and Neurospora.Neurospora  is used extensively in biochemical and genetic work. Manymembers like morels and truffles are edible and are considered  delicacies.2.3.3BasidiomycetesCommonly known forms of basidiomycetes are mushrooms, bracket fungior puffballs. They grow in soil, on logs and tree stumps and in livingplant bodies as parasites, e.g., rusts and smuts. The mycelium is branchedand septate. The asexual spores are generally not found, but vegetativereproduction by fragmentation is common. The sex organs are absent,but plasmogamy is brought about by fusion of two vegetative or somaticcells of different strains or genotypes. The resultant structure is dikaryoticwhich ultimately gives rise to basidium. Karyogamy and meiosis takeplace in the basidium producing four basidiospores. The basidiosporesare exogenously produced on the basidium (pl.: basidia). The basidia arearranged in fruiting bodies called basidiocarps. Some common membersare Agaricus (mushroom) (Figure 2.5c), Ustilago (smut) and Puccinia (rustfungus).2.3.4DeuteromycetesCommonly known as imperfect fungi because only the asexual orsvegetative phases of these fungi are known.  When the sexual forms ofthese fungi were discovered they were moved into classes they rightlybelong to.  It is also possible that the asexual and vegetative stage havebeen given one name (and placed under deuteromycetes) and the sexualstage another (and placed under another class).  Later when the linkageswere established, the fungi were correctly identified and moved out ofdeuteromycetes. Once perfect (sexual) stages of members ofdueteromycetes were discovered they were often moved to ascomycetesand basidiomycetes. The deuteromycetes reproduce only by asexual sporesknown as conidia. The mycelium is septate and branched. Some membersare saprophytes or parasites while a large number of them aredecomposers of litter and help in mineral cycling. Some examples areAlternaria, Colletotrichum and Trichoderma.2024-25BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION192.4KINGDOM PLANTAEKingdom Plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containingorganisms commonly called plants. A few members are partiallysheterotrophic such as the insectivorous plants or parasites. Bladderwortand Venus fly trap are examples of insectivorous plants and Cuscuta is aparasite. The plant cells have an eukaryotic structure with prominentchloroplasts and cell wall mainly made of cellulose. You will study theeukaryotic cell structure in detail in Chapter 8. Plantae includes algae,sbryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms.Life cycle of plants has two distinct phases – the diploid sporophyticand the haploid gametophytic – that alternate with each other. The lengthsof the haploid and diploid phases, and whether these phases are free–sliving or dependent on others, vary among different groups in plants.This phenomenon is called alternation of generation. You will studyfurther details of this kingdom in Chapter3.2.5KINGDOM ANIMALIAThis kingdom is characterised by heterotrophic eukaryotic organismsthat are multicellular and their cells lack cell walls. They directly orsindirectly depend on plants for food. They digest their food in an internalcavity and store food reserves as glycogen or fat. Their mode of nutritionis holozoic – by ingestion of food. They follow a definite growth patternsand grow into adults that have a definite shape and size. Higher formsshow elaborate sensory and neuromotor mechanism. Most of them arecapable of locomotion.The sexual reproduction is by copulation of male and female followedby embryological development. Salient features of various phyla aresdescribed in Chapter 4.2.6VIRUSES, VIROIDS, PRIONS AND LICHENSIn the five kingdom classification of Whittaker there is no mention of lichenssand some acellular organisms like viruses, viroids and prions. These aresbriefly introduced here.All of us who have suffered the ill effects of common cold or ‘flu’ knowwhat effects viruses can have on us, even if we do not associate it with ourscondition. Viruses did not find a place in classification since they are notconsidered truly ‘living’, if we understand living as those organisms thathave a cell structure.  The viruses are non-cellular organisms that arescharacterised by having an inert crystalline structure outside the living cell.2024-2520BIOLOGYOnce they infect a cell they take over the machinery of the host cell to replicatethemselves, killing the host. Would you call viruses living or non-living?Virus means venom or poisonous fluid. Dmitri Ivanowsky (1892)recognised certain microbes as causal organism of the mosaic disease oftobacco (Figure 2.6a). These were found to be smaller than bacteriabecause they passed through bacteria-proof filters. M.W. Beijerinek(1898) demonstrated that the extract of the infected plants of  tobaccoscould cause infection in healthy plants and named the new pathogen“virus” and called the fluid as Contagium vivum fluidum (infectious livingfluid).  W.M. Stanley (1935) showed that viruses could be crystallisedand crystals consist largely of proteins. They are inert outside their specifichost cell. Viruses are obligate parasites.In addition to proteins, viruses also contain genetic material, that couldbe either RNA or DNA.  No virus contains both RNA and DNA.  A virus issa nucleoprotein and the genetic material is infectious. In general, virusesthat infect plants have single stranded RNA and viruses that infect animalshave either single or double stranded RNA or double stranded DNA.Bacterial viruses or bacteriophages (viruses that infect the bacteria) areusually double stranded DNA viruses (Figure 2.6b). The protein coatcalled capsid made of small subunits called capsomeres, protects thenucleic acid. These capsomeres are arranged in helical or polyhedralsgeometric forms. Viruses cause diseases like  mumps, small pox, herpesand influenza. AIDS in humans is also caused by a virus. In plants, thesymptoms can be mosaic formation, leaf rolling and curling, yellowingand vein clearing, dwarfing  and stunted growth.RNACapsid V­SheathHeadTail fibresCollar(b)Figure 2.6  (a) Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)  (b) Bacteriophage2024-25BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION21SUMMARYBiological classification of plants and animals was first proposed by Aristotle on thebasis of simple morphological characters. Linnaeus later classified all living organismssinto two kingdoms – Plantae and Animalia. Whittaker proposed an elaborate fivekingdom classification – Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia. The maincriteria of the five kingdom classification were cell structure, body organisation,smode of nutrition and reproduction, and phylogenetic relationships.In the five kingdom classification, bacteria are included in Kingdom Monera.Bacteria are cosmopolitan in distribution. These organisms show the most extensivesmetabolic diversity. Bacteria may be autotrophic or heterotrophic in their mode ofnutrition. Kingdom Protista includes all single-celled eukaryotes such asChrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime-moulds and Protozoans. Protistsshave defined nucleus and other membrane bound organelles. They reproduceboth asexually and sexually. Members of Kingdom Fungi show a great diversityin structures and habitat. Most fungi are saprophytic in their mode of nutrition.sThey show asexual and sexual reproduction. Phycomycetes, Ascomycetes,Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes are the four classes under this kingdom.The plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing organisms. Algae,sbryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms are included in thisgroup. The life cycle of plants exhibit alternation of generations – gametophyticand sporophytic generations. The heterotrophic eukaryotic, multicellularsorganisms lacking a cell wall are included in the Kingdom Animalia. The mode ofnutrition of these organisms is holozoic. They reproduce mostly by the sexualmode. Some acellular organisms like viruses and viroids as well as the lichens aresnot included in the five kingdom system of classification.Viroids : In 1971, T.O. Diener discovered a new infectious agent thatwas smaller than viruses and caused potato spindle tuber disease. It wasfound to be a free RNA; it lacked the protein coat that is found in viruses,shence the name viroid. The RNA of the viroid was of low molecular weight.Prions : In modern medicine certain infectious neurological diseaseswere found to be transmitted by an agent consisting of abnormally foldedsprotein. The agent was similar in size to viruses. These agents were calledprions. The most notable diseases caused by prions are bovine spongiformencephalopathy (BSE) commonly called   mad cow disease in cattle andits analogous variant Cr–Jacob disease (CJD) in humans.LLichens : Lichens are symbiotic associations i.e. mutually usefulassociations, between algae and fungi. The algal component is known asLphycobiont and fungal component as mycobiont, which are autotrophicand heterotrophic, respectively. Algae prepare food for fungi and fungisprovide shelter and absorb mineral nutrients and water for its partner.So close is their association that if one saw a lichen in nature one wouldnever imagine that they had two different organisms within them.  Lichensare very good pollution indicators – they do not grow in polluted areas.2024-2522BIOLOGYEXERCISES1.Discuss how classification systems have undergone several changes over aperiod of time?2.State two economically important uses of:(a) heterotrophic bacterias(b) archaebacteria3.What is the nature of cell-walls in diatoms?4.Find out what do the terms ‘algal bloom’ and ‘red-tides’ signify.5.How are viroids different from viruses?6.Describe briefly the four major groups of Protozoa.7.Plants are autotrophic.

    "input": "PLANT KINGDOM23In the previous chapter, we looked at the broad classification of livingorganisms under the system proposed by Whittaker (1969) wherein hesuggested the Five Kingdom classification viz. Monera, Protista, Fungi,Animalia and Plantae.  In this chapter, we will deal in detail with furtheruclassification within Kingdom Plantae popularly known as the ‘plantkingdom’.We must stress here that our understanding of the plant kingdomhas changed over time. Fungi, and members of the Monera and Protistauhaving cell walls have now been excluded from Plantae though earlierclassifications placed them in the same kingdom.  So, the cyanobacteriauthat are also referred to as blue green algae are not ‘algae’ any more.  Inthis chapter, we will describe Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes,Gymnosperms and Angiosperms under Plantae .Let us also look at classification within angiosperms to understandsome of the concerns  that influenced the classification systems. Theearliest systems of classification used only gross superficial morphologicalucharacters such as habit, colour, number and shape of leaves, etc.  Theywere based mainly on vegetative characters or on the androeciumstructure (system given by Linnaeus). Such systems were artificial; theyseparated the closely related species since they were based on a fewcharacteristics. Also, the artificial systems gave equal weightage tovegetative and sexual characteristics; this is not acceptable since we knowuthat often the vegetative characters are more easily affected byenvironment. As against this, natural classification systems developed,which were based on natural affinities among the organisms and consider,PLANT KINGDOMCHAPTER  33.1Algae3.2Bryophytes3.3Pteridophytes3.4Gymnosperms3.5Angiosperms2024-2524BIOLOGYnot only the external features, but also internal features, like ultra-structure, anatomy, embryology and phytochemistry. Such auclassification for flowering plants was given by George Bentham andJoseph Dalton Hooker.At present phylogenetic classification systems based onevolutionary relationships between the various organisms are acceptable.uThis assumes that organisms belonging to the same taxa have a commonancestor.   We now use information from many other sources too to helpresolve difficulties in classification.  These become more important whenthere is no supporting fossil evidence.  Numerical Taxonomy which isnow easily carried out using computers is based on all observablecharacteristics. Number and codes are assigned to all the characters anduthe data are then processed. In this way each character is given equalimportance and at the same time hundreds of characters can beuconsidered.  Cytotaxonomy that is based on cytological information likechromosome number, structure, behaviour and chemotaxonomy thatuses the chemical constituents of the plant to resolve confusions, are alsouused by taxonomists these days.3.1ALGAEAlgae are chlorophyll-bearing, simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largelyuaquatic (both fresh water and marine) organisms. They occur in avariety of other habitats: moist stones, soils and wood. Some of themalso occur in association with fungi (lichen) and animals (e.g., on slothubear).The form and size of algae is highly variable, ranging from colonialforms like Volvox and the filamentous forms like Ulothrix and Spirogyra(Figure 3.1). A few of the marine forms such as kelps, form massive plantbodies.The algae reproduce by vegetative, asexual and sexual methods.Vegetative reproduction is by fragmentation. Each fragment develops intoa thallus. Asexual reproduction is by the production of different types ofuspores, the most common being the zoospores. They are flagellated(motile) and on germination gives rise to new plants. Sexual reproductiontakes place through fusion of two gametes. These gametes can beflagellated and similar in size (as in Ulothrix) or non-flagellated (non-motile)but similar in size (as in Spirogyra). Such reproduction is calledisogamous. Fusion of two gametes dissimilar in size, as in species ofEudorina is termed as anisogamous. Fusion between one large, non-motile (static) female gamete and a smaller, motile male gamete is termedoogamous, e.g., Volvox, Fucus.2024-25PLANT KINGDOM25Figure 3.1  Algae :(a) Green algae   (i) Volvox         (ii) Ulothrix(b) Brown algae  (i) Laminaria   (ii) Fucus      (iii) Dictyota(c)  Red algae     (i)  Porphyra    (ii) Polysiphonia2024-2526BIOLOGYAlgae are useful to man in a variety of ways. At least a half of the totalcarbon dioxide fixation on earth is carried out by algae throughphotosynthesis. Being photosynthetic they increase the level of dissolveduoxygen in their immediate environment. They are of paramountimportance as primary producers of energy-rich compounds which formthe basis of the food cycles of all aquatic animals. Many species of Porphyra,Laminaria and Sargassum  are among the 70 species of marine algaeused as food. Certain marine brown and red algae produce large amountsuof hydrocolloids (water holding substances), e.g., algin (brown algae) andcarrageen (red algae) which are used commercially. Agar, one of thecommercial products obtained from Gelidium and Gracilaria are used togrow microbes and in preparations of ice-creams and jellies. Chlorella aunicellular alga rich in proteins is used as food supplement even by spacetravellers. The algae are divided into three main classes: Chlorophyceae,Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae.3.1.1ChlorophyceaeThe members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. Theplant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous. They are usuallygrass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. Thepigments are localised in definite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may bediscoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped inudifferent species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodiescalled pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain proteinbesides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets.uGreen algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of celluloseand an outer layer of pectose.Vegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or byformation of different types of spores. Asexual reproduction is byuflagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia. The sexual reproductionshows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and itumay be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Some commonly foundgreen algae are: Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and Chara(Figure 3.1a).3.1.2PhaeophyceaeThe members of phaeophyceae or brown algae are found primarily inmarine habitats. They show great variation in size and form. They rangefrom simple branched, filamentous forms (Ectocarpus) to profuselybranched forms as represented by kelps, which may reach a height ofu100 metres. They possess chlorophyll a, c, carotenoids and xanthophylls.They vary in colour from olive green to various shades of brown dependingupon the amount of the xanthophyll pigment, fucoxanthin present in2024-25PLANT KINGDOM27them. Food is stored as complex carbohydrates, which may be in theform of laminarin or mannitol. The vegetative cells have a cellulosic wallusually covered on the outside by a gelatinous coating of algin. Theprotoplast contains, in addition to plastids, a centrally located vacuoleand nucleus. The plant body is usually attached to the substratum by aholdfast, and has a stalk, the stipe and leaf like photosynthetic organ –the frond. Vegetative reproduction takes place by fragmentation. Asexualreproduction in most brown algae is by biflagellate zoospores that arepear-shaped and have two unequal laterally attached flagella.Sexual reproduction may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous.Union of gametes may take place in water or within the oogoniumu(oogamous species). The gametes are pyriform (pear-shaped) and bearutwo laterally attached flagella. The common forms are Ectocarpus, Dictyota,Laminaria, Sargassum and Fucus (Figure 3.1b).3.1.3RhodophyceaeThe members of rhodophyceae are commonly called red algae because ofthe predominance of the red pigment, r-phycoerythrin in their body. Majorityof the red algae are marine with greater concentrations found in the warmeruareas. They occur in both well-lighted regions close to the surface of waterand also at great depths in oceans where relatively little light penetrates.The red thalli of most of the red algae are  multicellular. Some of themhave complex body organisation. The food is stored as floridean starchuwhich is very similar to amylopectin and glycogen in structure.The red algae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation. Theyreproduce asexually by non-motile spores and sexually by non-motileTABLE 3.1 Divisions of Algae and their Main CharacteristicsClassesCommonMajorStoredCell WallFlagellarHabitatNamePigmentsFoodNumber andPosition ofInsertionsChlorophyceaeGreenChlorophyllStarchCellulose2-8, equal,Fresh water,algaea, bapicalbrackish water,salt waterPhaeophyceaeBrownChlorophyllMannitol,Cellulose2, unequal,Fresh wateralgaea, c,laminarinand alginlateral(rare) brackishfucoxanthinwater, saltwaterRhodophyceaeRedChlorophyllFlorideanCellulose,AbsentFresh wateralgaea, d,starchpectin and(some),phycoerythrinpolybrackishsulphatewater, saltesterswater (most)2024-2528BIOLOGYgametes.

They usually occur in damp, humid and shaded localities.uThey play an important role in plant succession on bare rocks/soil.The plant body of bryophytes is more differentiated than that of algae.It is thallus-like and prostrate or erect, and attached to the substratumuby unicellular or multicellular rhizoids. They lack true roots, stem orleaves. They may possess root-like, leaf-like or stem-like structures. Themain plant body of the bryophyte is haploid. It produces gametes, henceuis called a gametophyte. The sex organs in bryophytes are multicellular.The male sex organ is called antheridium. They produce biflagellateantherozoids. The female sex organ called archegonium is flask-shapedand produces a single egg. The antherozoids are released into water wherethey come in contact with archegonium. An antherozoid fuses with theegg to produce the zygote. Zygotes do not undergo reduction divisionuimmediately. They produce a multicellular body called a sporophyte.The sporophyte is not free-living but attached to the photosyntheticugametophyte and derives nourishment from it. Some cells of theusporophyte undergo reduction division (meiosis) to produce haploidspores.  These spores germinate to produce gametophyte.Bryophytes in general are of little economic importance but somemosses provide food for herbaceous mammals, birds and other animals.uSpecies of Sphagnum, a moss, provide peat that have long been used asfuel,  and as packing material for trans-shipment of living material becauseof their capacity to hold water. Mosses along with lichens are the firstorganisms to colonise rocks and hence, are of great ecological importance.They decompose rocks making the substrate suitable for the growth ofuhigher plants. Since mosses form dense mats on the soil, they reduce theimpact of falling rain and prevent soil erosion. The bryophytes are dividedinto liverworts and mosses.3.2.1LiverwortsThe liverworts grow usually in moist, shady habitats such as banks ofustreams, marshy ground, damp soil, bark of trees and deep in the woods.uThe plant body of a liverwort is thalloid, e.g., Marchantia. The thallus isdorsiventral and closely appressed to the substrate. The leafy membersuhave tiny leaf-like appendages in two rows on the stem-like structures.Asexual reproduction in liverworts takes place by fragmentation ofthalli, or by the formation of specialised structures called gemmae(sing. gemma). Gemmae are green, multicellular, asexual buds, whichdevelop in small receptacles  called gemma cups located on the thalli.The gemmae become detached from the parent body and germinate toform new individuals. During sexual reproduction, male and female sex2024-2530BIOLOGYorgans are produced either on the same or on different thalli. Thesporophyte is differentiated into a foot, seta and capsule. After meiosis,spores are produced within the capsule. These spores germinate to formufree-living gametophytes.3.2.2MossesThe predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte whichuconsists of two stages. The first stage is the protonema stage, whichdevelops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched andufrequently filamentous stage. The second stage is the leafy stage, whichdevelops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. They consist ofupright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. They are attachedto the soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bearsuthe sex organs.Vegetative reproduction in mosses is by fragmentation and buddingin the secondary protonema. In sexual reproduction, the sex organsuantheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots.After fertilisation, the zygote develops into a sporophyte, consisting of afoot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate thanuthat in liverworts. The capsule contains spores. Spores are formed aftermeiosis. The mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal.Common examples of mosses are Funaria, Polytrichum and Sphagnum(Figure 3.2).3.3PTERIDOPHYTESThe Pteridophytes include horsetails and ferns. Pteridophytes are usedufor medicinal purposes and as soil-binders. They are also frequently grownas ornamentals. Evolutionarily, they are the first terrestrial plants topossess vascular tissues – xylem and phloem. You shall study more aboutthese tissues in Chapter 6. The pteridophytes are found in cool, damp,shady places though some may flourish well in sandy-soil conditions.You may recall that in bryophytes the dominant phase in the lifecycle is the gametophytic plant body. However, in pteridophytes, theumain plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root,stem and leaves (Figure 3.3). These organs possess well-differentiateduvascular tissues. The leaves in pteridophyta are small (microphylls) asin Selaginella or large (macrophylls) as in ferns. The sporophytes bearsporangia that are subtended by leaf-like appendages calledsporophylls. In some cases sporophylls may form distinct compactstructures called strobili or cones (Selaginella, Equisetum). Thesporangia produce spores by meiosis in spore mother cells. The sporesugerminate to give rise to inconspicuous, small but multicellular,2024-25PLANT KINGDOM31Figure 3.3  Pteridophytes :  (a) Selaginella  (b) Equisetum  (c) Fern (d) SalviniaStrobilusNodeInternodeBranchRhizome(b)(c)(d)2024-2532BIOLOGYfree-living, mostly photosynthetic thalloid gametophytes calledprothallus. These gametophytes require cool, damp, shady places togrow. Because of this specific restricted requirement and the need forwater for fertilisation, the spread of living pteridophytes is limited andrestricted to narrow geographical regions. The gametophytes bear maleand female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia, respectively.Water is required for transfer of antherozoids – the male gametes releasedfrom the antheridia, to the mouth of archegonium. Fusion of male gameteuwith the egg present in the archegonium result in the formation of zygote.uZygote thereafter produces a multicellular well-differentiated sporophytewhich is the dominant phase of the pteridophytes. In majority of thepteridophytes all the spores are of similar kinds; such plants are calledNhomosporous. Genera like Selaginella and Salvinia which producetwo kinds of spores, macro (large) and micro (small) spores, are knownuas heterosporous. The megaspores and microspores germinate and giverise to female and male gametophytes, respectively. The femalegametophytes in these plants are retained on the parent sporophytesfor variable periods. The development of the zygotes into young embryostake place within the female gametophytes. This event is a precursor tothe seed habit considered an important step in evolution.The pteridophytes are further classified into four classes: Psilopsida(Psilotum); Lycopsida (Selaginella, Lycopodium), Sphenopsida (Equisetum)and Pteropsida (Dryopteris, Pteris, Adiantum).3.4GYMNOSPERMSThe gymnosperms (gymnos : naked, sperma : seeds) are plants in whichthe ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall and remain exposed, bothubefore and after fertilisation. The seeds that develop post-fertilisation, areunot covered, i.e., are naked. Gymnosperms include medium-sized treesor tall trees and shrubs (Figure 3.4). One of the gymnosperms, the giantredwood tree Sequoia is one of the tallest tree species. The roots aregenerally tap roots. Roots in some genera have fungal association in theform of mycorrhiza (Pinus), while in some others (Cycas) small specialisedroots called coralloid roots are associated with N2- fixing cyanobacteria.The stems are unbranched (Cycas) or branched (Pinus, Cedrus). The leavesmay be simple or compound. In Cycas the pinnate leaves persist for a fewyears. The leaves in gymnosperms are well-adapted to withstand extremesof temperature, humidity and wind. In conifers, the needle-like leavesreduce the surface area. Their thick cuticle and sunken stomata alsohelp to reduce water loss.2024-25PLANT KINGDOM33The gymnosperms are heterosporous; they producehaploid microspores and megaspores. The two kinds ofspores are produced within sporangia that are borneuon sporophylls which are arranged spirally along an axisto form lax or compact strobili or cones. The strobilibearing microsporophylls and microsporangia arecalled microsporangiate or male strobili. Themicrospores develop into a male gametophyticgeneration which is highly reduced and is confined touonly a limited number of cells. This reducedgametophyte is called a pollen grain. The developmentof pollen grains take place within the microsporangia.The cones bearing megasporophylls with ovules ormegasporangia are called macrosporangiate or femalestrobili. The male or female cones or strobili may beborne on the same tree (Pinus). However, in cycas malecones and megasporophylls are borne on different trees.The megaspore mother cell is differentiated from one ofuthe cells of the nucellus. The nucellus is protected byenvelopes and the composite structure is called anovule. The ovules are borne on megasporophylls whichmay be clustered to form the female cones. Themegaspore mother cell divides meiotically to form fourmegaspores. One of the megaspores enclosed within theNmegasporangium develops into a multicellular  femalegametophyte that bears two or more archegonia orfemale sex organs. The multicellular female gametophyteuis also retained within megasporangium.Unlike bryophytes and pteridophytes, ingymnosperms the male and the female gametophytesudo not have an independent free-living existence. Theyremain within the sporangia retained on thesporophytes. The pollen grain is released from theumicrosporangium. They are carried in air currents andcome in contact with the opening of the ovules borneon megasporophylls. The pollen tube carrying theumale gametes grows towards archegonia in the ovulesand discharge their contents near the mouth of thearchegonia. Following fertilisation, zygote developsuinto an embryo and the ovules into seeds. These seedsare not covered.(c)Figure 3.4Gymnosperms: (a) Cycas(b) Pinus (c) GinkgoDwarf ShootLong ShootSeeds(b)(a)2024-2534BIOLOGY3.5ANGIOSPERMSUnlike the gymnosperms where the ovules are naked, in the angiospermsor flowering plants, the pollen grains and ovules are developed inuspecialised structures called flowers. In angiosperms, the seeds areenclosed in fruits. The angiosperms are an exceptionally large group ofuplants occurring in wide range of habitats. They range in size from theusmallest Wolffia to tall trees of Eucalyptus (over 100 metres). They provideus with food, fodder,  fuel, medicines and several other commerciallyimportant products. They are divided into two classes : the dicotyledonsand the monocotyledons (Figure 3.5).SUMMARYPlant kingdom includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnospermsuand angiosperms. Algae are chlorophyll-bearing simple, thalloid,uautotrophic and largely aquatic organisms. Depending on the type ofpigment possesed and the type of stored food, algae are classfied intothree classes, namely Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae.uAlgae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation, asexually byformation of different types of spores and sexually by formation of gameteswhich may show isogamy, anisogamy or oogamy.Bryophytes are plants which can live in soil but are dependent onwater for sexual reproduction. Their plant body is more differentiateduthan that of algae. It is thallus-like and prostrate or erect and attached touthe substratum by rhizoids. They possess root-like, leaf-like and stem-(b)(a)Figure 3.5Angiosperms : (a) A dicotyledon (b) A monocotyledon2024-25PLANT KINGDOM35like structures. The bryophytes are divided into liverworts and mosses.The plant body of liverworts is thalloid and dorsiventral whereas mosseshave upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. The mainuplant body of a bryophyte is gamete-producing and is called agametophyte. It bears the male sex organs called antheridia  and femalesex organs called archegonia. The male and female gametes producedufuse to form zygote which produces a multicellular body called asporophyte. It produces haploid spores. The spores germinate to formgametophytes.In pteridophytes the main plant is a sporophyte which is differentiatedinto true root, stem and leaves. These organs possess well-differentiateduvascular tissues. The sporophytes bear sporangia which produce spores.uThe spores germinate to form  gametophytes which require cool, dampplaces to grow. The gametophytes bear male and female sex organs calledantheridia and archegonia, respectively. Water is required for transfer ofmale gametes to archegonium where zygote is formed after fertilisation.The zygote produces a sporophyte.The gymnosperms are the plants in which ovules are not enclosed byany ovary wall. After fertilisation the seeds remain exposed and thereforeuthese plants are called naked-seeded plants. The gymnosperms producemicrospores and megaspores which are produced in microsporangia andumegasporangia borne on the sporophylls. The sporophylls –microsporophylls and megasporophylls – are arranged spirally on axisto form male and female cones, respectively. The pollen grain germinatesuand pollen tube releases the male gamete into the ovule, where it fuseswith the egg cell in archegonia. Following fertilisation, the zygote developsinto embryo and the ovules into seeds.The angiosperms are divided into two classes – the dicotyledons andthe monocotyledons.EXERCISES1.What is the basis of classification of algae?2.When and where does reduction division take place in the life cycle of aliverwort, a moss, a fern, a gymnosperm and an angiosperm?3.Name three groups of plants that bear archegonia.

    "input": "ANIMAL KINGDOM3737When you look around, you will observe different animals with differentstructures and forms.  As over a million species of animals have beendescribed till now, the need for classification becomes all the moreimportant. The classification also helps in assigning a systematic positiondto newly described species.4.1BASIS OF CLASSIFICATIONInspite of differences in structure and form of different animals, there aredfundamental features common to various individuals in relation to thearrangement of cells, body symmetry, nature of coelom, patterns ofdigestive, circulatory or reproductive systems. These features are useddas the basis of animal classification and some of them are discussed here.4.1.1Levels of OrganisationThough all members of Animalia are multicellular, all of them do notdexhibit the same pattern of organisation of cells. For example, in sponges,the cells are arranged as loose cell aggregates, i.e., they exhibit cellularlevel of organisation. Some division of labour (activities) occur amongthe cells. In coelenterates, the arrangement of cells is more complex. Heredthe cells performing the same function are arranged into tissues, hence iscalled tissue level of organisation. A still higher level of organisation, i.e.,organ level is exhibited by members of Platyhelminthes and other higherphyla where tissues are grouped together to form organs, each specialiseddfor a particular function. In animals like Annelids, Arthropods, Molluscs,ANIMAL KINGDOMCHAPTER  44.1Basis ofClassification4.2Classification ofuAnimals2024-2538BIOLOGYEchinoderms and Chordates, organs haveassociated to form functional systems, eachsystem concerned with a specific physiologicaldfunction. This pattern is called organ systemlevel of organisation. Organ systems in differentdgroups of animals exhibit various patterns ofdcomplexities. For example, the digestive systemin Platyhelminthes has only a single openingto the outside of the body that serves as bothdmouth and anus, and is hence calledincomplete. A complete digestive system hastwo openings, mouth and anus. Similarly, thecirculatory system may be of two types:(i) open type in which the blood is pumpedout of the heart and the cells and tissues aredirectly bathed in it and(ii) closed type in which the blood is circulatedthrough a series of vessels of varying diameters(arteries, veins and capillaries).4.1.2SymmetryAnimals can be categorised on the basis of theirsymmetry. Sponges are mostly  asymmetrical,i.e., any plane that passes through the centreddoes not divide them into equal halves. Whenany plane passing through the central axis ofthe body divides the organism into two identicaldhalves, it is called radial symmetry.Coelenterates, ctenophores and echinodermshave this kind of body plan (Figure 4.1a).Animals like annelids, arthropods, etc., wheredthe body can be divided into identical left anddright halves in only one plane, exhibit bilateralsymmetry (Figure 4.1b).4.1.3Diploblastic and TriploblasticOrganisationAnimals in which the cells are arranged in twoembryonic layers, an external ectoderm andan internal endoderm, are called diploblasticanimals, e.g., coelenterates. An undifferentiatedlayer, mesoglea, is present in between theectoderm and the endoderm (Figure 4.2a).Figure 4.2Showing germinal layers :(a) Diploblastic (b) Triploblastic(a)(b)EctodermMesogleaEndodermMesodermFigure 4.1 (b) Bilateral symmetryFigure 4.1 (a)  Radial symmetry2024-25ANIMAL KINGDOM39394.1.4CoelomPresence or absence of a cavity between the bodywall and the gut wall is very important inclassification. The body cavity, which is linedby mesoderm is called coelom. Animalspossessing coelom are called coelomates, e.g.,annelids, molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms,hemichordates and chordates (Figure 4.3a). Insome animals, the body cavity is not lined bymesoderm, instead, the mesoderm is present asscattered pouches in between the ectoderm andendoderm. Such a body cavity is calledpseudocoelom and the animals possessing themare called pseudocoelomates, e.g.,aschelminthes (Figure 4.3b). The animals inwhich the body cavity is absent are calledacoelomates, e.g., platyhelminthes (Figure 4.3c).Figure 4.3Diagrammatic sectional view of :(a) Coelomate (b) Pseudocoelomate(c) AcoelomateThose animals in which the developing embryo has a third germinal layer,mesoderm, in between the ectoderm and endoderm, are calledtriploblastic animals (platyhelminthes to chordates, Figure 4.2b).4.1.5SegmentationIn some animals, the body is externally and internally divided intosegments with a serial repetition of at least some organs. For example, indearthworm, the body shows this pattern called metameric segmentationand the phenomenon is known as metamerism.4.1.6NotochordNotochord is a mesodermally derived rod-like structure formed on thedorsal side during embryonic development in some animals. Animals withdnotochord are called chordates and those animals which do not form thisstructure are called non-chordates, e.g., porifera to echinoderms.4.2CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALSThe broad classification of Animalia based on common fundamentalfeatures as mentioned in the preceding sections is given in Figure  4.4.2024-2540BIOLOGYThe important characteristic features of thedifferent phyla are described.4.2.1Phylum – PoriferaMembers of this phylum are commonly knownas sponges. They are generally marine and mostlyasymmetrical animals (Figure 4.5). These aredprimitive multicellular animals and have cellulardlevel of organisation. Sponges have a watertransport or canal system. Water enters throughminute pores (ostia) in the body wall into a centralcavity, spongocoel, from where it goes outthrough the osculum. This pathway of watertransport is helpful in food gathering, respiratoryexchange and removal of waste. Choanocytesor collar cells line the spongocoel and the canals.dDigestion is intracellular. The body is supportedby a skeleton made up of spicules or sponginfibres. Sexes are not separate (hermaphrodite),i.e., eggs and sperms are produced by the samedindividual. Sponges reproduce asexually byfragmentation and sexually by formation ofgametes. Fertilisation is internal and developmentdis indirect having a larval stage which isdmorphologically distinct from the adult.*Echinodermata exhibits radial or bilateral symmetry depending on the stage.Figure 4.4  Broad classification of Kingdom Animalia based on common fundamental features(a)(b)(c)Figure 4.5Examples of Porifera : (a) Sycon(b) Euspongia  (c) Spongilla2024-25ANIMAL KINGDOM4141cnidoblasts or cnidocytes (which contain the stinging capsules ornematocysts) present on the tentacles and the body. Cnidoblasts are usedfor anchorage, defense and for the capture of prey (Figure 4.7). Cnidariansexhibit tissue level of organisation and are diploblastic. They have a centraldgastro-vascular cavity with a single opening, mouth on hypostome.Digestion is extracellular and intracellular. Some of the cnidarians, e.g.,corals have a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate. Cnidarians exhibittwo basic body forms called polyp and medusa (Figure 4.6). The formeris a sessile and cylindrical form like Hydra, Adamsia, etc. whereas, thelatter is umbrella-shaped and free-swimming like Aurelia or jelly fish.Those cnidarians which exist in both forms exhibit alternation ofdgeneration (Metagenesis), i.e., polyps produce medusae asexually andmedusae form the polyps sexually (e.g., Obelia).Examples: Physalia (Portuguese man-of-war), Adamsia (Sea anemone),Pennatula (Sea-pen), Gorgonia (Sea-fan) and Meandrina (Brain coral).Figure 4.7Diagrammatic view ofCnidoblastFigure 4.6Examples of  Coelenterata indicating outline of their body form :(a) Aurelia (Medusa) (b) Adamsia (Polyp)(b)(a)Examples: Sycon (Scypha), Spongilla (Fresh water sponge) and Euspongia(Bath sponge).4.2.2Phylum – Coelenterata (Cnidaria)They are aquatic, mostly marine, sessile or free-swimming, radiallysymmetrical animals (Figure 4.6). The name cnidaria is derived from the2024-2542BIOLOGY4.2.3Phylum – CtenophoraCtenophores, commonly known as sea walnuts or combjellies are exclusively marine, radially symmetrical, diploblasticorganisms with tissue level of organisation. The body bearseight external rows of ciliated comb plates, which help inlocomotion (Figure 4.8). Digestion is both extracellular andintracellular. Bioluminescence (the property of a livingorganism to emit light) is well-marked in ctenophores. Sexesare not separate. Reproduction takes place only by sexualdmeans. Fertilisation is external with indirect development.Examples: Pleurobrachia and Ctenoplana.4.2.4Phylum – PlatyhelminthesThey have dorso-ventrally flattened body, hence are calledflatworms (Figure 4.9). These are mostly endoparasites foundin animals including human beings. Flatworms are bilaterallysymmetrical, triploblastic and acoelomate animals with organlevel of organisation. Hooks and suckers are present in thedparasitic forms. Some of them absorb nutrients from the hostddirectly through their body surface. Specialised cells calleddflame cells help in osmoregulation and excretion. Sexes are notseparate. Fertilisation is internal and development is throughmany larval stages. Some members like Planaria possess highregeneration capacity.Examples: Taenia (Tapeworm), Fasciola (Liver fluke).Figure 4.8Example ofCtenophora(Pleurobrachia)(a)(b)Figure 4.9 Examples of Platyhelminthes : (a) Tape worm (b) Liver fluke2024-25ANIMAL KINGDOM43434.2.5Phylum – AschelminthesThe body of the aschelminthes is circular incross-section, hence, the name roundworms(Figure 4.10). They may be freeliving, aquaticand terrestrial or parasitic in plants and animals.Roundworms have organ-system level of bodydorganisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical,triploblastic and pseudocoelomate animals.Alimentary canal is complete with a well-ddeveloped muscular pharynx. An excretorytube removes body wastes from the body cavitydthrough the excretory pore. Sexes are separated(dioecious), i.e., males and females are distinct.Often females are longer than males. Fertilisationdis internal and development may be direct (thedyoung ones resemble the adult) or indirect.Examples : Ascaris (Roundworm), Wuchereria(Filaria worm), Ancylostoma (Hookworm).4.2.6Phylum – AnnelidaThey may be aquatic (marine and fresh water) orterrestrial; free-living, and sometimes parasitic.They exhibit organ-system level of bodydorganisation and bilateral symmetry. They aretriploblastic, metamerically segmented andcoelomate animals. Their body surface isddistinctly marked out into segments ormetameres and, hence, the phylum nameAnnelida (Latin, annulus : little ring) (Figure 4.11).They possess longitudinal and circular muscleswhich help in locomotion. Aquatic annelids likeNereis possess lateral appendages, parapodia,which help in swimming. A closed circulatorysystem is present. Nephridia (sing. nephridium)help in osmoregulation and excretion. Neuralsystem consists of paired ganglia (sing. ganglion)connected by lateral nerves to a double ventraldnerve cord. Nereis,an aquatic form, is dioecious,but earthworms and leeches are monoecious.Reproduction is sexual.Examples : Nereis, Pheretima (Earthworm) andHirudinaria (Blood sucking leech).Figure 4.11Examples of Annelida : (a) Nereis(b) HirudinariaMaleFemaleFigure 4.10Example ofAschelminthes:dRoundworm2024-2544BIOLOGY4.2.7Phylum – ArthropodaThis is the largest phylum of Animalia whichincludes insects. Over two-thirds of all namedspecies on earth are arthropods (Figure 4.12).They have organ-system level of organisation.They are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic,dsegmented and coelomate animals. The bodyof arthropods is covered by chitinousexoskeleton. The body consists of head, thoraxand abdomen. They have jointed appendages(arthros-joint, poda-appendages). Respiratoryorgans are gills, book gills, book lungs ortracheal system. Circulatory system is of opendtype. Sensory organs like antennae, eyes(compound and simple), statocysts orbalancing organs are present.  Excretion takesplace through malpighian tubules. They aremostly dioecious. Fertilisation is usuallyinternal. They are mostly oviparous.Development may be direct or indirect.Examples: Economically important insects –Apis (Honey bee), Bombyx (Silkworm), Laccifer(Lac insect)Vectors – Anopheles, Culex and Aedes(Mosquitoes)Gregarious pest – Locusta (Locust)Living fossil – Limulus (King crab).4.2.8Phylum – MolluscaThis is the second largest animal phylum(Figure 4.13). Molluscs are terrestrial or aquatic(marine or fresh water) having an organ-systemlevel of organisation. They are bilaterallydsymmetrical, triploblastic and coelomatedanimals. Body is covered by a calcareous shelland is unsegmented with a distinct head,muscular foot and visceral hump. A soft andspongy layer of skin forms a mantle over thevisceral hump. The space between the humpand the mantle is called the mantle cavity inwhich feather like gills are present. They havedrespiratory and excretory functions. Thedanterior head region has sensory tentacles. Themouth contains a file-like rasping organ forfeeding, called radula.Figure 4.12Examples of Arthropoda :(a) Locust (b) Butterfly(c) Scorpion (d) Prawn (a) (c) (b) (d)Figure 4.13Examples of Mollusca :d(a) Pila  (b) Octopus(b)(a)2024-25ANIMAL KINGDOM4545They are usually dioecious and oviparous with indirectdevelopment.Examples: Pila (Apple snail), Pinctada (Pearl oyster), Sepia(Cuttlefish), Loligo (Squid), Octopus (Devil fish), Aplysia (Sea-hare), Dentalium (Tusk shell) and Chaetopleura (Chiton).4.2.9Phylum – EchinodermataThese animals have an endoskeleton of calcareous ossiclesand, hence, the name Echinodermata (Spiny bodied, Figure4.14). All are marine with organ-system level of organisation.dThe adult echinoderms are radially symmetrical but larvaeare bilaterally symmetrical. They are triploblastic andcoelomate animals. Digestive system is complete with mouthdon the lower (ventral) side and anus on the upper (dorsal)side. The most distinctive feature of echinoderms is thepresence of water vascular system which helps inlocomotion, capture and transport of food and respiration.An excretory system is absent. Sexes are separate.Reproduction is sexual. Fertilisation is usually external.dDevelopment is indirect with free-swimming larva.Examples: Asterias (Star fish), Echinus (Sea urchin), Antedon(Sea lily), Cucumaria (Sea cucumber) and Ophiura (Brittle star).4.2.10Phylum – HemichordataHemichordata was earlier considered as a sub-phylum underphylum Chordata. But now it is placed as a separate phylumdunder non-chordata. Hemichordates have a rudimentarystructure in the collar region called stomochord, a structuresimilar to notochord.This phylum consists of a small group of worm-likemarine animals with organ-system level of organisation. Theydare bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and coelomatedanimals. The body is cylindrical and is composed of ananterior proboscis, a collar and a long trunk (Figure 4.15).Circulatory system is of  open type. Respiration takes placethrough gills. Excretory organ is proboscis gland. Sexes areseparate. Fertilisation is external. Development is indirect.Examples: Balanoglossus and Saccoglossus.4.2.11Phylum – ChordataAnimals belonging to phylum Chordata are fundamentallycharacterised by the presence of a notochord, a dorsalFigure 4.14Examples ofEchinodermata :(a) Asterias(b) Ophiura(a)(b)Figure 4.15 BalanoglossusProboscisCollarTrunk2024-2546BIOLOGYhollow nerve cord and paired pharyngealgill slits (Figure 4.16). These are bilaterallysymmetrical, triploblastic,  coelomate withorgan-system level of organisation. Theypossess a post anal tail and a closed circulatorysystem.dTable 4.1 presents a comparison of salientfeatures of chordates and non-chordates.Phylum Chordata is divided into threesubphyla: Urochordata or Tunicata,Cephalochordata and Vertebrata.Subphyla Urochordata andCephalochordata are often referred to asfprotochordates (Figure 4.17) and areexclusively marine. In Urochordata, notochordis present only in larval tail, while indCephalochordata, it extends from head to tailregion and is persistent throughout their life.Examples: Urochordata – Ascidia, Salpa,Doliolum; Cephalochordata – Branchiostoma(Amphioxus or Lancelet).The members of subphylum Vertebratapossess notochord during the embryonicperiod. The notochord is replaced by acartilaginous or bony vertebral column in theadult. Thus all vertebrates are chordates butdall chordates are not vertebrates. Besides thebasic chordate characters, vertebrates have aventral muscular heart with two, three or fourchambers, kidneys for excretion anddosmoregulation and paired appendages whichdmay be fins or limbs.Nerve cordNotochordPost-anal partGill slitsFigure 4.16  Chordata characteristicsFigure 4.17  AscidiaTABLE 4.1 Comparison of Chordates and Non-chordatesS.No.ChordatesNon-chordates1.Notochord present.Notochord absent.2.Central nervous system is dorsal,Central nervous system is ventral, solidhollow and single.and double.3.Pharynx perforated by gill slits.Gill slits are absent.4.Heart is ventral.Heart is dorsal (if present).5.A post-anal part (tail) is present.Post-anal tail is absent.2024-25ANIMAL KINGDOM47474.2.11.14.2.11.14.2.11.14.2.11.14.2.11.1Class – CyclostomataClass – CyclostomataClass – CyclostomataClass – CyclostomataClass – CyclostomataAll living members of the class Cyclostomata areectoparasites on some fishes.

Besides the fundamental features,there are many other distinctive characters which are specific for eachphyla or class.Porifera includes multicellular animals which exhibit cellular level oforganisation and have characteristic flagellated choanocytes. Thecoelenterates have tentacles and bear cnidoblasts. They are mostly aquatic,dsessile or free-floating. The ctenophores are marine animals with combplates. The platyhelminths have flat body and exhibit bilateral symmetry.The parasitic forms show distinct suckers and hooks. Aschelminthes arepseudocoelomates and  include parasitic as well as non-parasiticroundworms.Annelids are metamerically segmented animals with a true coelom.The arthropods are the most abundant group of animals characteriseddby the presence of jointed appendages. The molluscs have a soft bodysurrounded by an external calcareous shell. The body is covered withexternal skeleton made of chitin. The echinoderms possess a spiny skin.Their most distinctive feature is the presence of water vascular system.The hemichordates are a small group of worm-like marine animals. Theydhave a cylindrical body with proboscis, collar and trunk.Phylum Chordata includes animals which possess a notochord eitherthroughout or during early embryonic life. Other common featuresobserved in the chordates are the dorsal, hollow nerve cord and pairedpharyngeal gill slits. Some of the vertebrates do not possess jaws (Agnatha)dwhereas most of them possess jaws (Gnathostomata). Agnatha isrepresented by the class, Cyclostomata. They are the most primitivechordates and are ectoparasites on fishes. Gnathostomata has two superclasses, Pisces and Tetrapoda. Classes Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyesbear fins for locomotion and are grouped under Pisces. TheChondrichthyes are fishes with cartilaginous endoskeleton and are marine.Classes, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves and Mammalia have two pairs of limbsdand are thus grouped under Tetrapoda. The amphibians have adaptedto live both on land and water. Reptiles are characterised by the presence2024-25ANIMAL KINGDOM5353of dry and cornified skin. Limbs are absent in snakes. Fishes, amphibiansand reptiles are poikilothermous (cold-blooded). Aves are warm-bloodedanimals with feathers on their bodies and forelimbs modified into wingsfor flying. Hind limbs are adapted for walking, swimming, perching orclasping. The unique features of mammals are the presence of mammarydglands and hairs on the skin. They commonly exhibit viviparity.EXERCISES1.What are the difficulties that you would face in classification of animals,if common fundamental features are not taken into account?2.If you are given a specimen, what are the steps that you would follow todclassify it?3.How useful is the study of the nature of body cavity and coelom in theclassification of animals?4.Distinguish between intracellular and extracellular digestion?5.What is the difference between direct and indirect development?6.What are the peculiar features that you find in parasiticplatyhelminthes?7.What are the reasons that you can think of for the arthropods todconstitute the largest group of the animal kingdom?8.Water vascular system is the characteristic of which group of thefollowing:(a) Porifera  (b) Ctenophora  (c) Echinodermata  (d) Chordata9.“All vertebrates are chordates but all chordates are not vertebrates”.Justify the statement.10.How important is the presence of air bladder in Pisces?11.What are the modifications that are observed in birds that help themdfly?12.Could the number of eggs or young ones produced by an oviparous andviviparous mother be equal?

This description is mainly of gross structural features, both external and internal. In addition, observable and perceivable living phenomena were also recorded as part of this description. Before experimental biology or more specifically, physiology, was established as a part of biology, naturalists described only biology. Hence, biology remained as a natural history for a long time. The description, by itself, was amazing in terms of detail. While the initial reaction of a student could be boredom, one should keep in mind that the detailed description, was utilised in the later day reductionist biology where living processes drew more attention from scientists than the description of life forms and their structure. Hence, this description became meaningful and helpful in framing research questions in physiology or evolutionary biology. In the following chapters of this unit, the structural organisation of plants and animals, including the structural basis of physiologial or behavioural phenomena, is described. For convenience, this description of morphological and anatomical features is presented separately for plants and animals.\r\n\r\n2024-25\r\n\r\nKatherine Esau (1898 – 1997)\r\n\r\nKATHERINE ESAU was born in Ukraine in 1898. She studied agriculture in Russia and Germany and received her doctorate in 1931 in United States. She reported in her early publications that the curly top virus spreads through a plant via the food-conducting or phloem tissue. Dr Esau's Plant Anatomy published in 1954 took a dynamic, developmental approach designed to enhance one's understanding of plant structure and an enormous impact worldwide, literally bringing about a revival of the discipline. The Anatomy of Seed Plants by Katherine Esau was published in 1960. It was referred to as Webster's of plant biology – it is encyclopediac. In 1957 she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, becoming the sixth woman to receive that honour. In addition to this prestigious award, she received the National Medal of Science from President George Bush in 1989. When Katherine Esau died in the year 1997, Peter Raven, director of Anatomy and Morphology, Missouri Botanical Garden, remembered that she 'absolutely dominated' the field of plant biology even at the age of 99.\r\n\r\n2024-25\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5 MORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS\r\n5.1 The Root\r\n5.2 The Stem\r\n5.3 The Leaf\r\n5.4 The Inflorescence\r\n5.5 The Flower\r\n5.6 The Fruit\r\n5.7 The Seed\r\n5.8 Semi-technical Description of a Typical Flowering Plant\r\n5.9 Description of Some Important Families\r\n\r\nThe wide range in the structure of higher plants will never fail to fascinate us. Even though the angiosperms show such a large diversity in external structure or morphology, they are all characterised by presence of roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits. In chapters 2 and 3, we talked about classification of plants based on morphological and other characteristics. For any successful attempt at classification and at understanding any higher plant (or for that matter any living organism) we need to know standard technical terms and standard definitions. We also need to know about the possible variations in different parts, found as adaptations of the plants to their environment, e.g., adaptions to various habitats, for protection, climbing, storage, etc. If you pull out any weed you will see that all of them have roots, stems and leaves. They may be bearing flowers and fruits. The underground part of the flowering plant is the root system while the portion above the ground forms the shoot system (Figure 5.1).\r\n\r\n5.1 THE ROOT\r\nIn majority of the dicotyledonous plants, the direct elongation of the radicle leads to the formation of primary root which grows inside the soil. It bears lateral roots of several orders that are referred to as secondary, tertiary, etc. roots. The primary roots and its branches constitute the tap root system, as seen in the mustard plant (Figure 5.2a). In monocotyledonous plants, the primary root is short lived and is replaced by a large number of roots. These roots originate from the base of the stem and constitute the fibrous root system, as seen in the wheat plant (Figure 5.2b). In some plants, like grass, Monstera and the banyan tree, roots arise from parts of the plant other than the radicle and are called adventitious roots (Figure 5.2c). The main functions of the root system are absorption of water and minerals from the soil, providing a proper anchorage to the plant parts, storing reserve food material and synthesis of plant growth regulators.\r\n\r\n5.1.1 Regions of the Root\r\nThe root is covered at the apex by a thimble-like structure called the root cap (Figure 5.3). It protects the tender apex of the root as it makes its way through the soil. A few millimetres above the root cap is the region of meristematic activity. The cells of this region are very small, thin-walled and with dense protoplasm. They divide repeatedly. The cells proximal to this region undergo rapid elongation and enlargement and are responsible for the growth of the root in length. This region is called the region of elongation. The cells of the elongation zone gradually differentiate and mature. Hence, this zone, proximal to region of elongation, is called the region of maturation. From this region some of the epidermal cells form very fine and delicate, thread-like structures called root hairs. These root hairs absorb water and minerals from the soil.\r\n\r\n5.2 THE STEM\r\nWhat are the features that distinguish a stem from a root? The stem is the ascending part of the axis bearing branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. It develops from the plumule of the embryo of a germinating seed. The stem bears nodes and internodes. The region of the stem where leaves are born are called nodes while internodes are the portions between two nodes. The stem bears buds, which may be terminal or axillary. Stem is generally green when young and later often become woody and dark brown. The main function of the stem is spreading out branches bearing leaves, flowers and fruits. It conducts water, minerals and photosynthates. Some stems perform the function of storage of food, support, protection and of vegetative propagation.\r\n\r\n5.3 THE LEAF\r\nThe leaf is a lateral, generally flattened structure borne on the stem. It develops at the node and bears a bud in its axil. The axillary bud later develops into a branch. Leaves originate from shoot apical meristems and are arranged in an acropetal order. They are the most important vegetative organs for photosynthesis.\r\n\r\nA typical leaf consists of three main parts: leaf base, petiole and lamina (Figure 5.4 a). The leaf is attached to the stem by the leaf base and may bear two lateral small leaf like structures called stipules. In monocotyledons, the leaf base expands into a sheath covering the stem partially or wholly. In some leguminous plants the leafbase may become swollen, which is called the pulvinus. The petiole help hold the blade to light. Long thin flexible petioles allow leaf blades to flutter in wind, thereby cooling the leaf and bringing fresh air to leaf surface. The lamina or the leaf blade is the green expanded part of the leaf with veins and veinlets. There is, usually, a middle prominent vein, which is known as the midrib. Veins provide rigidity to the leaf blade and act as channels of transport for water, minerals and food materials. The shape, margin, apex, surface and extent of incision of lamina varies in different leaves.\r\n\r\n5.3.1 Venation\r\nThe arrangement of veins and the veinlets in the lamina of leaf is termed as venation. When the veinlets form a network, the venation is termed as reticulate (Figure 5.4 b). When the veins run parallel to each other within a lamina, the venation is termed as parallel (Figure 5.4 c). Leaves of dicotyledonous plants generally possess reticulate venation, while parallel venation is the characteristic of most monocotyledons.\r\n\r\n5.3.2 Types of Leaves\r\nA leaf is said to be simple, when its lamina is entire or when incised, the incisions do not touch the midrib. When the incisions of the lamina reach up to the midrib breaking it into a number of leaflets, the leaf is called compound. A bud is present in the axil of petiole in both simple and compound leaves, but not in the axil of leaflets of the compound leaf. The compound leaves may be of two types (Figure 5.5). In a pinnately compound leaf a number of leaflets are present on a common axis, the rachis, which represents the midrib of the leaf as in neem. In palmately compound leaves, the leaflets are attached at a common point, i.e., at the tip of petiole, as in silk cotton.\r\n\r\n5.3.3 Phyllotaxy\r\nPhyllotaxy is the pattern of arrangement of leaves on the stem or branch. This is usually of three types – alternate, opposite and whorled (Figure 5.6). In alternate type of phyllotaxy, a single leaf arises at each node in alternate manner, as in china rose, mustard and sun flower plants. In opposite type, a pair of leaves arise at each node and lie opposite to each other as in Calotropis and guava plants. If more than two leaves arise at a node and form a whorl, it is called whorled, as in Alstonia.\r\n\r\n5.4 THE INFLORESCENCE\r\nA flower is a modified shoot wherein the shoot apical meristem changes to floral meristem. Internodes do not elongate and the axis gets condensed. The apex produces different kinds of floral appendages laterally at successive nodes instead of leaves. When a shoot tip transforms into a flower, it is always solitary. The arrangement of flowers on the floral axis is termed as inflorescence. Depending on whether the apex gets developed into a flower or continues to grow, two major types of inflorescences are defined – racemose and cymose. In racemose type of inflorescences the main axis continues to grow, the flowers are borne laterally in an acropetal succession (Figure 5.7). In cymose type of inflorescence the main axis terminates in a flower, hence is limited in growth. The flowers are borne in a basipetal order (Figure 5.7).\r\n\r\n5.5 THE FLOWER\r\nThe flower is the reproductive unit in the angiosperms. It is meant for sexual reproduction. A typical flower has four different kinds of whorls arranged successively on the swollen end of the stalk or pedicel, called thalamus or receptacle. These are calyx, corolla, androecium and gynoecium. Calyx and corolla are accessory organs, while androecium and gynoecium are reproductive organs. In some flowers like lily, the calyx and corolla are not distinct and are termed as perianth. When a flower has both androecium and gynoecium, it is bisexual. A flower having either only stamens or only carpels is unisexual.\r\n\r\nIn symmetry, the flower may be actinomorphic (radial symmetry) or zygomorphic (bilateral symmetry). When a flower can be divided into two equal radial halves in any radial plane passing through the centre, it is said to be actinomorphic, e.g., mustard, datura, chilli. When it can be divided into two similar halves only in one particular vertical plane, it is zygomorphic, e.g., pea, gulmohur, bean, Cassia. A flower is asymmetric (irregular) if it cannot be divided into two similar halves by any vertical plane passing through the centre, as in canna.\r\n\r\nA flower may be trimerous, tetramerous or pentamerous when the floral appendages are in multiple of 3, 4 or 5, respectively. Flowers with bracts -reduced leaf found at the base of the pedicel - are called bracteate and those without bracts, ebracteate.\r\n\r\nBased on the position of calyx, corolla and androecium in respect of the ovary on thalamus, the flowers are described as hypogynous, perigynous and epigynous (Figure 5.9). In the hypogynous flower the gynoecium occupies the highest position while the other parts are situated below it. The ovary in such flowers is said to be superior, e.g., mustard, china rose and brinjal. If gynoecium is situated in the centre and other parts of the flower are located on the rim of the thalamus almost at the same level, it is called perigynous. The ovary here is said to be half inferior, e.g., plum, rose, peach. In epigynous flowers, the margin of thalamus grows upward enclosing the ovary completely and getting fused with it, the other parts of flower arise above the ovary. Hence, the ovary is said to be inferior as in flowers of guava and cucumber, and the ray florets of sunflower.\r\n\r\n5.5.1 Parts of a Flower\r\nEach flower normally has four floral whorls, viz., calyx, corolla, androecium and gynoecium (Figure 5.10).\r\n\r\n5.5.1.1 Calyx\r\nThe calyx is the outermost whorl of the flower and the members are called sepals. Generally, sepals are green, leaf like and protect the flower in the bud stage. The calyx may be gamosepalous (sepals united) or polysepalous (sepals free).\r\n\r\n5.5.1.2 Corolla\r\nCorolla is composed of petals. Petals are usually brightly coloured to attract insects for pollination. Like calyx, corolla may also be gamopetalous (petals united) or polypetalous (petals free). The shape and colour of corolla vary greatly in plants. Corolla may be tubular, bell-shaped, funnel-shaped or wheel-shaped.\r\n\r\nAestivation: The mode of arrangement of sepals or petals in floral bud with respect to the other members of the same whorl is known as aestivation. The main types of aestivation are valvate, twisted, imbricate and vexillary (Figure 5.11). When sepals or petals in a whorl just touch one another at the margin, without overlapping, as in Calotropis, it is said to be valvate. If one margin of the appendage overlaps that of the next one and so on as in china rose, lady's finger and cotton, it is called twisted. If the margins of sepals or petals overlap one another but not in any particular direction as in Cassia and gulmohur, the aestivation is called imbricate. In pea and bean flowers, there are five petals, the largest (standard) overlaps the two lateral petals (wings) which in turn overlap the two smallest anterior petals (keel); this type of aestivation is known as vexillary or papilionaceous.\r\n\r\n5.5.1.3 Androecium\r\nAndroecium is composed of stamens. Each stamen which represents the male reproductive organ consists of a stalk or a filament and an anther. Each anther is usually bilobed and each lobe has two chambers, the pollen-sacs. The pollen grains are produced in pollen-sacs. A sterile stamen is called staminode.\r\n\r\nStamens of flower may be united with other members such as petals or among themselves. When stamens are attached to the petals, they are epipetalous as in brinjal, or epiphyllous when attached to the perianth as in the flowers of lily. The stamens in a flower may either remain free (polyandrous) or may be united in varying degrees. The stamens may be united into one bunch or one bundle (monoadelphous) as in china rose, or two bundles (diadelphous) as in pea, or into more than two bundles (polyadelphous) as in citrus. There may be a variation in the length of filaments within a flower, as in Salvia and mustard.\r\n\r\n5.5.1.4 Gynoecium\r\nGynoecium is the female reproductive part of the flower and is made up of one or more carpels. A carpel consists of three parts namely stigma, style and ovary. Ovary is the enlarged basal part, on which lies the elongated tube, the style. The style connects the ovary to the stigma. The stigma is usually at the tip of the style and is the receptive surface for pollen grains. Each ovary bears one or more ovules attached to a flattened, cushion-like placenta. When more than one carpel is present, they may be free (as in lotus and rose) and are called apocarpous. They are termed syncarpous when carpels are fused, as in mustard and tomato. After fertilisation, the ovules develop into seeds and the ovary matures into a fruit.\r\n\r\nPlacentation: The arrangement of ovules within the ovary is known as placentation. The placentation are of different types namely, marginal, axile, parietal, basal, central and free central (Figure 5.12). In marginal placentation the placenta forms a ridge along the ventral suture of the ovary and the ovules are borne on this ridge forming two rows, as in pea. When the placenta is axial and the ovules are attached to it in a multilocular ovary, the placentaion is said to be axile, as in china rose, tomato and lemon. In parietal placentation, the ovules develop on the inner wall of the ovary or on peripheral part. Ovary is one-chambered but it becomes two-chambered due to the formation of the false septum, e.g., mustard and Argemone. When the ovules are borne on central axis and septa are absent, as in Dianthus and Primrose the placentation is called free central. In basal placentation, the placenta develops at the base of ovary and a single ovule is attached to it, as in sunflower, marigold.\r\n\r\n5.6 THE FRUIT\r\nThe fruit is a characteristic feature of the flowering plants. It is a mature or ripened ovary, developed after fertilisation. If a fruit is formed without fertilisation of the ovary, it is called a parthenocarpic fruit. Generally, the fruit consists of a wall or pericarp and seeds. The pericarp may be dry or fleshy. When pericarp is thick and fleshy, it is differentiated into the outer epicarp, the middle mesocarp and the inner endocarp. In mango and coconut, the fruit is known as a drupe (Figure 5.13). They develop from monocarpellary superior ovaries and are one seeded. In mango the pericarp is well differentiated into an outer thin epicarp, a middle fleshy edible mesocarp and an inner stony hard endocarp. In coconut which is also a drupe, the mesocarp is fibrous.\r\n\r\n5.7 THE SEED\r\nThe ovules after fertilisation, develop into seeds. A seed is made up of a seed coat and an embryo. The embryo is made up of a radicle, an embryonal axis and one (as in wheat, maize) or two cotyledons (as in gram and pea).\r\n\r\n5.7.1 Structure of a Dicotyledonous Seed\r\nThe outermost covering of a seed is the seed coat. The seed coat has two layers, the outer testa and the inner tegmen. The hilum is a scar on the seed coat through which the developing seeds were attached to the fruit. Above the hilum is a small pore called the micropyle. Within the seed coat is the embryo, consisting of an embryonal axis and two cotyledons. The cotyledons are often fleshy and full of reserve food materials. At the two ends of the embryonal axis are present the radicle and the plumule (Figure 5.14). In some seeds such as castor the endosperm formed as a result of double fertilisation, is a food storing tissue and called endospermic seeds. In plants such as bean, gram and pea, the endosperm is not present in mature seeds and such seeds are called non-endospermous.\r\n\r\n5.7.2 Structure of Monocotyledonous Seed\r\nGenerally, monocotyledonous seeds are endospermic but some as in orchids are non-endospermic. In the seeds of cereals such as maize the seed coat is membranous and generally fused with the fruit wall. The endosperm is bulky and stores food. The outer covering of endosperm separates the embryo by a proteinous layer called aleurone layer. The embryo is small and situated in a groove at one end of the endosperm. It consists of one large and shield shaped cotyledon known as scutellum and a short axis with a plumule and a radicle. The plumule and radicle are enclosed in sheaths which are called coleoptile and coleorhiza respectively (Figure 5.15).\r\n\r\n5.8 SEMI-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL FLOWERING PLANT\r\nVarious morphological features are used to describe a flowering plant. The description has to be brief, in a simple and scientific language and presented in a proper sequence. The plant is described beginning with its habit, vegetative characters – roots, stem and leaves and then floral characters inflorescence and flower parts. After describing various parts of plant, a floral diagram and a floral formula are presented. The floral formula is represented by some symbols. In the floral formula, Br stands for bracteate K stands for calyx, C for corolla, P for perianth, A for androecium and G for Gynoecium, G for superior ovary and G for inferior ovary, ♂ for male, ♀ for female, ⚥ for bisexual plants, ⊕ for actinomorphic and ⚹ for zygomorphic nature of flower. Fusion is indicated by enclosing the figure within bracket and adhesion by a line drawn above the symbols of the floral parts. A floral diagram provides information about the number of parts of a flower, their arrangement and the relation they have with one another (Figure 5.16). The position of the mother axis with respect to the flower is represented by a dot on the top of the floral diagram. Calyx, corolla, androecium and gynoecium are drawn in successive whorls, calyx being the outermost and the gynoecium being in the centre. Floral formula also shows cohesion and adhesion within parts of whorls and between whorls. The floral diagram and floral formula in Figure 5.16 represents the mustard plant (Family: Brassicaceae).\r\n\r\n5.9 SOLANACEAE\r\nIt is a large family, commonly called as the 'potato family'. It is widely distributed in tropics, subtropics and even temperate zones (Figure 5.17).\r\n\r\nVegetative Characters\r\nPlants mostly herbs, shrubs and rarely small trees\r\nStem: herbaceous rarely woody, aerial; erect, cylindrical, branched, solid or hollow, hairy or glabrous, underground stem in potato (Solanum tuberosum)\r\nLeaves: alternate, simple, rarely pinnately compound, exstipulate; venation reticulate\r\n\r\nFloral Characters\r\nInflorescence: Solitary, axillary or cymose as in Solanum\r\nFlower: bisexual, actinomorphic\r\nCalyx: sepals five, united, persistent, valvate aestivation\r\nCorolla: petals five, united; valvate aestivation\r\nAndroecium: stamens five, epipetalous\r\nGynoecium: bicarpellary obligately placed, syncarpous; ovary superior, bilocular, placenta swollen with many ovules, axile\r\nFruits: berry or capsule\r\nSeeds: many, endospermous\r\nFloral Formula: ⊕ ⚥ K(5) C(5) A5 G(2)\r\n\r\nEconomic Importance\r\nMany plants belonging to this family are source of food (tomato, brinjal, potato), spice (chilli); medicine (belladonna, ashwagandha); fumigatory (tobacco); ornamentals (petunia).\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\nFlowering plants exhibit enormous variation in shape, size, structure, mode of nutrition, life span, habit and habitat. They have well developed root and shoot systems. Root system is either tap root or fibrous. Generally, dicotyledonous plants have tap roots while monocotyledonous plants have fibrous roots. The roots in some plants get modified for storage of food, mechanical support and respiration. The shoot system is differentiated into stem, leaves, flowers and fruits. The morphological features of stems like the presence of nodes and internodes, multicellular hair and positively phototropic nature help to differentiate the stems from roots. Leaf is a lateral outgrowth of stem developed exogeneously at the node. These are green in colour to perform the function of photosynthesis. Leaves exhibit marked variations in their shape, size, margin, apex and extent of incisions of leaf blade (lamina).\r\n\r\nThe flower is a modified shoot, meant for sexual reproduction. The flowers are arranged in different types of inflorescences. They exhibit enormous variation in structure, symmetry, position of ovary in relation to other parts, arrangement of petals, sepals, ovules etc. After fertilisation, the ovary is modified into fruits and ovules into seeds. Seeds either may be monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous. They vary in shape, size and period of viability. The floral characteristics form the basis of classification and identification of flowering plants. This can be illustrated through semi-technical descriptions of families. Hence, a flowering plant is described in a definite sequence by using scientific terms. The floral features are represented in the summarised form as floral diagrams and floral formula.\r\n\r\nEXERCISES\r\n1.

    "input": "ANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS CHAPTER 6 ANATOMY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 6.1 The Tissue System 6.2 Anatomy of Dicotyledonous and Monocotyledonous Plants You can very easily see the structural similarities and variations in the external morphology of the larger living organism, both plants and animals. Similarly, if we were to study the internal structure, one also finds several similarities as well as differences. This chapter introduces you to the internal structure and functional organisation of higher plants. Study of internal structure of plants is called anatomy. Plants have cells as the basic unit, cells are organised into tissues and in turn the tissues are organised into organs. Different organs in a plant show differences in their internal structure. Within angiosperms, the monocots and dicots are also seen to be anatomically different. Internal structures also show adaptations to diverse environments. 6.1 THE TISSUE SYSTEM We were discussing types of tissues based on the types of cells present. Let us now consider how tissues vary depending on their location in the plant body. Their structure and function would also be dependent on location. On the basis of their structure and location, there are three types of tissue systems. These are the epidermal tissue system, the ground or fundamental tissue system and the vascular or conducting tissue system. 6.1.1 Epidermal Tissue System The epidermal tissue system forms the outer-most covering of the whole plant body and comprises epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal appendages – the trichomes and hairs. The epidermis is the outermost layer of the primary plant body. It is made up of elongated, compactly arranged cells, which form a continuous layer. Epidermis is usually single-layered. Epidermal cells are parenchymatous with a small amount of cytoplasm lining the cell wall and a large vacuole. The outside of the epidermis is often covered with a waxy thick layer called the cuticle which prevents the loss of water. Cuticle is absent in roots. Stomata are structures present in the epidermis of leaves. Stomata regulate the process of transpiration and gaseous exchange. Each stoma is composed of two bean-shaped cells known as guard cells which enclose stomatal pore. In grasses, the guard cells are dumb-bell shaped. The outer walls of guard cells (away from the stomatal pore) are thin and the inner walls (towards the stomatal pore) are highly thickened. The guard cells possess chloroplasts and regulate the opening and closing of stomata. Sometimes, a few epidermal cells, in the vicinity of the guard cells become specialised in their shape and size and are known as subsidiary cells. The stomatal aperture, guard cells and the surrounding subsidiary cells are together called stomatal apparatus (Figure 6.1). Epidermal cells Subsidiary cells Chloroplast Guard cells Stomatal pore Figure 6.1 Diagrammatic representation: (a) stomata with bean-shaped guard cells (b) stomata with dumb-bell shaped guard cell The cells of epidermis bear a number of hairs. The root hairs are unicellular elongations of the epidermal cells and help absorb water and minerals from the soil. On the stem the epidermal hairs are called trichomes. The trichomes in the shoot system are usually multicellular. They may be branched or unbranched and soft or stiff. They may even be secretory. The trichomes help in preventing water loss due to transpiration. 6.1.2 The Ground Tissue System All tissues except epidermis and vascular bundles constitute the ground tissue. It consists of simple tissues such as parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma. Parenchymatous cells are usually present in cortex, pericycle, pith and medullary rays, in the primary stems and roots. In leaves, the ground tissue consists of thin-walled chloroplast containing cells and is called mesophyll. 6.1.3 The Vascular Tissue System The vascular system consists of complex tissues, the phloem and the xylem.The xylem and phloem together constitute vascular bundles (Figure 6.2). In dicotyledonous stems, cambium is present between phloem and xylem. Such vascular bundles because of the presence of cambium possess the ability to form secondary xylem and phloem tissues, and hence are called open vascular bundles. In the monocotyledons, the vascular bundles have no cambium present in them. Hence, since they do not form secondary tissues they are referred to as closed. When xylem and phloem within a vascular bundle are arranged in an alternate manner along the different radii, the arrangement is called radial such as in roots. In conjoint type of vascular bundles, the xylem and phloem are jointly situated along the same radius of vascular bundles. Such vascular bundles are common in stems and leaves. The conjoint vascular bundles usually have the phloem located only on the outer side of xylem. 6.2 ANATOMY OF DICOTYLEDONOUS AND MONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS For a better understanding of tissue organisation of roots, stems and leaves, it is convenient to study the transverse sections of the mature zones of these organs. 6.2.1 Dicotyledonous Root Look at Figure 6.3 (a), it shows the transverse section of the sunflower root. The internal tissue organisation is as follows: The outermost layer is epiblema. Many of the cells of epiblema protrude in the form of unicellular root hairs. The cortex consists of several layers of thin-walled parenchyma cells with intercellular spaces. The innermost layer of the cortex is called endodermis. It comprises a single layer of barrel-shaped cells without any intercellular spaces. The tangential as well as radial walls of the endodermal cells have a deposition of water-impermeable, waxy material suberin in the form of casparian strips. Next to endodermis lies a few layers of thick-walled parenchyomatous cells referred to as pericycle. Initiation of lateral roots and vascular cambium during the secondary growth takes place in these cells. The pith is small or inconspicuous. The parenchymatous cells which lie between the xylem and the phloem are called conjuctive tissue. There are usually two to four xylem and phloem patches. Later, a cambium ring develops between the xylem and phloem. All tissues on the innerside of the endodermis such as pericycle, vascular bundles and pith constitute the stele. 6.2.2 Monocotyledonous Root The anatomy of the monocot root is similar to the dicot root in many respects (Figure 6.3 b). It has epidermis, cortex, endodermis, pericycle, vascular bundles and pith. As compared to the dicot root which have fewer xylem bundles, there are usually more than six (polyarch) xylem bundles in the monocot root. Pith is large and well developed. Monocotyledonous roots do not undergo any secondary growth. 6.2.3 Dicotyledonous Stem The transverse section of a typical young dicotyledonous stem shows that the epidermis is the outermost protective layer of the stem (Figure 6.4 a). Covered with a thin layer of cuticle, it may bear trichomes and a few stomata. The cells arranged in multiple layers between epidermis and pericycle constitute the cortex. It consists of three sub-zones. The outer hypodermis, consists of a few layers of collenchymatous cells just below the epidermis, which provide mechanical strength to the young stem. Cortical layers below hypodermis consist of rounded thin walled parenchymatous cells with conspicuous intercellular spaces. The innermost layer of the cortex is called the endodermis. The cells of the endodermis are rich in starch grains and the layer is also referred to as the starch sheath. Pericycle is present on the inner side of the endodermis and above the phloem in the form of semi-lunar patches of sclerenchyma. In between the vascular bundles there are a few layers of radially placed parenchymatous cells, which constitute medullary rays. A large number of vascular bundles are arranged in a ring ; the 'ring' arrangement of vascular bundles is a characteristic of dicot stem. Each vascular bundle is conjoint, open, and with endarch protoxylem. A large number of rounded, parenchymatous cells with large intercellular spaces which occupy the central portion of the stem constitute the pith. 6.2.4 Monocotyledonous Stem The monocot stem has a sclerenchymatous hypodermis, a large number of scattered vascular bundles, each surrounded by a sclerenchymatous bundle sheath, and a large, conspicuous parenchymatous ground tissue (Figure 6.4 b). Vascular bundles are conjoint and closed. Peripheral vascular bundles are generally smaller than the centrally located ones. The phloem parenchyma is absent, and water-containing cavities are present within the vascular bundles. 6.2.5 Dorsiventral (Dicotyledonous) Leaf The vertical section of a dorsiventral leaf through the lamina shows three main parts, namely, epidermis, mesophyll and vascular system. The epidermis which covers both the upper surface (adaxial epidermis) and lower surface (abaxial epidermis) of the leaf has a conspicuous cuticle. The abaxial epidermis generally bears more stomata than the adaxial epidermis. The latter may even lack stomata. The tissue between the upper and the lower epidermis is called the mesophyll. Mesophyll, which possesses chloroplasts and carry out photosynthesis, is made up of parenchyma. It has two types of cells – the palisade parenchyma and the spongy parenchyma. The adaxially placed palisade parenchyma is made up of elongated cells, which are arranged vertically and parallel to each other. The oval or round and loosely arranged spongy parenchyma is situated below the palisade cells and extends to the lower epidermis. There are numerous large spaces and air cavities between these cells. Vascular system includes vascular bundles, which can be seen in the veins and the midrib. The size of the vascular bundles are dependent on the size of the veins. The veins vary in thickness in the reticulate venation of the dicot leaves. The vascular bundles are surrounded by a layer of thick walled bundle sheath cells. Look at Figure 6.5 (a) and find the position of xylem in the vascular bundle. 6.2.6 Isobilateral (Monocotyledonous) Leaf The anatomy of isobilateral leaf is similar to that of the dorsiventral leaf in many ways. It shows the following characteristic differences. In an isobilateral leaf, the stomata are present on both the surfaces of the epidermis; and the mesophyll is not differentiated into palisade and spongy parenchyma (Figure 6.5 b). In grasses, certain adaxial epidermal cells along the veins modify themselves into large, empty, colourless cells. These are called bulliform cells. When the bulliform cells in the leaves have absorbed water and are turgid, the leaf surface is exposed. When they are flaccid due to water stress, they make the leaves curl inwards to minimise water loss. The parallel venation in monocot leaves is reflected in the near similar sizes of vascular bundles (except in main veins) as seen in vertical sections of the leaves. SUMMARY Anatomically, a plant is made of different kinds of tissues. The plant tissues are broadly classified into meristematic (apical, lateral and intercalary) and permanent (simple and complex). Assimilation of food and its storage, transportation of water, minerals and photosynthates, and mechanical support are the main functions of tissues. There are three types of tissue systems – epidermal, ground and vascular. The epidermal tissue systems are made of epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal appendages. The ground tissue system forms the main bulk of the plant. It is divided into three zones – cortex, pericycle and pith. The vascular tissue system is formed by the xylem and phloem. On the basis of presence of cambium, location of xylem and phloem, the vascular bundles are of different types. The vascular bundles form the conducting tissue and translocate water, minerals and food material. Monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants show marked variation in their internal structures. They differ in type, number and location of vascular bundles. The secondary growth occurs in most of the dicotyledonous roots and stems. EXERCISES 1. Draw illustrations to bring out the anatomical difference between (a) Monocot root and Dicot root (b) Monocot stem and Dicot stem 2.

    "input": "STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS79In the preceding chapters you came across a large variety of organisms,both unicellular and multicellular, of the animal kingdom. In unicellularorganisms, all functions like digestion, respiration and reproductionare performed by a single cell. In the complex body of multicellular\nanimals the same basic functions are carried out by different groups ofcells in a well organised manner. The body of a simple organism likeHydra is made of different types of cells and the number of cells in eachtype can be in thousands. The human body is composed of billions ofcells to perform various functions. How do these cells in the body worktogether? As you have already learnt in your earlier classes, inmulticellular animals, a group of similar cells alongwith intercellular\nsubstances perform a specific function. Such an organisation is called\ntissue.You may be surprised to know that all complex animals consist ofonly four basic types of tissues. These tissues are organised in specific\nproportion and pattern to form an organ like stomach, lung, heart and\nkidney. When two or more organs perform a common function by theirphysical and/or chemical interaction, they together form organ system,e.g., digestive system, respiratory system, etc. Cells, tissues, organs and\norgan systems split up the work in a way that exhibits division of labour\nand contribute to the survival of the body as a whole.7.1ORGAN AND ORGAN SYSTEMThe basic tissues as you have learnt in earlier classes, organise to formorgans which in turn associate to form organ systems in the multicellular\norganisms. Such an organisation is essential for more efficient and better\ncoordinated activities of millions of cells constituting an organism. EachSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION INANIMALSCHAPTER  77.1Organ and OrganSystem7.2Frogs80BIOLOGYorgan in our body is made of one or more type of tissues. For example,our heart consists of all the four types of tissues, i.e., epithelial, connective,muscular and neural. We also notice, after some careful study that thecomplexity in organ and organ systems displays certain discernable trend.This discernable trend is called evolutionary trend (You will study thedetails in class XII). In this chapter, you are being introduced tomorphology and anatomy of frog. Morphology refers to study of form or\nexternally visible features. In the case of plants or microbes, the term\nmorphology precisely means only this. In case of animals this refers to\nthe external appearance of the organs or parts of the body. The wordanatomy conventionally is used for the study of morphology of internalorgans in the animals. You will learn the morphology and anatomy offrog representing vertebrates.7.2FROGSFrogs can live both on land and in freshwater and belong to class Amphibiaof phylum Chordata. The most common species of frog found in India is\nRana tigrina.They do not have constant body temperature i.e., their bodytemperature varies with the temperature of the environment. Such animals\nare called cold blooded or poikilotherms. You might have also noticedchanges in the colour of the frogs while they are in grasses and on dry\nland. They have the ability to change the colour to hide them from theirenemies (camouflage). This protective coloration is called mimicry.  Youmay also know that frogs are not seen during peak summer and winter.During this period they take shelter in deep burrows to protect themfrom extreme heat and cold. This is known as summer sleep (aestivation)and winter sleep (hibernation) respectively.7.2.1 MorphologyHave you ever touched the skin of frog? The skin is smooth and slipperydue to the presence of mucus. The skin is always maintained in a moistcondition. The colour of dorsal side of body isgenerally olive green with dark irregular spots.  Onthe ventral side the skin is uniformly pale yellow.\nThe frog never drinks water but absorb it through\nthe skin.Body of a frog is divisible into head and trunk(Figure 7.1). A neck and tail are absent. Above the\nmouth, a pair of nostrils is present.  Eyes are bulged\nand covered by a nictitating membrane thatprotects them while in water. On either side of eyesa membranous tympanum (ear) receives soundsignals. The forelimbs and hind limbs help inFigure 7.1  External features of frogEyeFore limbHind limbHeadTrunkSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS81swimming, walking, leaping and burrowing. The hind limbs end in fivedigits and they are larger and muscular than fore limbs that end in fourdigits. Feet have webbed digits that help in swimming. Frogs exhibit sexualdimorphism. Male frogs can be distinguished by the presence of sound\nproducing vocal sacs and also a copulatory pad on the first digit of the\nfore limbs which are absent in female frogs.7.2.2AnatomyThe body cavity of frogs accommodate different organ systems such asdigestive, circulatory, respiratory, nervous, excretory and reproductive\nsystems with well developed structures and functions  (Figure 7.2).The digestive system consists of alimentary canal and digestive glands.The alimentary canal is short because frogs are carnivores and hence thelength of intestine is reduced. The mouth opens into the buccal cavity thatleads to the oesophagus through pharynx. Oesophagus is a short tubethat opens into the stomach which in turn continues as the intestine, rectumand finally opens outside by the cloaca.  Liver secretes bile that is stored inthe gall bladder. Pancreas, a digestive gland produces pancreatic juiceFigure 7.2Diagrammatic representation of internal organs of frog showingcomplete digestive systemIntestineUreterRectumCloacaUrinarybladderOesophagusLiverStomachKidneyGallbladderFat bodiesLungHeartCloacal Aperture82BIOLOGYcontaining digestive enzymes. Food is captured by the bilobed tongue.Digestion of food takes place by the action of HCl and gastric juices secretedfrom  the walls of the stomach. Partially digested food called chyme is passedfrom stomach to the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. Theduodenum receives bile from gall bladder and pancreatic juices from thepancreas through a common bile duct. Bile emulsifies fat and pancreaticjuices digest carbohydrates and proteins. Final digestion takes place in theintestine. Digested food is absorbed by the numerous finger-like folds inthe inner wall of intestine called villi and microvilli. The undigested solid\nwaste moves into the rectum and passes out through cloaca.Frogs respire on land and in the water by two different methods. Inwater, skin acts as aquatic respiratory organ (cutaneous respiration).Dissolved oxygen in the water is exchanged through the skin by diffusion.\nOn land, the buccal cavity, skin and lungs act as the respiratory organs.The respiration by lungs is called pulmonary respiration. The lungs are apair of elongated, pink coloured sac-like structures present in the upperpart of the trunk region (thorax). Air enters through the nostrils into thebuccal cavity and then to lungs. During aestivation and hibernationgaseous exchange takes place through skin.The vascular system of frog is well-developed closed type. Frogs havea lymphatic system also. The blood vascular system involves heart, bloodvessels and blood. The lymphatic system consists of lymph, lymphchannels and lymph nodes. Heart is a muscular structure situated in theupper part of the body cavity. It has three chambers, two atria and one\nventricle and is covered by a membrane called pericardium. A triangularstructure called sinus venosus joins the right atrium. It receives bloodthrough the major veins called vena cava. The ventricle opens into a sac-like conus arteriosus on the ventral side of the heart. The blood from theheart is carried to all parts of the body by the arteries (arterial system).The veins collect blood from different parts of body to the heart and formthe venous system. Special venous connection between liver and intestineas well as the kidney and lower parts of the body are present in frogs. Theformer is called hepatic portal system and the latter is called renal portalsystem. The blood is composed of plasma and cells. The blood cells areRBC (red blood cells) or erythrocytes, WBC (white blood cells) or leucocytesand platelets. RBC’s are nucleated and contain red coloured pigmentnamely haemoglobin. The lymph is different from blood. It lacks fewproteins and RBCs. The blood carries nutrients, gases and water to therespective sites during the circulation. The circulation of blood is achievedby the pumping action of the muscular heart.The elimination of nitrogenous wastes is carried out by a welldeveloped excretory system. The excretory system consists of a pair ofkidneys, ureters, cloaca and urinary bladder. These are compact, darkred and bean like structures situated a little posteriorly in the body cavity\non both sides of vertebral column. Each kidney is composed of severalstructural and functional units called uriniferous tubules or nephrons.Two ureters emerge from the kidneys in the male frogs. The ureters act asurinogenital duct which opens into the cloaca. In females the ureters andSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION IN ANIMALS83oviduct open seperately in the cloaca. The thin-walled urinary bladder ispresent ventral to the rectum which also opens in the cloaca. The frogexcretes urea and thus is a ureotelic animal. Excretory wastes are carriedby blood into the kidney where it is separated and excreted.The system for control and coordination is highly evolved in the frog. Itincludes both neural system and endocrine glands. The chemical\ncoordination of various organs of the body isachieved by hormones which are secreted by theendocrine glands. The prominent endocrineglands found in frog are pituitary, thyroid,parathyroid, thymus, pineal body, pancreaticislets, adrenals and gonads. The nervous systemis organised into a central nervous system (brainand spinal cord), a peripheral nervous system(cranial and spinal nerves) and an autonomicnervous system (sympathetic andparasympathetic). There are ten pairs of cranialnerves arising from the brain. Brain is enclosedin a bony structure called brain box (cranium).The brain is divided into fore-brain, mid-brainand hind-brain. Forebrain includes olfactorylobes, paired cerebral hemispheres and unpaireddiencephalon. The midbrain is characterised bya pair of optic lobes. Hind-brain consists of\ncerebellum and medulla oblongata. The medullaoblongata passes out through the foramenmagnum and continues into spinal cord, whichis enclosed in the vertebral column.Frog has different types of sense organs, namelyorgans of touch (sensory papillae), taste (tastebuds), smell (nasal epithelium), vision (eyes) andhearing (tympanum with internal ears). Out ofthese, eyes and internal ears are well-organisedstructures and the rest are cellular aggregationsaround nerve endings. Eyes in a frog are a pair ofspherical structures situated in the orbit in skull.These are simple eyes (possessing only one unit).External ear is absent in frogs and only tympanumcan be seen externally. The ear is an organ ofhearing as well as balancing (equilibrium).Frogs have well organised male and femalereproductive systems. Male reproductive organsconsist of a pair of yellowish ovoid testes (Figure7.3), which are found adhered to the upper partof kidneys by a double fold of peritoneum calledmesorchium. Vasa efferentia are 10-12 innumber that arise from testes. They enter the\nkidneys on their side and open into Bidder’sFigure 7.3 Male reproductive systemFatbodiesKidneyUrinogenital ductCloacaCloacal\napertureTestisAdrenal\nglandUrinary\nbladderRectumVasaefferentiaFigure 7.4 Female reproductive systemOviductOvaryOvaUreterCloacaCloacal apertureUrinarybladder84BIOLOGYcanal. Finally it communicates with the urinogenital duct that comes outof the kidneys and opens into the cloaca. The cloaca is a small, medianchamber that is used to pass faecal matter, urine and sperms to the exterior.The female reproductive organs include a pair of ovaries (Figure 7.4).The ovaries are situated near kidneys and there is no functional connectionwith kidneys. A pair of oviduct arising from the ovaries opens into thecloaca separately. A mature female can lay 2500 to 3000 ova at a time.Fertilisation is external and takes place in water. Development involves alarval stage called tadpole. Tadpole undergoes metamorphosis to form\nthe adult.Frogs are beneficial for mankind because they eat insects and protectthe crop. Frogs maintain ecological balance because these serve as animportant link of food chain and food web in the ecosystem. In somecountries the muscular legs of frog are used as food by man.SUMMARYCells, tissues, organs and organ systems split up the work in a way that\nensures the survival of the body as a whole and exhibit division of labour.A tissue is defined as group of cells along with intercellular substances\nperforming one or more functions in the body. Epithelia are sheet like\ntissues lining the body’s surface and its cavities, ducts and tubes. Epitheliahave one free surface facing a body fluid or the outside environment.Their cells are structurally and functionally connected at junctions.The Indian bullfrog, Rana tigrina, is the common frog found in India.Body is covered by skin. Mucous glands are present in the skin which ishighly vascularised and helps in respiration in water and on land. Body isdivisible into head and trunk. A muscular tongue is present, which is bilobedat the tip and is used in capturing the prey. The alimentary canal consistsof oesophagous, stomach, intestine and rectum, which open into the cloaca.The main digestive glands are liver and pancreas. It can respire in waterthrough skin and through lungs on land. Circulatory system is closedwith single circulation. RBCs are nucleated. Nervous system is organisedinto central, peripheral and autonomic. The organs of urinogenital systemare kidneys and urinogenital ducts, which open into the cloaca. The malereproductive organ is a pair of testes. The female reproductive organ is apair of ovaries. A female lays 2500-3000 ova at a time. The fertilisation anddevelopment are external. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, whichmetamorphose into frogs.EXERCISES1.Draw a neat diagram of digestive system of frog.2.Mention the function of the Ureters in frog.",

    "input": "UNIT 3Biology is the study of living organisms. The detailed description oftheir form and appearance only brought out their diversity. It is theccell theory that emphasised the unity underlying this diversity of forms,ci.e., the cellular organisation of all life forms. A description of cellcstructure and cell growth by division is given in the chapters comprisingcthis unit. Cell theory also created a sense of mystery around livingcphenomena, i.e., physiological and behavioural processes. This mysterycwas the requirement of integrity of cellular organisation for livingcphenomena to be demonstrated or observed. In studying andcunderstanding the physiological and behavioural processes, one canctake a physico-chemical approach and use cell-free systems tocinvestigate. This approach enables us to describe the various processescin molecular terms. The approach is established by analysis of livingctissues for elements and compounds. It will tell us what types of organicccompounds are present in living organisms. In the next stage, one cancask the question: What are these compounds doing inside a cell? And,cin what way they carry out gross physiological processes like digestion,cexcretion, memory, defense, recognition, etc. In other words we answercthe question, what is the molecular basis of all physiological processes?cIt can also explain the abnormal processes that occur during anycdiseased condition. This physico-chemical approach to study andcunderstand living organisms is called ‘Reductionist Biology’. Thecconcepts and techniques of physics and chemistry are applied tounderstand biology. In Chapter 9 of this unit, a brief description ofbiomolecules is provided.CELL: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONSChapter 8cCell: The Unit of LifeChapter 9BiomoleculesChapter 10Cell Cycle andcCell Division2024-25G.N. RAMACHANDRAN, an outstanding figure in the field of proteinstructure, was the founder of the ‘Madras school’ ofconformational analysis of biopolymers. His discovery of the triplechelical structure of collagen published in Nature in 1954 and hisanalysis of the allowed conformations of proteins through thecuse of the ‘Ramachandran plot’ rank among the most outstandingccontributions in structural biology. He was born on October 8,c1922, in a small town, not far from Cochin on the southwesternccoast of India. His father was a professor of mathematics at aclocal college and thus had considerable influence in shapingcRamachandran’s interest in mathematics. After completing hiscschool years, Ramachandran graduated in 1942 as the top-cranking student in the B.Sc. (Honors) Physics course of thecUniversity of Madras. He received a Ph.D. from CambridgecUniversity in 1949. While at Cambridge, Ramachandran metcLinus Pauling and was deeply influenced by his publications oncmodels of the α-helix and β-sheet structures that directed hisattention to solving the structure of collagen. He passed away atcthe age of 78, on April 7, 2001.G.N. Ramachandran(1922 – 2001)2024-25When you look around, you see both living and non-living things. Youmust have wondered and asked yourself – ‘what is it that makes anorganism living, or what is it that an inanimate thing does not have whicha living thing has’ ? The answer to this is the presence of the basic unit ofclife – the cell in all living organisms.All organisms are composed of cells. Some are composed of a singlecell and are called unicellular organisms while others, like us, composedof many cells, are called multicellular organisms.8.1WHAT IS A CELL?Unicellular organisms are capable of (i) independent existence and(ii) performing the essential functions of life. Anything less than a completestructure of a cell does not ensure independent living. Hence, cell is thefundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms.Anton Von Leeuwenhoek first saw and described a live cell. RobertBrown later discovered the nucleus. The invention of the microscope andcits improvement leading to the electron microscope revealed all thecstructural details of the cell.8.2CELL THEORYIn 1838, Matthias Schleiden, a German botanist, examined a large numberof plants and observed that all plants are composed of different kinds ofccells which form the tissues of the plant. At about the same time, TheodoreCELL: THE UNIT OF LIFECHAPTER  88.1What is a Cell?8.2Cell Theory8.3An Overview ofCell8.4Prokaryotic Cells8.5Eukaryotic Cells2024-2588BIOLOGYSchwann (1839), a British Zoologist, studied different types of animal cellsand reported that cells had a thin outer layer which is today known as the‘plasma membrane’. He also concluded, based on his studies on plantctissues, that the presence of cell wall is a unique character of the plantcells. On the basis of this, Schwann proposed the hypothesis that the bodiesof animals and plants are composed of cells and products of cells.Schleiden and Schwann together formulated the cell theory. This theoryhowever, did not explain as to how new cells were formed. Rudolf Virchow(1855) first explained that cells divided and new cells are formed fromcpre-existing cells (Omnis cellula-e cellula). He modified the hypothesis ofSchleiden and Schwann to give the cell theory a final shape. Cell theorycas understood today is:(i)all living organisms are composed of cells and products of cells.(ii)all cells arise from pre-existing cells.8.3AN OVERVIEW OF CELLYou have earlier observed cells in an onion peel and/or human cheekcells under the microscope. Let us recollect their structure. The onion cellwhich is a typical plant cell, has a distinct cell wall as its outer boundaryand just within it is the cell membrane. The cells of the human cheekchave an outer membrane as the delimiting structure of the cell. Insideeach cell is a dense membrane bound structure called nucleus. Thisnucleus contains the chromosomes which in turn contain the geneticcmaterial, DNA. Cells that have membrane bound nuclei are calledeukaryotic whereas cells that lack a membrane bound nucleus areprokaryotic. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, a semi-fluid matrixccalled cytoplasm occupies the volume of the cell. The cytoplasm is themain arena of cellular activities in both the plant and animal cells. Variouschemical reactions occur in it to keep the cell in the ‘living state’.Besides the nucleus, the eukaryotic cells have other membrane bounddistinct structures called organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),the golgi complex, lysosomes, mitochondria, microbodies and vacuoles.The prokaryotic cells lack such membrane bound organelles.Ribosomes are non-membrane bound organelles found in all cells –both eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic. Within the cell, ribosomes arecfound not only in the cytoplasm but also within the two organelles –chloroplasts (in plants) and mitochondria and on rough ER.Animal cells contain another non-membrane bound organelle calledcentrosome which helps in cell division.Cells differ greatly in size, shape and activities (Figure 8.1). For example,Mycoplasmas, the smallest cells, are only 0.3 µm in length while bacteria2024-25CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE89Red blood cells(round and biconcave)White blood cells(Branched and long)Columnar epithelial cells(long and narrow)(amoeboid)Nerve cellMesophyll cells(round and oval)A tracheid(elongated)Figure 8.1 Diagram showing different shapes of the cellscould be 3 to 5 µm. The largest isolated single cell is the egg of an ostrich.Among multicellular organisms, human red blood cells are about 7.0µm in diameter. Nerve cells are some of the longest cells. Cells also varygreatly in their shape. They may be disc-like, polygonal, columnar, cuboid,thread like, or even irregular. The shape of the cell may vary with thefunction they perform.8.4PROKARYOTIC CELLSThe prokaryotic cells are represented by bacteria, blue-green algae,mycoplasma and PPLO (Pleuro Pneumonia Like Organisms). They aregenerally smaller and multiply more rapidly than the eukaryotic cellsc(Figure 8.2). They may vary greatly in shape and size. The four basicshapes of bacteria are bacillus (rod like), coccus (spherical), vibrio (commashaped) and spirillum (spiral).The organisation of the prokaryotic cell is fundamentally similar eventhough prokaryotes exhibit a wide variety of shapes and functions. All2024-2590BIOLOGYprokaryotes have a cell wall surrounding thecell membrane except in mycoplasma. The fluidmatrix filling the cell is the cytoplasm. There iscno well-defined nucleus. The genetic material isbasically naked, not enveloped by a nuclearmembrane. In addition to the genomic DNA (thecsingle chromosome/circular DNA), manybacteria have small circular DNA outside thegenomic DNA. These smaller DNA are calledcplasmids. The plasmid DNA confers certainunique phenotypic characters to such bacteria.One such character is resistance to antibiotics.cIn higher classes you will learn that this plasmidDNA is used to monitor bacterial transformationwith foreign DNA. Nuclear membrane is foundcin eukaryotes. No organelles, like the ones ineukaryotes, are found in prokaryotic cells exceptfor ribosomes. Prokaryotes have somethingcunique in the form of inclusions. A specialiseddifferentiated form of cell membrane called mesosome is the characteristiccof prokaryotes. They are essentially infoldings of cell membrane.8.4.1Cell Envelope and its ModificationsMost prokaryotic cells, particularly the bacterial cells, have a chemicallycomplex cell envelope. The cell envelope consists of a tightly bound threelayered structure i.e., the outermost glycocalyx followed by the cell wall andcthen the plasma membrane. Although each layer of the envelope performsdistinct function, they act together as a single protective unit. Bacteria canbe classified into two groups on the basis of the differences in the cell envelopesand the manner in which they respond to the staining procedure developedby Gram viz., those that take up the gram stain are Gram positive and theothers that do not are called Gram negative bacteria.Glycocalyx differs in composition and thickness among differentbacteria. It could be a loose sheath called the slime layer in some, whilein others it may be thick and tough, called the capsule. The cell walldetermines the shape of the cell and provides a strong structural supportcto prevent the bacterium from bursting or collapsing.The plasma membrane is selectively permeable in nature and interactswith the outside world. This membrane is similar structurally to that ofcthe eukaryotes.A special membranous structure is the mesosome which is formedby the extensions of plasma membrane into the cell. These extensions arecin the form of vesicles, tubules and lamellae. They help in cell wallTypical bacteria(1-2m)\u001fPPLO(about 0.1m)\u001fViruses(0.02-0.2m)\u001fA typical eukaryotic cell(10-20m)\u001fFigure 8.2Diagram showing comparison ofeukaryotic cell with otherorganisms2024-25CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE91formation, DNA replication and distribution to daughter cells. They alsohelp in respiration, secretion processes, to increase the surface area ofthe plasma membrane and enzymatic content. In some prokaryotes likeccyanobacteria, there are other membranous extensions into the cytoplasmcalled chromatophores which contain pigments.Bacterial cells may be motile or non-motile. If motile, they have thinfilamentous extensions from their cell wall called flagella. Bacteria show acrange in the number and arrangement of flagella. Bacterial flagellum iscomposed of three parts – filament, hook and basal body. The filamentis the longest portion and extends from the cell surface to the outside.Besides flagella, Pili and Fimbriae are also surface structures of thebacteria but do not play a role in motility. The pili are elongated tubularstructures made of a special protein. The fimbriae are small bristle likefibres sprouting out of the cell. In some bacteria, they are known to helpcattach the bacteria  to rocks in streams and also to the host tissues.8.4.2Ribosomes and Inclusion BodiesIn prokaryotes, ribosomes are associated with the plasma membrane ofcthe cell. They are about 15 nm by 20 nm in size and are made of twocsubunits - 50S and 30S units which when present together form 70Sprokaryotic ribosomes. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Severalribosomes may attach to a single mRNA and form a chain calledHpolyribosomes or polysome. The ribosomes of a polysome translate themRNA into proteins.Inclusion bodies: Reserve material in prokaryotic cells are stored inthe cytoplasm in the form of inclusion bodies. These are not bound byany membrane system and lie free in the cytoplasm, e.g., phosphategranules, cyanophycean granules and glycogen granules. Gas vacuolescare found in blue green and purple and green photosynthetic bacteria.8.5EUKARYOTIC CELLSThe eukaryotes include all the protists, plants, animals and fungi. Inceukaryotic cells there is an extensive compartmentalisation of cytoplasmcthrough the presence of membrane bound organelles. Eukaryotic cellspossess an organised nucleus with a nuclear envelope. In addition,eukaryotic cells have a variety of complex locomotory and cytoskeletalcstructures. Their genetic material is organised into chromosomes.All eukaryotic cells are not identical. Plant and animal cells are differentas the former possess cell walls, plastids and a large central vacuole whichcare absent in animal cells. On the other hand, animal cells have centrioleswhich are absent in almost all plant cells (Figure 8.3).2024-2592BIOLOGYRough endoplasmicreticulumLysosomeSmoothendoplasmicreticulumPlasmodesmataMicrotubuleNucleusNucleolusGolgiapparatusNuclearenvelopeVacuoleMiddle lamellaPlasmamembraneCell wallMitochondrionRibosomesChloroplastCytoplasmPeroxisomeFigure 8.3 Diagram showing : (a) Plant cell  (b) Animal cellGolgiapparatusSmoothendoplasmicreticulumNuclearenvelopeNucleolusNucleusMicrovilliPlasmamembraneCentriolePeroxiomeLysosomeRibosomesMitochondrionRoughendoplasmicreticulumCytoplasm(a)(b)2024-25CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE93CholesterolSugarPeripheral ProteinPhospholipidbilayerLet us now look at individual cell organelles to understand theirstructure and functions.8.5.1 Cell MembraneThe detailed structure of the membrane was studied only after the adventof the electron microscope in the 1950s. Meanwhile, chemical studies onthe cell membrane, especially in human red blood cells (RBCs), enabledthe scientists to deduce the possible structure of plasma membrane.These studies showed that the cell membrane is mainly composed oflipids and proteins. The major lipids are phospholipids that are arrangedcin a bilayer. Also, the lipids are arranged within the membrane with thepolar head towards the outer sides and the hydrophobic tails towardsthe inner part.This ensures that the nonpolar tail of saturatedhydrocarbons is protected from the aqueous environment (Figure 8.4).cIn addition to phospholipids membrane also contains cholesterol.Later, biochemical investigation clearly revealed that the cell membranesalso possess protein and carbohydrate. The ratio of protein and lipid variescconsiderably in different cell types. In human beings, the  membrane of theerythrocyte has approximately 52 per cent protein and 40 per cent lipids.Depending on the ease of extraction, membrane proteins can beclassified as integral and peripheral. Peripheral proteins lie on the surfacecof membrane while the integral proteins are partially or totally buried inthe membrane.Figure 8.4 Fluid mosaic model of plasma membrane2024-2594BIOLOGYAn improved model of  the structure of cell membrane was proposedby Singer and Nicolson (1972) widely accepted as fluid mosaic model(Figure 8.4). According to this, the quasi-fluid nature of lipid enableslateral movement of proteins within the overall bilayer. This ability to movewithin the membrane is measured as its fluidity.The fluid nature of the membrane is also important from the point ofview of functions like cell growth, formation of intercellular junctions,secretion, endocytosis, cell division etc.One of the most important functions of the plasma membrane is thetransport of the molecules across it. The membrane is selectively permeablecto some molecules present on either side of it. Many molecules can movebriefly across the membrane without any requirement of energy and thiscis called the passive transport. Neutral solutes may move across themembrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentrationcgradient, i.e., from higher concentration to the lower. Water may also moveacross this membrane from higher to lower concentration. Movement ofwater by diffusion is called osmosis. As the polar molecules cannot passthrough the nonpolar lipid bilayer, they require a carrier protein of themembrane to facilitate their transport across the membrane. A few ionscor molecules are transported across the membrane against theirconcentration gradient, i.e., from lower to the higher concentration. Suchca transport is an energy dependent process, in which ATP is utilised andis called active transport, e.g., Na+/K+ Pump.8.5.2Cell WallAs you may recall, a non-living rigid structure called the cell wall formsan outer covering for the plasma membrane of fungi and plants. Cell wallnot only gives shape to the cell and protects the cell from mechanicaldamage and infection, it also helps in cell-to-cell interaction and providescbarrier to undesirable macromolecules. Algae have cell wall, made ofcellulose, galactans, mannans and minerals like calcium carbonate, whilein other plants it consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and proteins.cThe cell wall of a young plant cell, the primary wall is capable of growth,which gradually diminishes as the cell matures and the secondary wall iscformed on the inner (towards membrane) side of the cell.The middle lamella is a layer mainly of calcium pectate which holdsor glues the different neighbouring cells together. The cell wall and middlelamellae may be traversed by plasmodesmata which connect the cytoplasmcof neighbouring cells.8.5.3Endomembrane SystemWhile each of the membranous organelles is distinct in terms of its2024-25CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE95NucleusNuclear poreRoughRibosomeendoplasmicEndoplasmicreticulumSmoothreticulumstructure and function, many of these areconsidered together as an endomembrane systembecause their functions are coordinated. Theendomembrane system include endoplasmiccreticulum (ER), golgi complex, lysosomes andvacuoles. Since the functions of the mitochondria,chloroplast and peroxisomes are not coordinatedcwith the above components, these are notconsidered as part of the endomembrane system.8.5.3.18.5.3.18.5.3.18.5.3.18.5.3.1The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)Electron microscopic studies of eukaryotic cellsreveal the presence of a network or reticulum oftiny tubular structures scattered in the cytoplasmthat is called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)c(Figure 8.5).  Hence, ER divides the intracellularspace into two distinct compartments, i.e., luminal(inside ER) and extra luminal (cytoplasm)ccompartments.The ER often shows ribosomes attached totheir outer surface. The endoplasmic reticuluncbearing ribosomes on their surface is called roughendoplasmic reticulum (RER). In the absence ofribosomes they appear smooth and are calledcsmooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER).RER is frequently observed in the cells activelyinvolved in protein synthesis and secretion. Theycare extensive and continuous with the outermembrane of the nucleus.The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the majorsite for synthesis of lipid. In animal cells lipid-likecsteroidal hormones are synthesised in SER.8.5.3.28.5.3.28.5.3.28.5.3.28.5.3.2Golgi apparatusGolgi apparatusGolgi apparatusGolgi apparatusGolgi apparatusCamillo Golgi (1898) first observed densely stainedreticular structures near the nucleus. These werelater named Golgi bodies after him. They consistof many flat, disc-shaped sacs or cisternae ofc0.5µm to 1.0µm diameter (Figure 8.6). These arestacked parallel to each other. Varied number ofcisternae are present in a Golgi complex. The Golgiccisternae are concentrically arranged near thenucleus with distinct convex cis or the formingFigure 8.5 Endoplasmic reticulumCisternaeFigure 8.6  Golgi apparatus2024-2596BIOLOGYface and concave trans or the maturing face.The cis and the trans faces of the organelle are entirely different, butinterconnected.The golgi apparatus principally performs the function of packagingmaterials, to be delivered either to the intra-cellular targets or secretedoutside the cell. Materials to be packaged in the form of vesicles fromcthe ER fuse with the cis face of the golgi apparatus and move towardsthe maturing face. This explains, why the golgi apparatus remains incclose association with the endoplasmic reticulum. A number of proteinscsynthesised by ribosomes on the endoplasmic reticulum are modifiedin the cisternae of the golgi apparatus before they are released from itstrans face. Golgi apparatus is the important site of formation ofglycoproteins and glycolipids.8.5.3.38.5.3.38.5.3.38.5.3.38.5.3.3LysosomesLysosomesLysosomesLysosomesLysosomesThese are membrane bound vesicular structures formed by the processof packaging in the golgi apparatus. The isolated lysosomal vesicleshave been found to be very rich in almost all types of hydrolyticenzymes (hydrolases – lipases, proteases, carbohydrases) optimallyactive at the acidic pH. These enzymes are capable of digestingcarbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids.8.5.3.48.5.3.48.5.3.48.5.3.48.5.3.4VacuolesVacuoles3VacuolesVacuolesVacuolesThe vacuole is the membrane-bound space found in the cytoplasm. It containswater, sap, excretory product and other materials not useful for the cell. Thevacuole is bound by a single membrane called tonoplast. In plant cells thevacuoles can occupy up to 90 per cent of the volume of the cell.In plants, the tonoplast facilitates the transport of a number of ionsand other materials against concentration gradients into the vacuole, hencectheir concentration is significantly higher in the vacuole than in thecytoplasm.In Amoeba the contractile vacuole is important for osmoregulationand excretion. In many cells, as in protists, food vacuoles are formed byengulfing the food particles.8.5.4MitochondriaMitochondria (sing.: mitochondrion), unless specifically stained, are noteasily visible under the microscope. The number of mitochondria per cellis variable depending on the physiological activity of the cells. In terms ofshape and size also, considerable degree of variability is observed. Typicallyit is sausage-shaped or cylindrical having a diameter of 0.2-1.0µm (average0.5µm) and length 1.0-4.1µm. Each mitochondrion is a double2024-25CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE97membrane-bound structure with the outer membrane and the innermembrane dividing its lumen distinctly into two aqueous compartments,i.e., the outer compartment and the inner compartment. The innercompartment is filled with a dense homogeneous substance called theHmatrix. The outer membrane forms the continuous limiting boundary ofthe organelle. The inner membrane forms a number of infoldings calledthe cristae (sing.: crista) towards the matrix (Figure 8.7). The cristaeincrease the surface area. The two membranes have their own specificcenzymes associated with the mitochondrial function. Mitochondria arethe sites of aerobic respiration. They produce cellular energy in the formof ATP, hence they are called ‘power houses’ of the cell. The matrix alsopossesses single circular DNA molecule, a few RNA molecules, ribosomes(70S) and the components required for the synthesis of proteins. Themitochondria divide by fission.8.5.5PlastidsPlastids are found in all plant cells and in euglenoides. These are easilyobserved under the microscope as they are large. They bear some specificpigments, thus imparting specific colours to the plants. Based on thectype of pigments plastids can be classified into chloroplasts,chromoplasts and leucoplasts.The chloroplasts contain chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments whichare responsible for trapping light energy essential for photosynthesis. Inthe chromoplasts fat soluble carotenoid pigments like carotene,xanthophylls and others are present. This gives the part of the plant ayellow, orange or red colour. The leucoplasts are the colourless plastidsof varied shapes and sizes with stored nutrients: Amyloplasts storecarbohydrates (starch), e.g., potato; elaioplasts store oils and fats whereasOutermembraneInnermembraneMatrixCristaFigure 8.7  Structure of mitochondrion (Longitudinal section)Inter-membranespace2024-2598BIOLOGYthe aleuroplasts store proteins.Majority of the chloroplasts of the greenplants are found in the mesophyll cells ofthe leaves. These are lens-shaped, oval,spherical, discoid or even ribbon-likeorganelles having variable length (5-10µm)cand width (2-4µm). Their number variesfrom 1 per cell of the Chlamydomonas, agreen alga to 20-40 per cell in the mesophyll.Like mitochondria, the chloroplasts arealso double membrane bound. Of the two,cthe  inner chloroplast membrane is relativelyless permeable. The space limited by theinner membrane of the chloroplast is called the stroma. A number of organisedflattened membranous sacs called the thylakoids, are present in the stroma(Figure 8.8). Thylakoids are arranged in stacks  like the piles of coins calledcgrana (singular: granum) or the intergranal thylakoids. In addition, there areflat membranous tubules called the stroma lamellae connecting the thylakoidscof the different grana. The membrane of the thylakoids enclose a space calleda lumen. The stroma of the chloroplast contains enzymes required for thesynthesis of carbohydrates and proteins. It also contains small, double-stranded circular DNA molecules and ribosomes. Chlorophyll pigments arepresent in the thylakoids. The ribosomes of the chloroplasts are smaller (70S)than the cytoplasmic ribosomes (80S).8.5.6RibosomesRibosomes are the granular structures first observed under the electronmicroscope as dense particles by George Palade (1953). They arecomposed of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins andare not surrounded by any membrane.The eukaryotic ribosomes are 80S while theprokaryotic ribosomes are 70S. Each ribosome has twosubunits, larger and smaller subunits (Fig 8.9). The twosubunits of 80S ribosomes are 60S and 40S while thatof 70S ribosomes are 50S and 30S. Here ‘S’ (Svedberg’sUnit) stands for the sedimentation coefficient; it isindirectly a measure of density and size. Both 70S and80S ribosomes are composed of two subunits.Figure 8.8  Sectional view of chloroplastFigure 8.9 Ribosome8.5.7CytoskeletonAn elaborate network of filamentous proteinaceous structures consistingof microtubules, microfilaments and intermediate filaments present inthe cytoplasm is collectively referred to as the cytoskeleton. Thecytoskeleton  in a cell are involved in many functions such as mechanicalsupport, motility, maintenance of the shape of the cell.2024-25CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE998.5.8Cilia and FlagellaCilia (sing.: cilium) and flagella (sing.: flagellum) are hair-like outgrowthsof the cell membrane.  Cilia are small structures which work like oars,causing the movement of either the cell or the surrounding fluid. Flagellacare comparatively longer and responsible for cell movement. Theprokaryotic bacteria also possess flagella but these are structurallydifferent from that of the eukaryotic flagella.The electron microscopic study of a cilium or the flagellum show thatthey are covered with plasma membrane. Their core called the axoneme,possesses a number of microtubules running parallel to the long axis.cThe axoneme usually has nine doublets of radially arranged peripheralmicrotubules, and a pair of centrally located microtubules. Such anarrangement of axonemal microtubules is referred to as the 9+2 arrayc(Figure 8.10). The central tubules are connected by bridges and is alsoenclosed by a central sheath, which is connected to one of the tubules ofeach peripheral doublets by a radial spoke. Thus, there are nine radialcspokes. The peripheral doublets are also interconnected by linkers. Boththe cilium and flagellum emerge from centriole-like structure called thebasal bodies.8.5.9Centrosome and CentriolesCentrosome is an organelle usually containing two cylindrical structurescalled centrioles. They are surrounded by amorphous pericentriolarcmaterials. Both the centrioles in a centrosome lie perpendicular to eachcother in which each has an organisation like the cartwheel. They arePlasmamembranePeripheralgmicrotubulesg(doublets)InterdoubletgbridgeCentralgmicrotubleRadialspokeCentralsheathFigure 8.10Section of cilia/flagella showing different parts : (a) Electron micrograph(b) Diagrammatic representation of internal structure(a)(b)2024-25100BIOLOGYmade up of nine evenly spaced peripheral fibrils of tubulin protein. Eachof the peripheral fibril is a triplet.The adjacent triplets are also linked.The central part of the proximal region of the centriole is also proteinaceousand called the hub, which is connected with tubules of the peripheraltriplets by radial spokes made of protein. The centrioles form the basalbody of cilia or flagella, and spindle fibres that give rise to spindleapparatus during cell division in animal cells.8.5.10NucleusNucleus as a cell organelle was first described by Robert Brown as earlycas 1831. Later the material of the nucleus stained by the basic dyes wascgiven the name chromatin by Flemming.The interphase nucleus (nucleus of acell when it is not dividing) has highlycextended and elaborate nucleoproteinfibres called chromatin, nuclear matrixand one or more spherical bodies calledHnucleoli (sing.: nucleolus) (Figure 8.11).Electron microscopy has revealed that thecnuclear envelope, which consists of twocparallel membranes with a space between(10 to 50 nm) called the perinuclearspace, forms a barrier between thematerials present inside the nucleus andcthat of the cytoplasm. The outermembrane usually remains continuouscwith the endoplasmic reticulum and alsobears ribosomes on it. At a number ofplaces the nuclear envelope is interrupted by minute pores, which areformed by the fusion of its two membranes. These nuclear pores are thepassages through which movement of RNA and protein molecules takesplace in both directions between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Normally,cthere is only one nucleus per cell, variations in the number of nuclei arealso frequently observed. Can you recollect names of organisms thathave more than one nucleus per cell? Some mature cells even lacknucleus, e.g., erythrocytes of many mammals and sieve tube cells ofcvascular plants. Would you consider these cells as ‘living’?The nuclear matrix or the nucleoplasm contains nucleolus andchromatin. The nucleoli are spherical structures present in thecnucleoplasm. The content of nucleolus is continuous with the rest of thenucleoplasm as it is not a membrane bound structure. It is a site forcactive ribosomal RNA synthesis. Larger and more numerous nucleoli arepresent in cells actively carrying out protein synthesis.NucleoplasmNucleolusNuclear poreNuclearmembraneFigure 8.11  Structure of nucleus2024-25CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE101KinetochorePGVxolcsarAChromosome withkinetochoreFigure 8.13  Types of chromosomes based on the position of centromereYou may recall that the interphase nucleus has a looseand indistinct network of nucleoprotein fibres calledchromatin. But during different stages of cell division, cellscshow structured chromosomes in place of the nucleus.Chromatin contains DNA and some basic proteins calledHhistones, some non-histone proteins and also RNA. Asingle human cell has approximately two metre longthread of DNA distributed among its forty six (twenty threepairs) chromosomes. You will study the details of DNApackaging in the form of a chromosome in class XII.Every chromosome (visible only in dividing cells)essentially has a primary constriction or the centromereon the sides of which disc shaped structures calledkinetochores are present (Figure 8.12). Centromere holdstwo chromatids of a chromosome. Based on the positionof the centromere, the chromosomes can be classified intofour types (Figure 8.13). The metacentric chromosomehas middle centromere forming two equal arms of thechromosome. The sub-metacentric chromosome hascentromere slightly away from the middle of thecchromosome resulting into one shorter arm and oneclonger arm. In case of acrocentric chromosome thecentromere is situated close to its end forming onecextremely short and one very long arm, whereas theHtelocentric chromosome has a terminal centromere.2024-25102BIOLOGYSometimes a few chromosomes have non-staining secondaryconstrictions at a constant location. This gives the appearance of a smallfragment called the satellite.8.5.11MicrobodiesMany membrane bound minute vesicles called microbodies that containvarious enzymes, are present in both plant and animal cells.SUMMARYAll organisms are made of cells or aggregates of cells. Cells vary in their shape, sizeand activities/functions. Based on the presence or absence of a membrane boundcnucleus and other organelles, cells and hence organisms can be named asceukaryotic or prokaryotic.A typical eukaryotic cell consists of a cell membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm.Plant cells have a cell wall outside the cell membrane. The plasma membrane iscselectively permeable and facilitates transport of several molecules. Thecendomembrane system includes ER, golgi complex, lysosomes and vacuoles. Allthe cell organelles perform different but specific functions. Centrosome and centrioleform the basal body of cilia and flagella that facilitate locomotion. In animal cells,ccentrioles also form spindle apparatus during cell division. Nucleus containscnucleoli and chromatin network. It not only controls the activities of organellesbut also plays a major role in heredity.Endoplasmic reticulum contains tubules or cisternae. They are of two types:rough and smooth. ER helps in the transport of substances, synthesis ofproteins, lipoproteins and glycogen. The golgi body is a membranous organellecomposed of flattened sacs. The secretions of cells are packed in them andctransported from the cell. Lysosomes are single membrane structurescontaining enzymes for digestion of all types of macromolecules. Ribosomescare involved in protein synthesis. These occur freely in the cytoplasm or areassociated with ER. Mitochondria help in oxidative phosphorylation andgeneration of adenosine triphosphate. They are bound by double membrane;cthe outer membrane is smooth and inner one folds into several cristae. Plastidscare pigment containing organelles found in plant cells only. In plant cells,chloroplasts are responsible for trapping light energy essential forcphotosynthesis. The grana, in the plastid, is the site of light reactions and thecstroma of dark reactions. The green coloured plastids are chloroplasts, whichccontain chlorophyll, whereas the other coloured plastids are chromoplasts,which may contain pigments like carotene and xanthophyll. The nucleus isenclosed by nuclear envelope, a double membrane structure with nuclear pores.The inner membrane encloses the nucleoplasm and the chromatin material.cThus, cell is the structural and functional unit of life.2024-25CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE103EXERCISES1.Which of the following is not correct?(a)Robert Brown discovered the cell.(b)Schleiden and Schwann formulated the cell theory.(c)Virchow explained that cells are formed from pre-existing cells.(d)A unicellular organism carries out its life activities within a single cell.2.New cells generate fromc(a)bacterial fermentation(b)regeneration of old cells(c)pre-existing cells(d)abiotic materials3.Match the followingColumn IColumn II(a)Cristae(i)Flat membranous sacs in stroma(b)Cisternae(ii)Infoldings in mitochondria(c)Thylakoids(iii)Disc-shaped sacs in Golgi apparatus4.Which of the following is correct:c(a)Cells of all living organisms have a nucleus.(b)Both animal and plant cells have a well defined cell wall.(c)In prokaryotes, there are no membrane bound organelles.(d)Cells are formed de novo from abiotic materials.5.What is a mesosome in a prokaryotic cell?

Now a question that arises in our minds is: Are all living organisms made of the same chemicals, i.e., elements and compounds? You have learnt in chemistry how elemental analysis is performed. If we perform such an analysis on a plant tissue, animal tissue or a microbial paste, we obtain a list of elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and several others and their respective content per unit mass of a living tissue. If the same analysis is performed on a piece of earth's crust as an example of non-living matter, we obtain a similar list. What are the differences between the two lists? In absolute terms, no such differences could be made out. All the elements present in a sample of earth's crust are also present in a sample of living tissue. However, a closer examination reveals that the relative abundance of carbon and hydrogen with respect to other elements is higher in any living organism than in earth's crust (Table 9.1). 9.1 HO W TO ANALYSE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION? We can continue asking in the same way, what type of organic compounds are found in living organisms? How does one go about finding the answer? To get an answer, one has to perform a chemical analysis. We can take any living tissue (a vegetable or a piece of liver, etc.) and grind it in trichloroacetic acid (Cl3CCOOH) using a mortar and a pestle. We obtain a thick slurry. If we were to strain this through a cheesecloth or cotton we would obtain two fractions. One is called the filtrate or more technically, the acid-soluble pool, and the second, the retentate or the acid-insoluble fraction. Scientists have found thousands of organic compounds in the acid-soluble pool. 2024-25 BIOMOLECULES 105 In higher classes you will learn about how TABLE 9.1 A Comparison of Elements Present in Non-living and Living Matter* to analyse a living tissue sample and identify a particular organic compound.

However, living organisms have also got inorganic elements and compounds in them. How do we know this? A slightly different but destructive experiment has to be done. One weighs a small amount of a living tissue (say a leaf or liver and this is called wet weight) and dry it. All the water, evaporates. The remaining material gives dry TABLE 9.2 A List of Representative Inorganic weight. Now if the tissue is fully burnt, all the Constituents of Living Tissues carbon compounds are oxidised to gaseous Component Formula form (CO2, water vapour) and are removed. What Sodium Na+ is remaining is called 'ash'. This ash contains Potassium K+ inorganic elements (like calcium, magnesium Calcium Ca++ etc). Inorganic compounds like sulphate, Magnesium Mg++ phosphate, etc., are also seen in the acid-soluble Water H2O fraction. Therefore elemental analysis gives Compounds NaCl, CaCO3, elemental composition of living tissues in the form of hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, carbon etc. PO34 − , SO24 − while analysis for compounds gives an idea of the kind of organic (Figure 9.1) and inorganic constituents (Table 9.2) present in living tissues. From a chemistry point of view, one can identify functional groups like aldehydes, ketones, aromatic compounds, etc. But from a biological point of view, we shall classify them into amino acids, nucleotide bases, fatty acids etc. Amino acids are organic compounds containing an amino group and an acidic group as substituents on the same carbon i.e., the α-carbon. Hence, they are called α-amino acids. They are substituted methanes. There are four substituent groups occupying the four valency positions. These are hydrogen, carboxyl group, amino group and a variable group designated as R group. Based on the nature of R group there are many amino acids. However, those which occur in proteins are only of twenty 2024-25 106 BIOLOGY types. The R group in these proteinaceous amino acids could be a hydrogen (the amino acid is called glycine), a methyl group (alanine), hydroxy methyl (serine), etc. Three of the twenty are shown in Figure 9.1. The chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially of the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. Based on number of amino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic (lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. Similarly, there are aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan). A particular property of amino acids is the ionizable nature of –NH2 and –COOH groups. Hence in solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes. B is called zwitterionic form. Lipids are generally water insoluble. They could be simple fatty acids. A fatty acid has a carboxyl group attached to an R group. The R group could be a methyl (–CH3), or ethyl (–C2H5) or higher number of –CH2 groups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). For example, palmitic acid has 16 carbons including carboxyl carbon. Arachidonic acid has 20 carbon atoms including the carboxyl carbon. Fatty acids could be saturated (without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double bonds). Another simple lipid is glycerol which is trihydroxy propane. Many lipids have both glycerol and fatty acids. Here the fatty acids are found esterified with glycerol. They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides. These are also called fats and oils based on melting point. Oils have lower melting point (e.g., gingelly oil) and hence remain as oil in winters. Can you identify a fat from the market? Some lipids have phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them. These are phospholipids. They are found in cell membrane. Lecithin is one example. Some tissues especially the neural tissues have lipids with more complex structures. Living organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which heterocyclic rings can be found. Some of these are nitrogen bases – adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. When found attached to a sugar, they are called nucleosides. If a phosphate group is also found esterified to the sugar they are called nucleotides. Adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and cytidine are nucleosides. Adenylic acid, thymidylic acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. Nucleic acids like DNA and RNA consist of nucleotides only. DNA and RNA function as genetic material. 2024-25 BIOMOLECULES 107 CH2OH O HOCH2 O OH HO OH OH OH OH C6H12O6 (Glucose) OH Glycine C5H10O5 (Ribose) Alanine Serine Amino acids Sugars (Carbohydrates) CH3 (CH2)14 COOH Fatty acid (Palmitic acid) Glycerol Triglyceride (R1, R2 and R3 are fatty acids) Cholesterol Phospholipid (Lecithin) Fats and oils (lipids) O HOCH2 Adenine O Adenine (Purine) OH OH HO P OCH2 OH O Adenine Adenosine O HOCH2 O Uracil HN OH OH O Adenylic acid N H Uracil (Pyrimidine) OH OH Uridine Nitrogen bases Nucleosides Figure 9.1 Nucleotide Diagrammatic representation of small molecular weight organic compounds in living tissues 2024-25 108 BIOLOGY 9.2 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY METABOLITES The most exciting aspect of chemistry deals with isolating thousands of compounds, small and big, from living organisms, determining their structure and if possible synthesising them. If one were to make a list of biomolecules, such a list would have thousands of organic compounds including amino acids, sugars, etc. For reasons that are given in section 9.10, we can call these biomolecules as 'metabolites'. In animal tissues, one notices the presence of all such categories of compounds shown in Figure 9.1. These are called primary metabolites. However, when one analyses plant, fungal and microbial cells, one would see thousands of compounds other than these called primary metabolites, e.g. alkaloids, flavonoids, rubber, essential oils, antibiotics, coloured pigments, scents, gums, spices. These are called secondary metabolites (Table 9.3). While primary metabolites have identifiable TABLE 9.3 Some Secondary Metabolites functions and play known roles in normal Pigments Carotenoids, Anthocyanins, physiologial processes, we do not at the moment, etc. understand the role or functions of all the Alkaloids Morphine, Codeine, etc. 'secondary metabolites' in host organisms.

Some secondary metabolites have Lectins Concanavalin A ecological importance. In the later chapters and Drugs Vinblastin, curcumin, etc. years you will learn more about this. Polymeric Rubber, gums, cellulose substances 9.3 B IOMACROMOLECULES There is one feature common to all those compounds found in the acid soluble pool. They have molecular weights ranging from 18 to around 800 daltons (Da) approximately. The acid insoluble fraction, has only four types of organic compounds i.e., proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides and lipids. These classes of compounds with the exception of lipids, have molecular weights in the range of ten thousand daltons and above. For this very reason, biomolecules, i.e., chemical compounds found in living organisms are of two types. One, those which have molecular weights less than one thousand dalton and are usually referred to as micromolecules or simply biomolecules while those which are found in the acid insoluble fraction are called macromolecules or biomacromolecules. The molecules in the insoluble fraction with the exception of lipids are polymeric substances. Then why do lipids, whose molecular weights do not exceed 800 Da, come under acid insoluble fraction, i.e., macromolecular fraction? Lipids are indeed small molecular weight 2024-25 BIOMOLECULES 109 compounds and are present not only as such but also arranged into structures like cell membrane and other membranes. When we grind a tissue, we are disrupting the cell structure. Cell membrane and other membranes are broken into pieces, and form vesicles which are not water soluble. Therefore, these membrane fragments in the form of vesicles get separated along with the acid insoluble pool and hence in the macromolecular fraction. Lipids are not strictly macromolecules. The acid soluble pool represents roughly the cytoplasmic composition. The macromolecules from TABLE 9.4 Average Composition of Cells cytoplasm and organelles become the acid insoluble fraction. Together they represent the entire chemical Component % of the total composition of living tissues or organisms. cellular mass In summary if we represent the chemical Water 70-90 composition of living tissue from abundance point of Proteins 10-15 view and arrange them class-wise, we observe that Carbohydrates 3 water is the most abundant chemical in living Lipids 2 organisms (Table 9.4). Nucleic acids 5-7 Ions 1 9.4 PROTEINS Proteins are polypeptides. They are linear chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds as shown in Figure 9.3. Each protein is a polymer of amino acids. As there are 20 types of amino acids (e.g., alanine, cysteine, proline, tryptophan, lysine, etc.), a protein is a heteropolymer and not a homopolymer. A homopolymer has only one type of monomer repeating 'n' number of times. This information about the amino acid content is important as later in your nutrition lessons, you will learn that certain amino acids are essential for our health and they have to be supplied through our diet. Hence, dietary proteins are the source of essential amino acids. Therefore, amino acids can be essential or non-essential. The latter are those which our body can make, while we get essential amino acids through our diet/food. Proteins carry out many functions in living organisms, some transport nutrients across cell membrane, some fight infectious organisms, some are hormones, some are enzymes, TABLE 9.5 Some Proteins and their Functions Protein Functions Collagen Intercellular ground substance Trypsin Enzyme Insulin Hormone Antibody Fights infectious agents Receptor Sensory reception (smell, taste, hormone, etc.) GLUT-4 Enables glucose transport into cells 2024-25 110 BIOLOGY etc. (Table 9.5). Collagen is the most abundant protein in animal world and Ribulose bisphosphate Carboxylase-Oxygenase (RuBisCO) is the most abundant protein in the whole of the biosphere. 9.5 POLYSACCHARIDES The acid insoluble pellet also has polysaccharides (carbohydrates) as another class of macromolecules. Polysaccharides are long chains of sugars. They are threads (literally a cotton thread) containing different monosaccharides as building blocks. For example, cellulose is a polymeric polysaccharide consisting of only one type of monosaccharide i.e., glucose. Cellulose is a homopolymer. Starch is a variant of this but present as a store house of energy in plant tissues. Animals have another variant called glycogen. Inulin is a polymer of fructose. In a polysaccharide chain (say glycogen), the right end is called the reducing end and the left end is called the non-reducing end. It has branches as shown in the form of a cartoon (Figure 9.2). Starch forms helical secondary structures. In fact, starch can hold I2 molecules in the helical portion. The starch-I2 is blue in colour. Cellulose does not contain complex helices and hence cannot hold I2. CH2OH CH2OH O O O O OH OH O O O O OH CH2 O O O O O Figure 9.2 Diagrammatic representation of a portion of glycogen 2024-25 OH OH BIOMOLECULES 111 Plant cell walls are made of cellulose. Paper made from plant pulp and cotton fibre is cellulosic. There are more complex polysaccharides in nature. They have as building blocks, amino-sugars and chemically modified sugars (e.g., glucosamine, N-acetyl galactosamine, etc.). Exoskeletons of arthropods, for example, have a complex polysaccharide called chitin. These complex polysaccharides are mostly homopolymers. 9.6 N UCLEIC ACIDS The other type of macromolecule that one would find in the acid insoluble fraction of any living tissue is the nucleic acid. These are polynucleotides. Together with polysaccharides and polypeptides these comprise the true macromolecular fraction of any living tissue or cell. For nucleic acids, the building block is a nucleotide. A nucleotide has three chemically distinct components. One is a heterocyclic compound, the second is a monosaccharide and the third a phosphoric acid or phosphate. As you notice in Figure 9.1, the heterocyclic compounds in nucleic acids are the nitrogenous bases named adenine, guanine, uracil, cytosine, and thymine. Adenine and Guanine are substituted purines while the rest are substituted pyrimidines. The skeletal heterocyclic ring is called as purine and pyrimidine respectively. The sugar found in polynucleotides is either ribose (a monosaccharide pentose) or 2' deoxyribose. A nucleic acid containing deoxyribose is called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) while that which contains ribose is called ribonucleic acid (RNA). 9.7 S TRUCTURE OF PROTEINS Proteins, as mentioned earlier, are heteropolymers containing strings of amino acids. Structure of molecules means different things in different contexts. In inorganic chemistry, the structure invariably refers to the molecular formulae (e.g., NaCl, MgCl2, etc.). Organic chemists always write a two dimensional view of the molecules while representing the structure of the molecules (e.g., benzene, naphthalene, etc.). Physicists conjure up the three dimensional views of molecular structures while biologists describe the protein structure at four levels. The sequence of amino acids i.e., the positional information in a protein – which is the first amino acid, which is second, and so on – is called the primary structure (Figure 9.3 a) of a protein. A protein is imagined as a line, the left end represented by the first amino acid and the right end represented by the last amino 2024-25 112 BIOLOGY (a) Primary Polypeptide (b) Secondary Alpha – Helix (c) (d) Beta– plated sheet Hydrogen Disulphide bond Tertiary Quaternary Figure 9.3 Various levels of Protein Structure acid. The first amino acid is also called as N-terminal amino acid. The last amino acid is called the C- terminal amino acid. A protein thread does not exist throughout as an extended rigid rod. The thread is folded in the form of a helix (similar to a revolving staircase). Of course, only some portions of the protein thread are arranged in the form of a helix. In proteins, only right handed helices are observed. Other regions of the protein thread are folded into other forms in what is called the secondary structure (Fig. 9.3 b). In addition, the long protein chain is also folded upon itself like a hollow woolen ball, giving rise to the tertiary structure (Fig. 9.3 c). This gives us a 3-dimensional view of a protein. Tertiary structure is absolutely necessary for the many biological activities of proteins. Some proteins are an assembly of more than one polypeptide or subunits. The manner in which these individual folded polypeptides or subunits are arranged with respect to each other (e.g. linear string of spheres, spheres arranged one upon each other in the form of a cube or plate etc.) is the architecture of a protein otherwise called the quaternary structure of a protein (Fig. 9.3 d). Adult human haemoglobin consists of 4 subunits. Two of these are identical to each other. Hence, two subunits of α type and two subunits of β type together constitute the human haemoglobin (Hb). 9.8 ENZYMES Almost all enzymes are proteins. There are some nucleic acids that behave like enzymes. These are called ribozymes. One can depict an enzyme by a line diagram. An enzyme like any protein has a primary structure, i.e., amino acid sequence of the protein. An enzyme like any protein has the secondary and the tertiary structure. When you look at a tertiary structure (Figure 9.3 d) you will notice that the backbone of the protein chain folds 2024-25 BIOMOLECULES 113 upon itself, the chain criss-crosses itself and hence, many crevices or pockets are made. One such pocket is the 'active site'. An active site of an enzyme is a crevice or pocket into which the substrate fits. Thus enzymes, through their active site, catalyse reactions at a high rate. Enzyme catalysts differ from inorganic catalysts in many ways, but one major difference needs mention. Inorganic catalysts work efficiently at high temperatures and high pressures, while enzymes get damaged at high temperatures (say above 40°C). However, enzymes isolated from organisms who normally live under extremely high temperatures (e.g., hot vents and sulphur springs), are stable and retain their catalytic power even at high temperatures (upto 80°-90°C). Thermal stability is thus an important quality of such enzymes isolated from thermophilic organisms. 9.8.1 Chemical Reactions How do we understand these enzymes? Let us first understand a chemical reaction. Chemical compounds undergo two types of changes. A physical change simply refers to a change in shape without breaking of bonds. This is a physical process. Another physical process is a change in state of matter: when ice melts into water, or when water becomes a vapour. These are also physical processes. However, when bonds are broken and new bonds are formed during transformation, this will be called a chemical reaction. For example: Ba(OH)2 + H2SO4 → BaSO4 + 2H2O is an inorganic chemical reaction. Similarly, hydrolysis of starch into glucose is an organic chemical reaction. Rate of a physical or chemical process refers to the amount of product formed per unit time. It can be expressed as: rate = δP δt Rate can also be called velocity if the direction is specified. Rates of physical and chemical processes are influenced by temperature among other factors. A general rule of thumb is that rate doubles or decreases by half for every 10°C change in either direction. Catalysed reactions proceed at rates vastly higher than that of uncatalysed ones. When enzyme catalysed reactions are observed, the rate would be vastly higher than the same but uncatalysed reaction. For example CO2 Carbonic anhydrase H2O → H CO3 ←  2 carbon dioxide water carbonic acid 2024-25 114 BIOLOGY In the absence of any enzyme this reaction is very slow, with about 200 molecules of H2CO3 being formed in an hour. However, by using the enzyme present within the cytoplasm called carbonic anhydrase, the reaction speeds dramatically with about 600,000 molecules being formed every second. The enzyme has accelerated the reaction rate by about 10 million times. The power of enzymes is incredible indeed! There are thousands of types of enzymes each catalysing a unique chemical or metabolic reaction. A multistep chemical reaction, when each of the steps is catalysed by the same enzyme complex or different enzymes, is called a metabolic pathway. For example, Glucose → 2 Pyruvic acid C6H12O6 + O2 → 2C3H4 O3 + 2H2O is actually a metabolic pathway in which glucose becomes pyruvic acid through ten different enzyme catalysed metabolic reactions. When you study respiration in Chapter 12 you will study these reactions. At this stage you should know that this very metabolic pathway with one or two additional reactions gives rise to a variety of metabolic end products. In our skeletal muscle, under anaerobic conditions, lactic acid is formed. Under normal aerobic conditions, pyruvic acid is formed. In yeast, during fermentation, the same pathway leads to the production of ethanol (alcohol). Hence, in different conditions different products are possible. 9.8.2 How do Enzymes bring about such High Rates of Chemical Conversions? To understand this we should study enzymes a little more. We have already understood the idea of an 'active site'. The chemical or metabolic conversion refers to a reaction. The chemical which is converted into a product is called a 'substrate'. Hence enzymes, i.e. proteins with three dimensional structures including an 'active site', convert a substrate (S) into a product (P). Symbolically, this can be depicted as: S →P It is now understood that the substrate 'S' has to bind the enzyme at its 'active site' within a given cleft or pocket. The substrate has to diffuse towards the 'active site'. There is thus, an obligatory formation of an 'ES' complex. E stands for enzyme. This complex formation is a transient phenomenon. During the state where substrate is bound to the enzyme active site, a new structure of the substrate called transition state structure is formed. Very soon, after the expected bond breaking/making is completed, the product is released from the active site. In other words, the structure of substrate gets transformed into the structure of product(s). The pathway of this transformation must go through the so-called 2024-25 BIOMOLECULES 115 Potential Energy Transition state transition state structure. There could be many Activation energy more 'altered structural states' between the stable without enzyme substrate and the product. Implicit in this statement is the fact that all other intermediate structural states are unstable. Stability is Activation something related to energy status of the energy with enzyme molecule or the structure. Hence, when we look Substrate (s) at this pictorially through a graph it looks like something as in Figure 9.4. The y-axis represents the potential energy content. The x-axis represents the progression of the structural transformation or states Product (P) through the 'transition state'. You would notice Progress of reaction two things. The energy level difference between Figure 9.4 Concept of activation energy S and P. If 'P' is at a lower level than 'S', the reaction is an exothermic reaction. One need not supply energy (by heating) in order to form the product. However, whether it is an exothermic or spontaneous reaction or an endothermic or energy requiring reaction, the 'S' has to go through a much higher energy state or transition state. The difference in average energy content of 'S' from that of this transition state is called 'activation energy'. Enzymes eventually bring down this energy barrier making the transition of 'S' to 'P' more easy. 9.8.3 Nature of Enzyme Action Each enzyme (E) has a substrate (S) binding site in its molecule so that a highly reactive enzyme-substrate complex (ES) is produced. This complex is short-lived and dissociates into its product(s) P and the unchanged enzyme with an intermediate formation of the enzyme-product complex (EP). The formation of the ES complex is essential for catalysis. E+S ES → EP → E + P The catalytic cycle of an enzyme action can be described in the following steps: 1. First, the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, fitting into the active site. 2. The binding of the substrate induces the enzyme to alter its shape, fitting more tightly around the substrate. 3. The active site of the enzyme, now in close proximity of the substrate breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate and the new enzyme- product complex is formed. 2024-25 116 BIOLOGY 4. The enzyme releases the products of the reaction and the free enzyme is ready to bind to another molecule of the substrate and run through the catalytic cycle once again. 9.8.4 Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity The activity of an enzyme can be affected by a change in the conditions which can alter the tertiary structure of the protein. These include temperature, pH, change in substrate concentration or binding of specific chemicals that regulate its activity. Temperature and pH Enzymes generally function in a narrow range of temperature and pH (Figure 9.5). Each enzyme shows its highest activity at a particular temperature and pH called the optimum temperature and optimum pH. Activity declines both below and above the optimum value. Low temperature preserves the enzyme in a temporarily inactive state whereas high temperature destroys enzymatic activity because proteins are denatured by heat. Concentration of Substrate With the increase in substrate concentration, the velocity of the enzymatic reaction rises at first. The reaction ultimately reaches a maximum velocity (Vmax) which is not exceeded by any further rise in concentration of the substrate. This is because the enzyme molecules are fewer than the substrate molecules and after saturation of these molecules, there are no free enzyme molecules to bind with the additional substrate molecules (Figure 9.5). The activity of an enzyme is also sensitive to the presence of specific chemicals that bind to the enzyme. When the binding of the chemical Enzyme activity Vmax 2 pH Temperature Velocity of reaction (V) Vmax (b) (a) (c) Km [S] Figure 9.5 Effect of change in : (a) pH (b) Temperature and (c) Concentration of substrate on enzyme activity 2024-25 BIOMOLECULES 117 shuts off enzyme activity, the process is called inhibition and the chemical is called an inhibitor. When the inhibitor closely resembles the substrate in its molecular structure and inhibits the activity of the enzyme, it is known as competitive inhibitor. Due to its close structural similarity with the substrate, the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the substrate-binding site of the enzyme. Consequently, the substrate cannot bind and as a result, the enzyme action declines, e.g., inhibition of succinic dehydrogenase by malonate which closely resembles the substrate succinate in structure. Such competitive inhibitors are often used in the control of bacterial pathogens. 9.8.5 Classification and Nomenclature of Enzymes Thousands of enzymes have been discovered, isolated and studied. Most of these enzymes have been classified into different groups based on the type of reactions they catalyse. Enzymes are divided into 6 classes each with 4-13 subclasses and named accordingly by a four-digit number. Oxidoreductases/dehydrogenases: Enzymes which catalyse oxidoreduction between two substrates S and S' e.g., S reduced + S' oxidised → S oxidised + S' reduced. Transferases: Enzymes catalysing a transfer of a group, G (other than hydrogen) between a pair of substrate S and S' e.g., S - G + S' → S + S' - G Hydrolases: Enzymes catalysing hydrolysis of ester, ether, peptide, glycosidic, C-C, C-halide or P-N bonds. Lyases: Enzymes that catalyse removal of groups from substrates by mechanisms other than hydrolysis leaving double bonds. Isomerases: Includes all enzymes catalysing inter-conversion of optical, geometric or positional isomers. Ligases: Enzymes catalysing the linking together of 2 compounds, e.g., enzymes which catalyse joining of C-O, C-S, C-N, P-O etc. bonds. 9.8.6 Co-factors Enzymes are composed of one or several polypeptide chains. However, there are a number of cases in which non-protein constituents called co-factors are bound to the the enzyme to make the enzyme catalytically 2024-25 118 BIOLOGY active. In these instances, the protein portion of the enzymes is called the apoenzyme. Three kinds of cofactors may be identified: prosthetic groups, co-enzymes and metal ions. Prosthetic groups are organic compounds and are distinguished from other cofactors in that they are tightly bound to the apoenzyme. For example, in peroxidase and catalase, which catalyze the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, haem is the prosthetic group and it is a part of the active site of the enzyme. Co-enzymes are also organic compounds but their association with the apoenzyme is only transient, usually occurring during the course of catalysis. Furthermore, co-enzymes serve as co-factors in a number of different enzyme catalyzed reactions. The essential chemical components of many coenzymes are vitamins, e.g., coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and NADP contain the vitamin niacin. A number of enzymes require metal ions for their activity which form coordination bonds with side chains at the active site and at the same time form one or more cordination bonds with the substrate, e.g., zinc is a cofactor for the proteolytic enzyme carboxypeptidase. Catalytic activity is lost when the co-factor is removed from the enzyme which testifies that they play a crucial role in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. S UMMARY Although there is a bewildering diversity of living organisms, their chemical composition and metabolic reactions appear to be remarkably similar. The elemental composition of living tissues and non-living matter appear also to be similar when analysed qualitatively. However, a closer examination reveals that the relative abundance of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen is higher in living systems when compared to inanimate matter. The most abundant chemical in living organisms is water. There are thousands of small molecular weight (\u003c1000 Da) biomolecules. Amino acids, monosaccharide and disaccharide sugars, fatty acids, glycerol, nucleotides, nucleosides and nitrogen bases are some of the organic compounds seen in living organisms. There are 20 types of amino acids and 5 types of nucleotides. Fats and oils are glycerides in which fatty acids are esterified to glycerol. Phospholipids contain, in addition, a phosphorylated nitrogenous compound. Only three types of macromolecules, i.e., proteins, nucleic acids and polysaccharides are found in living systems. Lipids, because of their association with membranes separate in the macromolecular fraction. Biomacromolecules are polymers. They are made of building blocks which are different. Proteins are heteropolymers made of amino acids. Nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) are composed of nucleotides. Biomacromolecules have a hierarchy of structures – 2024-25 BIOMOLECULES 119 primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. Nucleic acids serve as genetic material. Polysaccharides are components of cell wall in plants, fungi and also of the , fungi and also\r\nof the exoskeleton of arthropods. They also are storage forms of energy (e.g.,\r\nstarch and glycogen). Proteins serve a variety of cellular functions. Many of\r\nthem are enzymes, some are antibodies, some are receptors, some are hormones\r\nand some others are structural proteins.

    "input": "120BIOLOGYAre you aware that all organisms, even the largest, start their life from asingle cell? You may wonder how a single cell then goes on to form suchlarge organisms. Growth and reproduction are characteristics of cells,sindeed of all living organisms. All cells reproduce by dividing into two,swith each parental cell giving rise to two daughter cells each time theydivide. These newly formed daughter cells can themselves grow and divide,giving rise to a new cell population that is formed by the growth andsdivision of a single parental cell and its progeny. In other words, suchcycles of growth and division allow a single cell to form a structureconsisting of millions of cells.10.1CELL CYCLECell division is a very important  process in all living organisms. Duringthe division of a cell, DNA replication and cell growth also take place. Allthese processes, i.e., cell division, DNA replication, and cell growth, hence,shave to take place in a coordinated way to ensure correct division andformation of progeny cells containing intact genomes. The sequence ofevents by which a cell duplicates its genome, synthesises the othersconstituents of the cell and eventually divides into two daughter cells istermed cell cycle. Although cell growth (in terms of cytoplasmic increase)is a continuous process, DNA synthesis occurs only during one specificstage in the cell cycle. The replicated chromosomes (DNA) are thendistributed to daughter nuclei by a complex series of events during celldivision. These events are themselves under genetic control.CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISIONCHAPTER  1010.1Cell Cycle10.2M Phase10.3Significance ofMitosis10.4Meiosis10.5Significance ofMeiosis2024-25CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION12110.1.1Phases of Cell CycleA typical eukaryotic cell cycle is illustrated byhuman cells in culture. These cells divide oncein approximately every 24 hours (Figure 10.1).However, this duration of cell cycle can vary fromorganism to organism and also from cell typesto cell type. Yeast for example, can progressthrough the cell cycle in only about 90 minutes.The cell cycle is divided into two basicphases:Interphase�M Phase (Mitosis phase)The M Phase represents the phase when theactual cell division or mitosis occurs and theinterphase represents the phase between twossuccessive M phases. It is significant to note thatsin the 24 hour average duration of cell cycle of ahuman cell, cell division proper lasts for onlyabout an hour. The interphase lasts more than95% of the duration of cell cycle.The M Phase starts with the nuclear division, corresponding to theseparation of daughter chromosomes (karyokinesis) and usually endswith division of cytoplasm (cytokinesis). The interphase, though  calledthe resting phase,  is the time during which the cell is preparing for divisionsby undergoing both cell growth and DNA replication in an orderly manner.The interphase is divided into three further phases:G1 phase (Gap 1)�S phase  (Synthesis)�G2 phase (Gap 2) G1 phase corresponds to the interval between mitosis and initiationof DNA replication. During G1 phase the cell is metabolically active andcontinuously grows but does not replicate its DNA. S or synthesis  phasemarks the period during which DNA synthesis or replication takes place.During this time the amount of DNA per cell doubles.  If the initial amountof DNA is denoted as 2C then it increases to 4C. However, there is noincrease in the chromosome number; if the cell had diploid or 2n numbersof chromosomes at G1, even after S phase the number of chromosomesremains the same, i.e., 2n.In animal cells, during the S phase, DNA replication begins in thenucleus, and the centriole duplicates in the cytoplasm. During the G2phase, proteins are synthesised in preparation for mitosis while cell growthcontinues.How do plants andanimals continue togrow all their lives?Do all cells in a plantdivide all the time?Do you think all cellscontinue to divide inall plants andanimals? Can youtell the name and thelocation of tissueshaving cells thatdivide all their life inhigher plants? Doanimals have similarmeristematictissues?Figure 10.1 A diagrammatic view of cell cycleindicating formation of two cellsfrom one cellM Phase2024-25122BIOLOGYSome cells in the adult animals do not appear to exhibit division (e.g.,heart cells) and many other cells divide only occasionally, as needed toreplace cells that have been lost because of injury or cell death. Thesecells that do not divide further exit G1 phase to enter an inactive stagecalled quiescent stage (Gquiescent stage (Gquiescent stage (Gquiescent stage (Gquiescent stage (G00000))o))) of the cell cycle. Cells in this stage remainmetabolically active but no longer proliferate unless called on to do sodepending on the requirement of the organism.In animals, mitotic cell division is only seen in the diploid somaticcells. However, there are few exceptions to this where haploid cells divideby mitosis, for example, male honey bees. Against this, the plants cansshow mitotic divisions in both haploid and diploid cells. From yourrecollection of examples of alternation of generations in plants (Chapter 3)identify plant species and stages at which mitosis is seen in haploid cells.10.210.210.210.210.2M PM PoM PM PM PHASEHASEoHASEHASEHASEThis is the most dramatic period of the cell cycle, involving a majorreorganisation of virtually all components of the cell. Since the number ofchromosomes in the parent and progeny cells is the same, it is also called asequational divisionequational divisionequational divisionequational divisionequational division. Though for convenience mitosis has been dividedinto four stages of nuclear division (karyokinesis), it is very essential tounderstand that cell division is a progressive process and very clear-cutlines cannot be drawn between various stages. Karyokinesis involvesfollowing four stages:ProphaseProphaseProphaseProphaseProphase�MetaphaseMetaphaseMetaphaseMetaphaseMetaphase�AnaphaseAnaphaseAnaphaseAnaphaseAnaphase�TelophaseTelophaseTelophaseTelophaseTelophase10.2.110.2.1o10.2.110.2.110.2.1ProphaseProphaseProphaseProphaseProphaseProphase which is the first stage of karyokinesis of mitosis follows theS and G2 phases of interphase. In the S and G2 phases the new DNAmolecules formed are not distinct but intertwined. Prophase is markedsby the initiation of condensation of chromosomal material. Thechromosomal material becomes untangled during the process ofchromatin condensation (Figure 10.2 a). The centrosome, which hadundergone duplication during S phase of interphase, now begins to movetowards opposite poles of the cell. The completion of prophase can thusbe marked by the following characteristic events:Chromosomal material condenses to form compact mitoticchromosomes. Chromosomes are seen to be composed of twochromatids attached together at the centromere.Centrosome which had undergone duplication during interphase,begins to move towards opposite poles of the cell. Each centrosomeradiates out microtubules called asters. The two asters togetherwith spindle fibres forms mitotic apparatus.You have studiedmitosis in onion roottip cells.  It has 16chromosomes ineach cell.  Can youtell how manychromosomes willthe cell have at G1phase, after S phase,sand after M phase?Also, what will be theDNA content of thecells at G1, after Sand at G2, if thecontent after Mphase is 2C?2024-25CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION123Cells at the end of prophase, when viewed under themicroscope, do not show golgi complexes, endoplasmicreticulum, nucleolus and the nuclear envelope.10.2.2MetaphaseThe complete disintegration of the nuclear envelope markssthe start of the second phase of mitosis, hence thechromosomes are spread through the cytoplasm of the cell.By this stage, condensation of chromosomes is completedsand they can be observed clearly under the microscope. Thisthen, is the stage at which morphology of chromosomes ismost easily studied. At this stage, metaphase chromosomeis made up of two sister chromatids, which are held togetherby the centromere (Figure 10.2 b). Small disc-shapedstructures at the surface of the centromeres are calledskinetochores. These structures serve as the sites of attachmentof spindle fibres (formed by the spindle fibres) to thechromosomes that are moved into position at the centre ofsthe cell. Hence, the metaphase is characterised by all thechromosomes coming to lie at the equator with one chromatidof each chromosome connected by its kinetochore to spindlesfibres from one pole and its sister chromatid connected byits kinetochore to spindle fibres from the opposite pole (Figure10.2 b). The plane of alignment of the chromosomes atsmetaphase is referred to as the metaphase plate.  The keyfeatures of metaphase are:Spindle fibres attach to kinetochores ofchromosomes.Chromosomes are moved to spindle equator and getaligned along metaphase plate through spindle fibresto both poles.10.2.3AnaphaseAt the onset of anaphase, each chromosome arranged at themetaphase plate is split simultaneously and the two daughterchromatids, now referred to as daughter  chromosomes ofthe future daughter nuclei, begin their migration towardssthe two opposite poles. As each chromosome moves awayfrom the equatorial plate, the centromere of each chromosomeremains directed towards the pole and hence at the leadingsedge, with the arms of the chromosome trailing behind(Figure 10.2 c). Thus, anaphase stage is characterised byFigure 10.2 a and b : A diagrammaticview of stages in mitosis2024-25124BIOLOGYthe following key events:Centromeres split and chromatids separate.�Chromatids move to opposite poles.10.2.4TelophaseAt the beginning of the final stage of karyokinesis, i.e.,telophase, the chromosomes that have reached theirsrespective poles decondense and lose their individuality. Theindividual chromosomes can no longer be seen and each setof chromatin material tends to collect at each of the two poless(Figure 10.2 d). This is the stage which shows the followingkey events:Chromosomes cluster at opposite spindle poles and theiridentity is lost as discrete elements.Nuclear envelope develops around the chromosomeclusters at each pole forming two daughter nuclei.Nucleolus, golgi complex and ER reform.10.2.5CytokinesisMitosis accomplishes not only the segregation of duplicatedchromosomes into daughter nuclei (karyokinesis), but thecell itself is divided into two daughter cells by the separationof cytoplasm called cytokinesis at the end of which celldivision gets completed (Figure 10.2 e). In an animal cell,this is achieved by the appearance of a furrow in the plasmamembrane. The furrow gradually deepens and ultimatelyjoins in the centre dividing the cell cytoplasm into two. Plantcells however, are enclosed by a relatively inextensible cellwall, thererfore they undergo cytokinesis by a differentsmechanism. In plant cells, wall formation starts in the centreof the cell and grows outward to meet the existing lateralwalls. The formation of the new cell wall begins with theformation of a simple precursor, called the cell-plate thatrepresents the middle lamella between the walls of twosadjacent cells. At the time of cytoplasmic division, organelleslike mitochondria and plastids get distributed between thetwo daughter cells. In some organisms karyokinesis is notfollowed by cytokinesis as a result of which multinucleatecondition arises leading to the formation of syncytium (e.g.,liquid endosperm in coconut).Figure 10.2 c to e : A diagrammaticview of stages in Mitosis2024-25CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION12510.3Significance of MitosisMitosis or the equational division is usually restricted to the diploid cellsonly. However, in some lower plants and in some social insects haploidscells also divide by mitosis. It is very essential to understand thessignificance of this division in the life of an organism. Are you aware ofssome examples where you have studied about haploid and diploid insects?Mitosis usually results in the production of diploid daughter cellswith identical genetic complement. The growth of multicellular organismssis due to mitosis. Cell growth results in disturbing the ratio between thesnucleus and the cytoplasm. It therefore becomes essential for the cell tosdivide to restore the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. A very significantscontribution of mitosis is cell repair. The cells of the upper layer of theepidermis, cells of the lining of the gut, and blood cells are being constantlyreplaced. Mitotic divisions in the meristematic tissues – the apical andthe lateral cambium, result in a continuous growth of plants throughoutstheir life.10.4MEIOSISThe production of offspring by sexual reproduction includes the fusionsof two gametes, each with a complete haploid set of chromosomes. Gametessare formed from specialised diploid cells. This specialised kind of celldivision that reduces the chromosome number by half results in theproduction of haploid daughter cells. This kind of division is calledPmeiosis. Meiosis ensures the production of haploid phase in the life cycleof sexually reproducing organisms whereas fertilisation restores the diploidsphase. We come across meiosis during gametogenesis in plants andanimals. This leads to the formation of haploid gametes. The key featuresof meiosis are as follows:Meiosis involves two sequential cycles of nuclear and cell division calledmeiosis I and meiosis II but only a single cycle of DNA replication.Meiosis I is initiated after the parental chromosomes have replicatedto produce identical sister chromatids at the S phase.Meiosis involves pairing of homologous chromosomes andrecombination between non-sister chromatids of homologousschromosomes.Four haploid cells are formed at the end of meiosis II.Meiotic events can be grouped under the following phases:Meiosis IMeiosis IIProphase IProphase IIMetaphase IMetaphase IIAnaphase IAnaphase IITelophase ITelophase II2024-25126BIOLOGY10.4.1Meiosis IProphase I: Prophase of the first meiotic division is typically longer andmore complex when compared to prophase of mitosis. It has been furthersubdivided into the following five phases based on chromosomalsbehaviour, i.e., Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene and Diakinesis.During leptotene stage the chromosomes become gradually visibleunder the light microscope. The compaction of chromosomes continuessthroughout leptotene. This is followed by the second stage of prophaseI called zygotene. During this stage chromosomes start pairing togetherand this process of association is called synapsis. Such pairedchromosomes are called homologous chromosomes. Electronmicrographs of this stage indicate that chromosome synapsis isaccompanied by the formation of complex structure calledPsynaptonemal complex. The complex formed by a pair of synapsedhomologous chromosomes is called a bivalent or a tetrad. However,these are more clearly visible at the next stage. The first two stages ofsprophase I are relatively short-lived compared to the next stage that ispachytene. During this stage, the four chromatids of each bivalentchromosomes becomes distinct and clearly appears as tetrads. This stageis characterised by the appearance of recombination nodules, the sitessat which crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids of thehomologous chromosomes. Crossing over is the exchange of geneticsmaterial between two homologous chromosomes. Crossing over is alsoan enzyme-mediated process and the enzyme involved is calledrecombinase. Crossing over leads to recombination of genetic materialson the two chromosomes. Recombination between homologouschromosomes is completed by the end of pachytene, leaving thechromosomes linked at the sites of crossing over.The beginning of diplotene is recognised by the dissolution of thesynaptonemal complex and the tendency of the recombinedshomologous chromosomes of the bivalents to separate from each othersexcept at the sites of crossovers. These X-shaped structures, are calledchiasmata. In oocytes of some vertebrates, diplotene can last formonths or years.The final stage of meiotic prophase I is diakinesis. This is marked byterminalisation of chiasmata. During this phase the chromosomes arefully condensed and the meiotic spindle is assembled to prepare theshomologous chromosomes for separation. By the end of diakinesis, thenucleolus disappears and the nuclear envelope also breaks down.Diakinesis represents transition to metaphase.PMetaphase I: The bivalent chromosomes align on the equatorial plate(Figure 10.3). The microtubules from the opposite poles of the spindlesattach to the kinetochore of homologous chromosomes.2024-25CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION127Anaphase I: The homologous chromosomes separate, while sisterchromatids remain associated at their centromeres (Figure 10.3).Telophase I: The nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear, cytokinesisfollows and this is called as dyad of cells (Figure 10.3). Although in manycases the chromosomes do undergo some dispersion, they do not reachthe extremely extended state of the interphase nucleus. The stage betweensthe two meiotic divisions is called interkinesis and is generally short lived.There is no replication of DNA during interkinesis. Interkinesis is followedby prophase II, a much simpler prophase than prophase I.10.4.2Meiosis IIProphase II: Meiosis II is initiated immediately after cytokinesis, usuallybefore the chromosomes have fully elongated.  In contrast to meiosis I,smeiosis II resembles a normal mitosis. The nuclear membrane disappearsby the end of prophase II (Figure 10.4). The chromosomes again becomecompact.Metaphase II: At this stage the chromosomes align at the equator andthe microtubules from opposite poles of the spindle get attached to thekinetochores (Figure 10.4) of sister chromatids.Anaphase II: It begins with the simultaneous splitting of the centromereof each chromosome  (which was holding the sister chromatids together),allowing them to move toward opposite poles of the cell (Figure 10.4) byshortening of microtubules attached to kinetochores.Figure 10.3 Stages of Meiosis I2024-25128BIOLOGYTelophase II: Meiosis ends with telophase II, in which the twogroups of chromosomes once again get enclosed by a nuclearenvelope; cytokinesis follows resulting in the formation of tetradof cells i.e., four haploid daughter cells (Figure 10.4).10.5SIGNIFICANCE OF MEIOSISMeiosis is the mechanism by which conservation of specificchromosome number of each species is achieved acrossgenerations in sexually reproducing organisms, even though theprocess, per se, paradoxically, results in reduction of chromosomesnumber by half. It also increases the genetic variability in thepopulation of organisms from one generation to the next. Variationsare very important for the process of evolution.Figure 10.4 Stages of Meiosis IISUMMARYAccording to the cell theory, cells arise from preexisting cells. The process byswhich this occurs is called cell division. Any sexually reproducing organismstarts its life cycle from a single-celled zygote. Cell division does not stop withsthe formation of the mature organism but continues throughout its life cycle.2024-25CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION129The stages through which a cell passes from one division to the next is calledthe cell cycle. Cell cycle is divided into two phases called (i) Interphase – aperiod of preparation for cell division, and (ii) Mitosis (M phase) – the actualperiod of cell division. Interphase is further subdivided into G1, S and G2. G1phase is the period when the cell grows and carries out normal metabolism.Most of the organelle duplication also occurs during this phase. S phase marksthe phase of DNA replication and chromosome duplication. G2 phase is theperiod of cytoplasmic growth. Mitosis is also divided into four stages namelysprophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Chromosome condensationsoccurs during prophase. Simultaneously, the centrioles move to the oppositepoles. The nuclear envelope and the nucleolus disappear and the spindlefibres start appearing. Metaphase is marked by the alignment of chromosomessat the equatorial plate. During anaphase the centromeres divide and thechromatids start moving towards the two opposite poles. Once the chromatidsreach the two poles, the chromosomal elongation starts, nucleolus and thesnuclear membrane reappear. This stage is called the telophase.  Nucleardivision is then followed by the cytoplasmic division and is called cytokinesis.sMitosis thus, is the equational division in which the chromosome number ofsthe parent is conserved in the daughter cell.In contrast to mitosis, meiosis occurs in the diploid cells, which are destined toform gametes. It is called the reduction division since it reduces the chromosomesnumber by half while making the gametes. In sexual reproduction when the twogametes fuse the chromosome number is restored to the value in the parent.Meiosis is divided into two phases – meiosis I and meiosis II. In the first meioticsdivision the homologous chromosomes pair to form bivalents, and undergo crossingover. Meiosis I has a long prophase, which is divided further into five phases.These are leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis. Duringmetaphase I the bivalents arrange on the equatorial plate. This is followed byanaphase I in which homologous chromosomes move to the opposite poles withboth their chromatids. Each pole receives half the chromosome number of thesparent cell. In telophase I, the nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear. MeiosisII is similar to mitosis. During anaphase II the sister chromatids separate. Thus atsthe end of meiosis four haploid cells are formed.EXERCISES1.What is the average cell cycle span for a mammalian cell?2.Distinguish cytokinesis from karyokinesis.3.Describe the events taking place during interphase.4.What is Go (quiescent phase) of cell cycle?2024-25130BIOLOGY5.Why is mitosis called equational division?6.Name the stage of cell cycle at which one of the following events occur:(i)Chromosomes are moved to spindle equator.(ii)Centromere splits and chromatids separate.(iii)Pairing between homologous chromosomes takes place.(iv)Crossing over between homologous chromosomes takes place.7.Describe the following:(a) synapsis  (b) bivalent  (c) chiasmataDraw a diagram to illustrate your answer.8.How does cytokinesis in plant cells differ from that in animal cells?9.Find examples where the four daughter cells from meiosis are equal in size andwhere they are found unequal in size.10.Distinguish anaphase of mitosis from anaphase I of meiosis.11.List the main differences between mitosis and meiosis.12.What is the significance of meiosis?13.Discuss with your teacher about(i)haploid insects and lower plants where cell-division occurs, and(ii)some haploid cells in higher plants where cell-division does not occur.14.Can there be mitosis without DNA replication in ‘S’ phase?15.Can there be DNA replication without cell division?16.Analyse the events during every stage of cell cycle and notice how the followingstwo parameters change(i)number of chromosomes (N) per cell(ii)amount of DNA content (C) per cell2024-25",

    "input": "UNIT 4 The description of structure and variation of living organisms over a period of time, ended up as two, apparently irreconcilable perspectives on biology. The two perspectives essentially rested on two levels of organisation of life forms and phenomena. One described at organismic and above level of organisation while the second described at cellular and molecular level of organisation. The first resulted in ecology and related disciplines. The second resulted in physiology and biochemistry. Description of physiological processes, in flowering plants as an example, is what is given in the chapters in this unit. The processes of photosynthesis, respiration and ultimately plant growth and development are described in molecular terms but in the context of cellular activities and even at organism level. Wherever appropriate, the relation of the physiological processes to environment is also discussed.PLANT PHYSIOLOGY Chapter 11 Photosynthesis in Higher Plants Chapter 12 Respiration in Plants Chapter 13 Plant Growth and Development 2024-25 MELVIN CALVIN born in Minnesota in April, 1911, received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Minnesota. He served as Professor of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Just after world war II, when the world was under shock after the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings, and seeing the ill- effects of radio-activity, Calvin and co-workers put radio- activity to beneficial use. He along with J.A. Bassham studied reactions in green plants forming sugar and other substances from raw materials like carbon dioxide, water and minerals by labelling the carbon dioxide with C14. Calvin proposed that plants change light energy to chemical energy by transferring an electron in an organised array of pigment molecules and other substances. The mapping of the pathway of carbon assimilation in photosynthesis earned him Nobel Prize in 1961. The principles of photosynthesis as established by Calvin are, at present, being used in studies on renewable resource for energy and materials and basic studies in solar energy research. Melvin Calvin 2024-25 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 133 All animals including human beings depend on plants for their food. Have you ever wondered from where plants get their food? Green plants, in fact, have to make or rather synthesise the food they need and all other organisms depend on them for their needs. The green plants make or rather synthesise the food they need through photosynthesis and are therefore called autotrophs. You have alr eady lear nt that the autotr ophic nutrition is found only in plants and all other organisms that depend on the green plants for food are heterotrophs. Green plants carry out ‘photosynthesis’, a physico-chemical process by which they use light energy to drive the synthesis of organic compounds. Ultimately, all living forms on earth depend on sunlight for energy. The use of energy from sunlight by plants doing photosynthesis is the basis of life on earth. Photosynthesis is important due to two reasons: it is the primary source of all food on earth. It is also responsible for the release of oxygen into the atmosphere by green plants. Have you ever thought what would happen if there were no oxygen to breath? This chapter focusses on the structure of the photosynthetic machinery and the various reactions that transform light energy into chemical energy. 11.1 WHAT DO WE KNOW? Let us try to find out what we already know about photosynthesis. Some simple experiments you may have done in the earlier classes have shown that chlorophyll (green pigment of the leaf), light and CO2 are required for photosynthesis to occur . You may have carried out the experiment to look for star ch for mation in two leaves – a variegated leaf or a leaf that was partially covered with black paper , and exposed to light. On testing these leaves for the pr esence of starch it was clear that photosynthesis occurred only in the green parts of the leaves in the presence of light.PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTSCHAPTER 11 11.1 What do we Know? 11.2 Early Experiments 11.3 Where does Photosynthesis take place? 11.4 How many Pigments are involved in Photosynthesis? 11.5 What is Light Reaction? 11.6 The Electron Transport 11.7 Where are the ATP and NADPH Used? 11.8 The C4 Pathway 11.9 hotorespiration 11.10 Factors affecting Photosynthesis 2024-25 134 BIOLOGY Another experiment you may have carried out where a part of a leaf is enclosed in a test tube containing some KOH soaked cotton (which absorbs CO2), while the other half is exposed to air . The setup is then placed in light for some time. On testing for the presence of starch later in the two parts of the leaf, you must have found that the exposed part of the leaf tested positive for starch while the portion that was in the tube, tested negative. This showed that CO2 was required for photosynthesis. Can you explain how this conclusion could be drawn? 11.2EARLY EXPERIMENTS It is interesting to learn about those simple experiments that led to a gradual development in our understanding of photosynthesis. Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) in 1770 performed a series of experiments that revealed the essential role of air in the growth of green plants. Priestley, you may recall, discovered oxygen in 1774. Priestley observed that a candle burning in a closed space – a bell jar , soon gets extinguished (Figure 11.1 a, b, c, d). Similarly, a mouse would soon suffocate in a closed space. He concluded that a bur ning candle or an animal that br eathe the air , both somehow, damage the air . But when he placed a mint plant in the same bell jar , he found that the mouse stayed alive and the candle continued to burn. Priestley hypothesised as follows: Plants restore to the air whatever breathing animals and burning candles remove. Can you imagine how Priestley would have conducted the experiment using a candle and a plant? Remember , he would need to r ekindle the candle to test whether it burns after a few days. How many different ways can you think of to light the candle without disturbing the set-up? Using a similar setup as the one used by Priestley, but by placing it once in the dark and once in the sunlight, Jan Ingenhousz (1730-1799) showed that sunlight is essential to the plant process that somehow purifies the air fouled by burning candles or breathing animals. Ingenhousz in an elegant experiment with an aquatic plant showed that in bright sunlight, small bubbles were formed around the green parts while in the dark they did not. Later he identified these bubbles to be of oxygen. Hence he showed that it is only the green part of the plants that could release oxygen. (a) (c)(b) (d) Figure 11.1 Priestley’s experiment 2024-25 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 135 It was not until about 1854 that Julius von Sachs provided evidence for production of glucose when plants grow. Glucose is usually stored as starch. His later studies showed that the green substance in plants (chlorophyll as we know it now) is located in special bodies (later called chloroplasts) within plant cells. He found that the green parts in plants is where glucose is made, and that the glucose is usually stored as starch. Now consider the interesting experiments done by T.W Engelmann (1843 – 1909). Using a prism he split light into its spectral components and then illuminated a green alga, Cladophora , placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria. The bacteria were used to detect the sites of O2 evolution. He observed that the bacteria accumulated mainly in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum. A first action spectrum of photosynthesis was thus described. It resembles roughly the absorption spectra of chlorophyll a and b (discussed in section 11.4). By the middle of the nineteenth century the key features of plant photosynthesis were known, namely, that plants could use light energy to make carbohydrates fr om CO2 and water . The empirical equation representing the total process of photosynthesis for oxygen evolving organisms was then understood as: CO H O CH O OLight 2 2 2 2 +  →   + [ ] where [CH2O] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon sugar). A milestone contribution to the understanding of photosynthesis was that made by a microbiologist, Cornelius van Niel (1897-1985), who, based on his studies of purple and green bacteria, demonstrated that photosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction in which hydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. This can be expressed by: 2 22 2 2 2 H ACO A CH O H OLight+  →   + + In green plants H2O is the hydrogen donor and is oxidised to O2. Some organisms do not release O2 during photosynthesis. When H2S, instead is the hydrogen donor for purple and green sulphur bacteria, the ‘oxidation’ product is sulphur or sulphate depending on the organism and not O2. Hence, he inferred that the O2 evolved by the green plant comes from H2O, not from carbon dioxide. This was later proved by using radioisotopic techniques. The correct equation, that would represent the overall process of photosynthesis is therefore: 6 12 6 62 2 6 12 6 2 2 CO H O C H O H O OLight+  →   + + where C6 H12 O6 represents glucose. The O2 released is from water; this was proved using radio isotope techniques. Note that this is not a single 2024-25 136 BIOLOGY reaction but description of a multistep process called photosynthesis. Can you explain why twelve molecules of water as substrate are used in the equation given above? 11.3 WHERE DOES PHOTOSYNTHESIS TAKE PLACE? You would of course answer: in ‘the gr een leaf’ or ‘in the chlor oplasts’ , based on what you earlier r ead in Chapter 8. Y ou ar e definitely right. Photosynthesis does take place in the green leaves of plants but it does so also in other green parts of the plants. Can you name some other parts where you think photosynthesis may occur? You would r ecollect fr om pr evious unit that the mesophyll cells in the leaves, have a large number of chloroplasts. Usually the chloroplasts align themselves along the walls of the mesophyll cells, such that they get the optimum quantity of the incident light. When do you think the chloroplasts will be aligned with their flat surfaces parallel to the walls? When would they be perpendicular to the incident light? You have studied the structure of chlor oplast in Chapter 8. W ithin the chloroplast there is membranous system consisting of grana, the stroma lamellae, and the matrix stroma (Figure 11.2). There is a clear division of labour within the chloroplast. The membrane system is responsible for trapping the light energy and also for the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. In stroma, enzymatic r eactions synthesise sugar , which in turn forms starch. The former set of reactions, since they are directly light driven are called light reactions (photochemical reactions). The latter are not directly light driven but are dependent on the products of light reactions (ATP and NADPH). Hence, to distinguish the latter they are called, by convention, as dark reactions (carbon r eactions). However , this should not be construed to mean that they occur in darkness or that they are not light-dependent.

Looking at plants have you ever wondered why and how there are so many shades of green in their leaves – even in the same plant? W e can look for an answer to this question by trying to separate the leaf pigments of any green plant through paper chromatography. A chromatographic separation of the leaf pigments shows that the colour that we see in leaves is not due to a single pigment but due to four pigments: Chlorophyll aaaaa (bright or blue green in the chromatogram), chlorophyll b bb bb (yellow green), xanthophylls (yellow) and carotenoids (yellow to yellow-orange). Let us now see what roles various pigments play in photosynthesis. Pigments are substances that have an ability to absorb light, at specific wavelengths. Can you guess which is the most abundant plant pigment in the world? Let us study the graph showing the ability of chlorophyll a pigment to absorb lights of different wavelengths (Figure 11.3 a). Of course, you are familiar with the wavelength of the visible spectrum of light as well as the VIBGYOR. From Figure 11.3a can you determine the wavelength (colour of light) at which chlorophyll a shows the maximum absorption? Does it show another absorption peak at any other wavelengths too? If yes, which one? Now look at Figure 11.3b showing the wavelengths at which maximum photosynthesis occurs in a plant. Can you see that the wavelengths at which there is maximum absorption by chlorophyll a, i.e., in the blue and the red regions, also shows higher rate of photosynthesis. Hence, we can conclude that chlorophyll a is the chief pigment associated with photosynthesis. But by looking at Figure 11.3c can you say that there is a complete one- to-one overlap between the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a and the action spectrum of photosynthesis?Figure 11.3a Graph showing the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a, b and the carotenoids Figure 11.3b Graph showing action spectrum of photosynthesis Figure 11.3c Graph showing action spectrum of photosynthesis superimposed on absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a 2024-25 138 BIOLOGY These graphs, together , show that most of the photosynthesis takes place in the blue and red regions of the spectrum; some photosynthesis does take place at the other wavelengths of the visible spectrum. Let us see how this happens. Though chlorophyll is the major pigment responsible for trapping light, other thylakoid pigments like chlorophyll b, xanthophylls and carotenoids, which are called accessory pigments, also absorb light and transfer the energy to chlorophyll a. Indeed, they not only enable a wider range of wavelength of incoming light to be utilised for photosyntesis but also protect chlorophyll a from photo-oxidation. 11.5 WHAT IS LIGHT REACTION ? Light reactions or the ‘Photochemical’ phase include light absorption, water splitting, oxygen release, and the formation of high-energy chemical intermediates, ATP and NADPH. Several protein complexes are involved in the process. The pigments are organised into two discrete photochemical light harvesting complexes (LHC) within the Photosystem I (PS I) and Photosystem II (PS II ). These are named in the sequence of their discovery, and not in the sequence in which they function during the light reaction. The LHC are made up of hundreds of pigment molecules bound to proteins. Each photosystem has all the pigments (except one molecule of chlorophyll a) forming a light harvesting system also called antennae (Figure 11.4). These pigments help to make photosynthesis more efficient by absorbing different wavelengths of light. The single chlorophyll a molecule forms the reaction centre. The reaction centre is different in both the photosystems. In PS I the reaction centre chlorophyll a has an absorption peak at 700 nm, hence is called P700, while in PS II it has absorption maxima at 680 nm, and is called P680 . 11.6 THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT In photosystem II the reaction centre chlorophyll a absorbs 680 nm wavelength of red light causing electrons to become excited and jump into an orbit farther from the atomic nucleus. These electrons are picked up by an electron acceptor which passes them to an electrons transportPhotonReaction centre Pigment molecules Primary acceptor Figure 11.4 The light harvesting complex 2024-25 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 139 system consisting of cytochromes (Figure 11.5). This movement of electrons is downhill, in terms of an oxidation-reduction or redox potential scale. The electrons are not used up as they pass through the electron transport chain, but are passed on to the pigments of photosystem PS I. Simultaneously, electrons in the reaction centre of PS I are also excited when they receive red light of wavelength 700 nm and are transferred to another accepter molecule that has a greater redox potential. These electrons then are moved downhill again, this time to a molecule of energy-rich NADP+. The addition of these electrons reduces NADP+ to NADPH + H+. This whole scheme of transfer of electrons, starting from the PS II, uphill to the acceptor , down the electr on transport chain to PS I, excitation of electrons, transfer to another acceptor , and finally down hill to NADP+ reducing it to NADPH + H+ is called the Z scheme , due to its characterstic shape (Figure 11.5). This shape is formed when all the carriers are placed in a sequence on a redox potential scale. 11.6.1 Splitting of Water You would then ask, How does PS II supply electr ons continuously? The electrons that were moved from photosystem II must be replaced. This is achieved by electrons available due to splitting of water . The splitting of water is associated with the PS II; water is split into 2H+, [O] and electrons. This creates oxygen, one of the net products of photosynthesis. The electrons needed to replace those removed from photosystem I are provided by photosystem II. 2 4 42 2 H O H O e  →  + ++ − We need to emphasise her e that the water splitting complex is associated with the PS II, which itself is physically located on the inner side of the membrane of the thylakoid. Then , wher e are the pr otons and O2 formed likely to be released – in the lumen ? or on the outer side of the membrane? 11.6.2 Cyclic and Non-cyclic Photo-phosphorylation Living organisms have the capability of extracting energy from oxidisable substances and store this in the form of bond energy. Special substances like ATP, carry this ener gy in their chemical bonds. The pr ocess thr ough whichElectron transport system-- eacceptoreacceptor LightPhotosystem II Photosystem I NADPH NADP+ LHCLHC H O 2e + 2H + [O]2- +ADP+iP ATP Figure 11.5 Z scheme of light reaction 2024-25 140 BIOLOGY ATP is synthesised by cells (in mitochondria and chloroplasts) is named phosphorylation. Photo- phosphorylation is the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of light. When the two photosystems work in a series, first PS II and then the PS I, a process called non-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs. The two photosystems are connected through an electron transport chain, as seen earlier – in the Z scheme. Both ATP and NADPH + H+ are synthesised by this kind of electron flow (Figure 11.5). When only PS I is functional, the electron is circulated within the photosystem and the phosphorylation occurs due to cyclic flow of electrons (Figure 11.6). A possible location where this could be happening is in the stroma lamellae. While the membrane or lamellae of the grana have both PS I and PS II the stroma lamellae membranes lack PS II as well as NADP reductase enzyme. The excited electron does not pass on to NADP+ but is cycled back to the PS I complex through the electron transport chain (Figur e 11.6). The cyclic flow hence, r esults only in the synthesis of A TP, but not of NADPH + H+. Cyclic photophosphorylation also occurs when only light of wavelengths beyond 680 nm are available for excitation. 11.6.3 Chemiosmotic Hypothesis Let us now try and understand how actually ATP is synthesised in the chloroplast. The chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain the mechanism. Like in respiration, in photosynthesis too, ATP synthesis is linked to development of a proton gradient across a membrane. This time these are the membranes of thylakoid. There is one difference though, here the proton accumulation is towards the inside of the membrane, i.e., in the lumen. In respiration, protons accumulate in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria when electrons move through the ETS (Chapter 1 2). Let us understand what causes the proton gradient across the membrane. W e need to consider again the pr ocesses that take place during the activation of electrons and their transport to determine the steps that cause a proton gradient to develop (Figure 11.7). (a)Since splitting of the water molecule takes place on the inner side of the membrane, the protons or hydrogen ions that are produced by the splitting of water accumulate within the lumen of the thylakoids.Figure 11.6 Cyclic photophosphorylationPhotosystem I Lighte-acceptor Electron transport system Chlorophyll P 700ADP+iPATP 2024-25 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 141 (b)As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported across the membrane. This happens because the primary accepter of electron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane transfers its electr on not to an electr on carrier but to an H carrier . Hence, this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while transporting an electron. When this molecule passes on its electron to the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton is released into the inner side or the lumen side of the membrane. (c)The NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the membrane. Along with electrons that come from the acceptor of electrons of PS I, protons are necessary for the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH+ H+. These protons are also removed from the stroma. Hence, within the chloroplast, protons in the stroma decrease in number , while in the lumen ther e is accumulation of pr otons. This cr eates a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane as well as a measurable decrease in pH in the lumen. Why are we so interested in the proton gradient? This gradient is important because it is the breakdown of this gradient that leads to the synthesis of A TP. The gradient is br oken down due to the movement of protons across the membrane to the stroma through the transmembraneFigure 11.7 ATP synthesis through chemiosmosis 2024-25 142 BIOLOGY channel of the CF0 of the ATP synthase. The ATP synthase enzyme consists of two parts: one called the CF0 is embedded in the thylakoid membrane and forms a transmembrane channel that carries out facilitated diffusion of protons across the membrane. The other portion is called CF1 and protrudes on the outer surface of the thylakoid membrane on the side that faces the stroma. The break down of the gradient provides enough energy to cause a conformational change in the CF1 particle of the ATP synthase, which makes the enzyme synthesise several molecules of energy- packed A TP. Chemiosmosis requires a membrane, a proton pump, a proton gradient and ATP synthase. Energy is used to pump protons across a membrane, to create a gradient or a high concentration of protons within the thylakoid lumen. ATP synthase has a channel that allows diffusion of protons back across the membrane; this releases enough energy to activate ATP synthase enzyme that catalyses the for mation of A TP. Along with the NADPH produced by the movement of electrons, the ATP will be used immediately in the biosynthetic reaction taking place in the stroma, responsible for fixing CO2, and synthesis of sugars. 11.7 WHERE ARE THE ATP AND NADPH U SED? We lear nt that the pr oducts of light r eaction ar e ATP, NADPH and O2. Of these O2 diffuses out of the chloroplast while ATP and NADPH are used to drive the processes leading to the synthesis of food, more accurately, sugars. This is the biosynthetic phase of photosynthesis. This process does not directly depend on the presence of light but is dependent on the products of the light r eaction, i.e., A TP and NADPH, besides CO2 and H2O. You may wonder how this could be verified; it is simple: immediately after light becomes unavailable, the biosynthetic process continues for some time, and then stops. If then, light is made available, the synthesis starts again. Can we, hence, say that calling the biosynthetic phase as the dark darkdark darkdark reaction reactionreaction reactionreaction is a misnomer? Discuss this amongst yourselves. Let us now see how the ATP and NADPH are used in the biosynthetic phase. W e saw earlier that CO2 is combined with H2O to pr oduce (CH2O)n or sugars. It was of interest to scientists to find out how this reaction proceeded, or rather what was the first product formed when CO2 is taken into a reaction or fixed. Just after world war II, among the several efforts to put radioisotopes to beneficial use, the work of Melvin Calvin is exemplary. The use of radioactive 14C by him in algal photosynthesis studies led to the discovery that the first CO2 fixation product was a 3-carbon organic acid. He also contributed to working out the complete biosynthetic pathway; hence it was called Calvin cycle after him. The first product identified was 3-phosphoglyceric acid or in short PGA. How many carbon atoms does it have? 2024-25 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 143 Scientists also tried to know whether all plants have PGA as the first product of CO2 fixation, or whether any other product was formed in other plants. Experiments conducted over a wide range of plants led to the discovery of another group of plants, where the first stable product of CO2 fixation was again an organic acid, but one which had 4 carbon atoms in it. This acid was identified to be oxaloacetic acid or OAA. Since then CO2 assimilation during photosynthesis was said to be of two main types: those plants in which the first product of CO2 fixation is a C3 acid (PGA), i.e., the C3 pathway, and those in which the first product was a C4 acid (OAA), i.e., the C4 pathway . These two groups of plants showed other associated characteristics that we will discuss later . 11.7.1 The Primary Acceptor of CO2 Let us now ask ourselves a question that was asked by the scientists who were struggling to understand the ‘dark reaction’. How many carbon atoms would a molecule have which after accepting (fixing) CO2, would have 3 carbons (of PGA)? The studies very unexpectedly showed that the acceptor molecule was a 5-carbon ketose sugar – ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). Did any of you think of this possibility? Do not worry; the scientists also took a long time and conducted many experiments to reach this conclusion. They also believed that since the first product was a C3 acid, the primary acceptor would be a 2-carbon compound; they spent many years trying to identify a 2-carbon compound before they discovered the 5-carbon RuBP . 11.7.2 The Calvin Cycle Calvin and his co-workers then worked out the whole pathway and showed that the pathway operated in a cyclic manner; the RuBP was regenerated. Let us now see how the Calvin pathway operates and where the sugar is synthesised. Let us at the outset understand very clearly that the Calvin pathway occurs in all photosynthetic plants ; it does not matter whether they have C3 or C4 (or any other) pathways (Figure 1 1.8). For ease of understanding, the Calvin cycle can be described under three stages: carboxylation, reduction and regeneration. 1.Carboxylation – Carboxylation is the fixation of CO2 into a stable organic intermediate. Carboxylation is the most crucial step of the Calvin cycle where CO2 is utilised for the carboxylation of RuBP . This r eaction is catalysed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylase which results in the formation of two molecules of 3 -PGA. Since this enzyme also has an oxygenation activity it would be more correct to call it RuBP carboxylase -oxygenase or RuBisCO . 2024-25 144 BIOLOGY 2.Reduction – These are a series of reactions that lead to the formation of glucose. The steps involve utilisation of 2 molecules of ATP for phosphorylation and two of NADPH for reduction per CO2 molecule fixed. The fixation of six molecules of CO2 and 6 turns of the cycle are required for the formation of one molecule of glucose from the pathway. 3.Regeneration – Regeneration of the CO2 acceptor molecule RuBP is crucial if the cycle is to continue uninterrupted. The regeneration steps r equir e one A TP for phosphorylation to for m RuBP .

It is probably to meet this difference in number of ATP and NADPH used in the dark reaction that the cyclic phosphorylation takes place. To make one molecule of glucose 6 turns of the cycle are required. Work out how many A TP and NADPH molecules will be r equir ed to make one molecule of glucose through the Calvin pathway. It might help you to understand all of this if we look at what goes in and what comes out of the Calvin cycle. In Out Six CO2One glucose 18 ATP 18 ADP 12 NADPH 12 NADP 11.8 THE C4 PATHWAY Plants that are adapted to dry tropical regions have the C4 pathway mentioned earlier . Though these plants have the C4 oxaloacetic acid as the first CO2 fixation product they use the C3 pathway or the Calvin cycle as the main biosynthetic pathway. Then, in what way are they different from C3 plants? This is a question that you may reasonably ask. C4 plants are special: They have a special type of leaf anatomy, they tolerate higher temperatures, they show a response to high light intensities, they lack a process called photorespiration and have greater productivity of biomass. Let us understand these one by one. Study vertical sections of leaves, one of a C3 plant and the other of a C4 plant. Do you notice the differences? Do both have the same types of mesophylls? Do they have similar cells around the vascular bundle sheath? The particularly large cells around the vascular bundles of the C4 plants are called bundle sheath cells , and the leaves which have such anatomy are said to have ‘Kranz’ anatomy . ‘Kranz’ means ‘wreath’ and is a reflection of the arrangement of cells. The bundle sheath cells may form several layers around the vascular bundles; they are characterised by having a large number of chloroplasts, thick walls impervious to gaseous exchange and no inter cellular spaces. Y ou may like to cut a section of the leaves of C4 plants – maize or sorghum – to observe the Kranz anatomy and the distribution of mesophyll cells. It would be interesting for you to collect leaves of diverse species of plants around you and cut vertical sections of the leaves. Observe under the microscope – look for the bundle sheath around the vascular bundles. The presence of the bundle sheath would help you identify the C4 plants. 2024-25 146 BIOLOGY Now study the pathway shown in Figure 11.9. This pathway that has been named the Hatch and Slack Pathway, is again a cyclic process. Let us study the pathway by listing the steps. The primary CO2 acceptor is a 3-carbon molecule phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and is present in the mesophyll cells. The enzyme responsible for this fixation is PEP carboxylase or PEPcase. It is important to register that the mesophyll cells lack RuBisCO enzyme. The C4 acid OAA is formed in the mesophyll cells. It then forms other 4-carbon compounds like malic acid or aspartic acid in the mesophyll cells itself, which are transported to the bundle sheath cells. In the bundle sheath cells these C4 acids are broken down to release CO2 and a 3-carbon molecule. The 3-carbon molecule is transported back to the mesophyll where it is converted to PEP again, thus, completing the cycle. The CO2 released in the bundle sheath cells enters the C3 or the Calvin pathway, a pathway common to all plants. The bundle sheath cells are Figure 11.9 Diagrammatic representation of the Hatch and Slack Pathway 2024-25 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 147 rich in an enzyme Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO) , but lack PEPcase. Thus, the basic pathway that results in the formation of the sugars, the Calvin pathway, is common to the C3 and C4 plants. Did you note that the Calvin pathway occurs in all the mesophyll cells of the C3 plants? In the C4 plants it does not take place in the mesophyll cells but does so only in the bundle sheath cells. 11.9 PHOTORESPIRATION Let us try and understand one more process that creates an important difference between C3 and C4 plants – Photorespiration . To understand photorespiration we have to know a little bit more about the first step of the Calvin pathway – the first CO2 fixation step. This is the reaction where RuBP combines with CO2 to form 2 molecules of 3PGA, that is catalysed by RuBisCO. RuBP CO PGARuBisCo+  →   ×2 2 3 RuBisCO that is the most abundant enzyme in the world (Do you wonder why?) is characterised by the fact that its active site can bind to both CO2 and O2 – hence the name. Can you think how this could be possible? RuBisCO has a much greater affinity for CO2 when the CO2: O2 is nearly equal. Imagine what would happen if this were not so! This binding is competitive. It is the relative concentration of O2 and CO2 that determines which of the two will bind to the enzyme. In C3 plants some O2 does bind to RuBisCO, and hence CO2 fixation is decreased. Here the RuBP instead of being converted to 2 molecules of PGA binds with O2 to form one molecule of phosphoglycerate and phosphoglycolate (2 Carbon) in a pathway called photorespiration. In the photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars, nor of ATP. Rather it r esults in the release of CO2 with the utilisation of ATP . In the photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH. The biological function of photorespiration is not known yet. In C4 plants photor espiration does not occur . This is because they have a mechanism that increases the concentration of CO2 at the enzyme site. This takes place when the C4 acid from the mesophyll is broken down in the bundle sheath cells to release CO2 – this results in increasing the intracellular concentration of CO2. In turn, this ensures that the RuBisCO functions as a carboxylase minimising the oxygenase activity. Now that you know that the C4 plants lack photorespiration, you probably can understand why productivity and yields are better in these plants. In addition these plants show tolerance to higher temperatures. Based on the above discussion can you compare plants showing the C3 and the C4 pathway?

The rate of photosynthesis is very important in determining the yield of plants including crop plants. Photosynthesis is under the influence of several factors, both internal (plant) and external. The plant factors include the number , size, age and orientation of leaves, mesophyll cells and chloroplasts, internal CO2 concentration and the amount of chlorophyll. The plant or internal factors are dependent on the genetic predisposition and the growth of the plant. The external factors would include the availability of sunlight, temperatur e, CO2 concentration and water . As a plant photosynthesises, all these factors will simultaneously affect its rate. Hence, though several factors interact and simultaneously affect photosynthesis or CO2 fixation, usually one factor is the major cause or is the one that limits the rate. Hence, at any point the rate will be determined by the factor available at sub-optimal levels. When several factors affect any [bio] chemical process, Blackman’s (1905) Law of Limiting Factors comes into effect. This states the following: If a chemical pr ocess is af fected by mor e than one factor , then its rate will be deter mined by the factor which is near est to its minimal value: it is the factor which directly affects the process if its quantity is changed. For example, despite the presence of a green leaf and optimal light and CO2 conditions, the plant may not photosynthesise if the temperature is very low. This leaf, if given the optimal temperature, will start photosynthesising. 11.10.1 Light We need to distinguish between light quality, light intensity and the duration of exposure to light, while discussing light as a factor that affects photosynthesis. There is a linear relationship between incident light and CO2 fixation rates at low light intensities. At higher light intensities, gradually the rate does not show further increase as other factors become limiting (Figure 11.10). What is interesting to note is that light saturation occurs at 10 per cent of the full sunlight. Hence, except for plants in shade or in dense forests, light is rarely a limiting factor in nature. Increase inFigure 11.10 Graph of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesisRate of photosynthesis Light intensityABC DE 2024-25 150 BIOLOGY incident light beyond a point causes the breakdown of chlorophyll and a decrease in photosynthesis. 11.10.2 Carbon dioxide Concentration Carbon dioxide is the major limiting factor for photosynthesis. The concentration of CO2 is very low in the atmosphere (between 0.03 and 0.04 per cent). Increase in concentration upto 0.05 per cent can cause an increase in CO2 fixation rates; beyond this the levels can become damaging over longer periods. The C3 and C4 plants respond differently to CO2 concentrations. At low light conditions neither group responds to high CO2 conditions. At high light intensities, both C3 and C4 plants show increase in the rates of photosynthesis. What is important to note is that the C4 plants show saturation at about 360 µlL-1 while C3 responds to increased CO2 concentration and saturation is seen only beyond 450 µlL-1. Thus, current availability of CO2 levels is limiting to the C3 plants. The fact that C3 plants respond to higher CO2 concentration by showing increased rates of photosynthesis leading to higher productivity has been used for some greenhouse crops such as tomatoes and bell pepper . They ar e allowed to gr ow in carbon dioxide enriched atmospher e that leads to higher yields. 11.10.3 Temperature The dark reactions being enzymatic are temperature controlled. Though the light reactions are also temperature sensitive they are affected to a much lesser extent. The C4 plants respond to higher temperatures and show higher rate of photosynthesis while C3 plants have a much lower temperature optimum. The temperature optimum for photosynthesis of different plants also depends on the habitat that they ar e adapted to. T ropical plants have a higher temperature optimum than the plants adapted to temperate climates. 11.10.4 Water Even though water is one of the reactants in the light reaction, the effect of water as a factor is more through its effect on the plant, rather than directly on photosynthesis. W ater str ess causes the stomata to close hence r educing the CO2 availability. Besides, water stress also makes leaves wilt, thus, reducing the surface area of the lea ves and their metabolic activity as well. 2024-25 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS 151 SUMMARY Green plants make their own food by photosynthesis. During this process carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is taken in by leaves through stomata and used for making carbohydrates, principally glucose and starch. Photosynthesis takes place only in the green parts of the plants, mainly the leaves. Within the leaves, the mesophyll cells have a large number of chloroplasts that are responsible for CO2 fixation. Within the chloroplasts, the membranes are sites for the light reaction, while the chemosynthetic pathway occurs in the stroma. Photosynthesis has two stages: the light reaction and the carbon fixing reactions. In the light reaction the light energy is absorbed by the pigments present in the antenna, and funnelled to special chlorophyll a molecules called reaction centre chlorophylls. There are two photosystems, PS I and PS II. PS I has a 700 nm absorbing chlorophyll a P700 molecule at its reaction centre, while PS II has a P680 reaction centre that absorbs red light at 680 nm. After absorbing light, electrons are excited and transferred through PS II and PS I and finally to NAD forming NADH. During this process a proton gradient is created across the membrane of the thylakoid. The breakdown of the protons gradient due to movement through the F0 part of the ATPase enzyme releases enough ener gy for synthesis of ATP . Splitting of water molecules is associated with PS II resulting in the release of O2, protons and transfer of electrons to PS II. In the carbon fixation cycle, CO2 is added by the enzyme, RuBisCO , to a 5- carbon compound RuBP that is converted to 2 molecules of 3-carbon PGA. This is then converted to sugar by the Calvin cycle, and the RuBP is regenerated. During this process ATP and NADPH synthesised in the light reaction are utilised. RuBisCO also catalyses a wasteful oxygenation reaction in C3 plants: photorespiration. Some tropical plants show a special type of photosynthesis called C4 pathway. In these plants the first product of CO2 fixation that takes place in the mesophyll, is a 4-carbon compound. In the bundle sheath cells the Calvin pathway is carried out for the synthesis of carbohydrates. EXERCISES 1.By looking at a plant externally can you tell whether a plant is C3 or C4? Why and how? 2.By looking at which internal structure of a plant can you tell whether a plant is C3 or C4? Explain. 3.Even though a very few cells in a C4 plant carry out the biosynthetic – Calvin pathway, yet they are highly productive.

Why do you think RuBisCO carries out more carboxylation in C4 plants? 5.Suppose there were plants that had a high concentration of Chlorophyll b, but lacked chlorophyll a , would it carry out photosynthesis? Then why do plants have chlorophyll b and other accessory pigments? 6.Why is the colour of a leaf kept in the dark frequently yellow, or pale green?

    "input": "RESPIRATION IN PLANTS153All of us breathe to live, but why is breathing so essential to life? Whathappens when we breathe? Also, do all living organisms, including plantsand microbes, breathe? If so, how?All living organisms need energy for carrying out daily life activities,be it absorption, transport, movement, reproduction or even breathing.\nWhere does all this energy come from? We know we eat food for energy –but how is this energy taken from food?  How is this energy utilised? Doall foods give the same amount of energy? Do plants ‘eat’? Where do plantsget their energy from? And micro-organisms – for their energyrequirements, do they eat ‘food’?You may wonder at the several questions raised above – they mayseem to be very disconnected.  But in reality, the process of breathing is\nvery much connected to the process of release of energy from food.  Let us\ntry and understand how this happens.All the energy required for ‘life’ processes is obtained by oxidation ofsome macromolecules that we call ‘food’. Only green plants and\ncyanobacteria can prepare their own food; by the process of photosynthesisthey trap light energy and convert it into chemical energy that is stored inthe bonds of carbohydrates like glucose, sucrose and starch.  We mustremember that in green plants too, not all cells, tissues and organsphotosynthesise; only cells containing chloroplasts, that are most oftenlocated in the superficial layers, carry out photosynthesis.  Hence, even\nin green plants all other organs, tissues and cells that are non-green,need food for oxidation. Hence, food has to be translocated to all non-green parts. Animals are heterotrophic, i.e., they obtain food from plantsRESPIRATION IN PLANTSCHAPTER  1212.1Do Plants\nBreathe?12.2Glycolysis12.3Fermentation12.4Aerobic\nRespiration12.5The\nRespiratory\nBalance Sheet12.6Amphibolic\nPathway12.7RespiratoryQuotient154BIOLOGYdirectly (herbivores) or indirectly (carnivores). Saprophytes like fungi aredependent on dead and decaying matter.  What is important to recogniseis that ultimately all the food that is respired for life processes comes fromphotosynthesis. This chapter deals with cellular respiration or themechanism of breakdown of food materials within the cell to release\nenergy, and the trapping of this energy for synthesis of ATP.Photosynthesis, of course, takes place within the chloroplasts (in theeukaryotes), whereas the breakdown of complex molecules to yield energy\ntakes place in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria  (also only in\neukaryotes).  The breaking of the C-C bonds of complex compoundsthrough oxidation within the cells, leading to release of considerableamount of energy is called respiration.  The compounds that are oxidisedduring this process are known as respiratory substrates. Usuallycarbohydrates are oxidised to release energy, but proteins, fats and even\norganic acids can be used as respiratory substances in some plants, under\ncertain conditions.  During oxidation within a cell, all the energy containedin respiratory substrates is not released free into the cell, or in a singlestep. It is released in a series of slow step-wise reactions controlled by\nenzymes, and it is trapped as chemical energy in the form of ATP.  Hence,it is important to understand that the energy released by oxidation in\nrespiration is not (or rather cannot be) used directly but is used to\nsynthesise ATP, which is broken down whenever (and wherever) energyneeds to be utilised. Hence, ATP acts as the energy currency of the cell.\nThis energy trapped in ATP is utilised in various energy-requiring\nprocesses of the organisms, and the carbon skeleton produced duringrespiration is used as precursors for biosynthesis of other molecules inthe cell.12.1DO PLANTS BREATHE?Well, the answer to this question is not quite so direct.  Yes, plants requireO2 for respiration to occur and they also give out CO2.  Hence, plants havesystems in place that ensure the availability of O2.  Plants, unlike animals,have no specialised organs for gaseous exchange but they have stomataand lenticels for this purpose. There are several reasons why plants canget along without respiratory organs. First, each plant part takes care of\nits own gas-exchange needs.  There is very little transport of gases fromone plant part to another.  Second, plants do not present great demandsfor gas exchange.  Roots, stems and leaves respire at rates far lower thananimals do. Only during photosynthesis are large volumes of gasesexchanged and, each leaf is well adapted to take care of its own needsduring these periods. When cells photosynthesise, availability of O2 is nota problem in these cells since O2 is released within the cell.  Third, theRESPIRATION IN PLANTS155distance that gases must diffuse even in large, bulky plants is not great.Each living cell in a plant is located quite close to the surface of the plant.‘This is true for leaves’, you may ask, ‘but what about thick, woody stems\nand roots?’ In stems, the ‘living’ cells are organised in thin layers insideand beneath the bark. They also have openings called lenticels. The cellsin the interior are dead and provide only mechanical support. Thus, most\ncells of a plant have at least a part of their surface in contact with air. Thisis also facilitated by the loose packing of parenchyma cells in leaves, stems\nand roots, which provide an interconnected network of air spaces.The complete combustion of glucose, which produces CO2 and H2Oas end products, yields energy most of which is given out as heat.CHOOCOHOEnergy6126222666+→++If this energy is to be useful to the cell, it should be αble to utilise it tosynthesise other molecules thαt the cell requires.

The combustion\nreαction requires oxygen. But some cells live where oxygen mαy or mαynot be αvαilαble. Can you think of such situations (and organisms) whereO2 is not available?   There are sufficient reasons to believe that the firstcells on this planet lived in an atmosphere that lacked oxygen.  Even\namong present-day living organisms, we know of several that are adaptedto anaerobic conditions.  Some of these organisms are facultative\nanaerobes, while in others the requirement for anaerobic condition isobligate.  In any case, all living organisms retain the enzymatic machineryto partially oxidise glucose without the help of oxygen.  This breakdown\nof glucose to pyruvic acid is called glycolysis.12.2GLYCOLYSISThe term glycolysis has originated from the Greek words, glycos for sugar,and lysis for splitting.  The scheme of glycolysis was given by GustavEmbden, Otto Meyerhof, and J. Parnas, and is often referred to as theEMP pathway. In anaerobic organisms, it is the only process in respiration.Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and is present in all living\norganisms.  In this process, glucose undergoes partial oxidation to formtwo molecules of pyruvic acid. In plants, this glucose is derived fromsucrose, which is the end product of photosynthesis, or from storage156BIOLOGYcarbohydrates. Sucrose is converted into glucoseand fructose by the enzyme, invertase, and thesetwo monosaccharides readily enter the glycolyticpathway. Glucose and fructose arephosphorylated to give rise to glucose-6-phosphate by the activity of the enzyme\nhexokinase. This phosphorylated form ofglucose then isomerises to produce fructose-6-phosphate. Subsequent steps of metabolism ofglucose and fructose are same.  The varioussteps of glycolysis are depicted in Figure 12.1.In glycolysis, a chain of ten reactions, under thecontrol of different enzymes, takes place toproduce pyruvate from glucose. While studyingthe steps of glycolysis, please note the steps at\nwhich utilisation or synthesis of ATP or (in thiscase) NADH + H+ take place.ATP is utilised at two steps: first in theconversion of glucose into glucose 6-phosphate\nand second in the conversion of fructose6-phosphate to fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate.The fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate is splitinto dihydroxyacetone phosphate and\n3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL). We findthat there is one step where NADH + H+ isformed from NAD+; this is when3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) is converted\nto 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPGA).  Tworedox-equivalents are removed (in the form oftwo hydrogen atoms) from PGAL and transferred\nto a molecule of NAD+. PGAL is oxidised andwith inorganic phosphate to get converted into\nBPGA. The conversion of BPGA to\n3-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA), is also an energyyielding process; this energy is trapped by theformation of ATP.  Another ATP is synthesisedduring the conversion of PEP to pyruvic acid.Can you then calculate how many ATPCan you then calculate how many ATPCan you then calculate how many ATPCan you then calculate how many ATPCan you then calculate how many ATPmolecules are directly synthesised in thismolecules are directly synthesised in thismolecules are directly synthesised in thismolecules are directly synthesised in thismolecules are directly synthesised in thispathway from one glucose molecule?pathway from one glucose molecule?pathway from one glucose molecule?pathway from one glucose molecule?pathway from one glucose molecule?Pyruvic acid is then the key product ofglycolysis.

These are lactic acid fermentation, alcoholicfermentation and aerobic respiration. Fermentation takes place underanaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes.For the complete oxidation of glucose to CO2 and H2O, however, organismsadopt Krebs’ cycle which is also called as aerobic respiration. This requiresO2 supply.12.3FERMENTATIONIn fermentation, say by yeast, the incomplete oxidation of glucose isachieved under anaerobic conditions by sets of reactions where pyruvicacid is converted to CO2 and ethanol. The enzymes, pyruvic aciddecarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase catalyse these reactions. Otherorganisms like some bacteria produce lactic acid from pyruvic acid.  Thesteps involved are shown in Figure 12.2. In animal cells also, like musclesduring exercise, when oxygen is inadequate for cellular respiration pyruvicacid is reduced to lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase.  The reducing\nagent is NADH+H+  which is reoxidised to NAD+in both the processes.In both lactic acid and alcoholfermentation not much energy is released; less\nthan seven per cent of the energy in glucose isreleased and not all of it is trapped as highenergy bonds of ATP.  Also, the processes arehazardous – either acid or alcohol is produced.What is the net ATPs that is synthesised(calculate how many ATP are synthesised and\ndeduct the number of ATP utilised duringglycolysis) when one molecule of glucose is\nfermented to alcohol or lactic acid?

In eukaryotes these steps take place within the mitochondriaand this requires O2. Aerobic respiration is the process that leads to acomplete oxidation of organic substances in the presence of oxygen, and\nreleases CO2, water and a large amount of energy present in the substrate.This type of respiration is most common in higher organisms. We willlook at these processes in the next section.12.4AEROBIC RESPIRATIONFor aerobic respiration to take place within the mitochondria, the finalproduct of glycolysis, pyruvate is transported from the cytoplasm intothe mitochondria.  The crucial events in aerobic respiration are:•The complete oxidation of pyruvate by the stepwise removal of allthe hydrogen atoms, leaving three molecules of CO2.•The passing on of the electrons removed as part of the hydrogenatoms to molecular O2  with simultaneous synthesis of ATP.What is interesting to note is that the first process takes place in thematrix of the mitochondria while the second process is located on the\ninner membrane of the mitochondria.Pyruvate, which is formed by the glycolytic catabolism of carbohydratesin the cytosol, after it enters mitochondrial matrix undergoes oxidativedecarboxylation by a complex set of reactions catalysed by pyruvicdehydrogenase. The reactions catalysed by pyruvic dehydrogenase requirethe participation of several coenzymes, including NAD+ and  Coenzyme A.PyruvicacidCoANADMgPyruvatedehydrogenase++→++2++++AcetylCoACONADHH2During this process, two molecules of NADH are produced from themetabolism of two molecules of pyruvic acid (produced from one glucose\nmolecule during glycolysis).The acetyl CoA then enters a cyclic pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle,more commonly called as Krebs’ cycle after the scientist Hans Krebs whofirst elucidated it.12.4.1Tricarboxylic Acid CycleThe TCA cycle starts with the condensation of acetyl group with oxaloaceticacid (OAA) and water to yield citric acid (Figure 12.3). The reaction iscatalysed by the enzyme citrate synthase and a molecule of CoA is released.\nCitrate is then isomerised to isocitrate.  It is followed by two successivesteps of decarboxylation, leading to the formation of α-ketoglutaric acidRESPIRATION IN PLANTS159PyruvicacidNADFADHOADPPiMitochondrialMatrix+++++→++422+++3442CONADHHand then succinyl-CoA.  In the remaining stepsof citric acid cycle, succinyl-CoA is oxidised toOAA allowing the cycle to continue. During theconversion of succinyl-CoA to succinic acid amolecule of GTP is synthesised. This is asubstrate level phosphorylation.  In a coupledreaction GTP is converted to GDP with thesimultaneous synthesis of ATP from ADP.Also there are three points in the cycle whereNAD+ is reduced to NADH + H+ and one pointwhere FAD+ is reduced to FADH2. Thecontinued oxidation of acetyl CoA via the TCAcycle requires the continued replenishment ofoxaloacetic acid, the first member of the cycle.\nIn addition it also requires regeneration ofNAD+ and FAD+ from NADH and FADH2respectively. The summary equation for this\nphase of respiration may be written as follows:++2FADHATPWe have till now seen that glucose has been broken down to releaseCO2 and eight molecules of NADH + H+; two of  FADH2 have beensynthesised besides just two molecules of ATP in TCA cycle.  You may bewondering why we have been discussing respiration at all – neither O2has come into the picture nor the promised large number of ATP has yetbeen synthesised. Also what is the role of the NADH + H+ and FADH2 thatis synthesised? Let us now understand the role of O2 in respiration andhow ATP is synthesised.12.4.2Electron Transport System (ETS) and OxidativePhosphorylationThe following steps in the respiratory process are to release and utilisethe energy stored in NADH+H+ and FADH2.  This is accomplished whenthey are oxidised through the electron transport system and the electrons\nare passed on to O2 resulting in the formation of H2O.  The metabolicpathway through which the electron passes from one carrier to another,is called the electron transport systemelectron transport systemelectron transport systemelectron transport systemelectron transport system (ETS) (Figure 12.4) and it ispresent in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Cytochrome c is asmall protein attached to the outersurface of the inner membrane and acts\nas a mobile carrier for transfer of\nelectrons between complex III and IV.Complex IV refers to cytochrome coxidase complex containing cytochromes\na and a3, and two copper centres.When the electrons pass from onecarrier to another via complex I to IV inthe electron transport chain, they arecoupled to ATP synthase (complex V) forthe production of ATP from ADP andinorganic phosphate. The number of ATP\nmolecules synthesised depends on thenature of the electron donor. Oxidationof one molecule of NADH gives rise to 3\nmolecules of ATP, while that of onemolecule of FADH2 produces 2 moleculesof ATP. Although the aerobic process ofrespiration takes place only in thepresence of oxygen, the role of oxygen islimited to the terminal stage of theprocess.  Yet, the presence of oxygen isvital, since it drives the whole process by removing hydrogen from the\nsystem. Oxygen acts as the final hydrogen acceptor. Unlikephotophosphorylation where it is the light energy that is utilised for theproduction of proton gradient required for phosphorylation, in respirationit is the energy of oxidation-reduction utilised for the same process. It isfor this reason that the process is called oxidative phosphorylation.You have already studied about the mechanism of membrane-linkedATP synthesis as explained by chemiosmotic hypothesis in the earlierchapter.  As mentioned earlier, the energy released during the electronFigure 12.4 Electron Transport System (ETS)RESPIRATION IN PLANTS161transport system is utilised in synthesising ATPwith the help of ATP synthase (complex V).  Thiscomplex consists of two major components, F1and F0 (Figure 12.5).  The F1 headpiece is aperipheral membrane protein complex andcontains the site for synthesis of ATP from ADPand inorganic phosphate. F0 is an integralmembrane protein complex that forms the\nchannel through which protons cross the innermembrane.  The passage of protons throughthe channel is coupled to the catalytic site ofthe F1 component for the production of ATP.For each ATP produced, 4H+ passes throughF0 from the intermembrane space to the matrixdown the electrochemical proton gradient.12.5 THE RESPIRATORY BALANCE SHEETIt is possible to make calculations of the net gain of ATP for every glucosemolecule  oxidised; but in reality this can remain only a theoretical exercise.These calculations can be made only on certain assumptions that:•There is a sequential, orderly pathway functioning, with onesubstrate forming the next and with glycolysis, TCA cycle and ETSpathway following one after another.•The NADH synthesised in glycolysis is transferred into themitochondria and undergoes oxidative phosphorylation.•None of the intermediates in the pathway are utilised to synthesiseany other compound.•Only glucose is being respired – no other alternative substrates areentering in the pathway at any of the intermediary stages.But this kind of assumptions are not really valid in a living system; allpathways work simultaneously and do not take place one after another;substrates enter the pathways and are withdrawn from it as and whennecessary; ATP is utilised as and when needed;  enzymatic rates arecontrolled by multiple means.  Yet, it is useful to do this exercise toappreciate the beauty and efficiency of the living system in extraction\nand storing energy. Hence, there can be a net gain of 38 ATP moleculesduring aerobic respiration of one molecule of glucose.Figure 12.5  Diagramatic presentation of ATPsynthesis in mitochondria162BIOLOGYNow let us  compare  fermentation and aerobic respiration:•Fermentation accounts for only a partial breakdown of glucosewhereas in aerobic respiration it is completely degraded to CO2 andH2O.•In fermentation there is a net gain of only two molecules of ATP for\neach molecule of glucose degraded to pyruvic acid whereas many\nmore molecules of ATP are generated under aerobic conditions.•NADH is oxidised to NAD+ rather slowly in fermentation, howeverthe reaction is very vigorous in case of aerobic respiration.12.6AMPHIBOLIC PATHWAYGlucose is the favoured substrate for respiration.  All carbohydrates areusually first converted into glucose before they are used for respiration.Other substrates can also be respired, as has been mentioned earlier, butthen they do not enter the respiratory pathway at the first step. See Figure12.6 to see the points of entry of different substrates in the respiratorypathway. Fats would need to be broken down into glycerol and fatty acids\nfirst. If fatty acids were to be respired they would first be degraded toacetyl CoA and enter the pathway. Glycerol would enter the pathwayafter being converted to PGAL. The proteins would be degraded by\nproteases and the individual amino acids (after deamination) dependingon their structure would enter the pathway at some stage within the Krebs’cycle or even as pyruvate or acetyl CoA.Since respiration involves breakdown of substrates, the respiratoryprocess has traditionally been considered a catabolic process and the\nrespiratory pathway as a catabolic pathway.  But is this understanding\ncorrect?  We have discussed above, at which points in the respiratorypathway different substrates would enter if they were to be respired and\nused to derive energy. What is important to recognise is that it is these verycompounds that would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for thesynthesis of the said substrates. Hence, fatty acids would be broken downto acetyl CoA before entering the respiratory pathway when it is used as a\nsubstrate. But when the organism needs to synthesise fatty acids, acetylCoA would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for it. Hence, therespiratory pathway comes into the picture both during breakdown and\nsynthesis of fatty acids. Similarly, during breakdown and synthesis ofprotein too, respiratory intermediates form the link. Breaking down\nprocesses within the living organism is catabolism, and synthesis is\nanabolism.  Because the respiratory pathway is involved in both anabolismand catabolism, it would hence be better to consider the respiratory pathwayas an amphibolic pathway rather than as a catabolic one.RESPIRATION IN PLANTS16312.7RESPIRATORY QUOTIENTLet us now look at another aspect of respiration. As you know, duringaerobic respiration, O2 is consumed and CO2 is released. The ratio of thevolume of CO2 evolved to the volume of O2 consumed in respiration iscalled the respiratory quotient (RQ) or respiratory ratio.RQvolumeofCOevolvedvolumeofOconsumed=22The respiratory quotient depends upon the type of respiratorysubstrate used during respiration.When carbohydrates are used as substrate and are completelyoxidised, the RQ will be 1, because equal amounts of CO2 and O2 areevolved and consumed, respectively, as shown in the equation below :Figure 12.6Interrelationship among metabolic pathways showing respirationmediated breakdown of different organic molecules to CO2 and H20164BIOLOGYCHOOCOHOEnergy6126222666+→++RQCOO==661022.When fats are used in respiration, the RQ is less than 1.

Almost all living cells\nin a plant have their surfaces exposed to air.The breaking of C-C bonds of complex organic molecules by oxidation cellsleading to the release of a lot of energy is called cellular respiration. Glucose is the\nfavoured substrate for respiration. Fats and proteins can also be broken down toyield energy. The initial stage of cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm.Each glucose molecule is broken through a series of enzyme catalysed reactions\ninto two molecules of pyruvic acid. This process is called glycolysis. The fate of thepyruvate depends on the availability of oxygen and the organism. Under anaerobicconditions either lactic acid fermentation or alcohol fermentation occurs.\nFermentation takes place under anaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes,unicellular eukaryotes and in germinating seeds. In eukaryotic organisms aerobicrespiration occurs  in the presence of oxygen. Pyruvic acid is transported into the\nmitochondria where it is converted into acetyl CoA with the release of CO2. AcetylCoA then enters the tricarboxylic acid pathway or Krebs’ cycle operating in the\nmatrix of the mitochondria. NADH + H+ and FADH2 are generated in the Krebs’cycle. The energy in these molecules as well as that in the NADH + H+ synthesisedduring glycolysis are used to synthesise ATP. This is accomplished through aRESPIRATION IN PLANTS165system of electron carriers called electron transport system (ETS) located on theinner membrane of the mitochondria. The electrons, as they move through thesystem, release enough energy that are trapped to synthesise ATP. This is calledoxidative phosphorylation. In this process O2 is the ultimate acceptor of electronsand it gets reduced to water.The respiratory pathway is an amphibolic pathway as it involves both anabolismand catabolism. The respiratory quotient depends upon the type of respiratorysubstance used during respiration.EXERCISES1.Differentiate between(a) Respiration and Combustion(b) Glycolysis and Krebs’ cycle(c) Aerobic respiration and Fermentation2.What are respiratory substrates?

    "input": "166 BIOLOGY You have alr eady studied the or ganisation of a flowering plant in Chapter 5. Have you ever thought about where and how the structures like roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds arise and that too in an orderly sequence? Y ou ar e, by now, awar e of the ter ms seed, seedling, plantlet, matur e plant. Y ou have also seen that tr ees continue to incr ease in height or girth over a period of time. However , the leaves, flowers and fruits of the same tree not only have limited dimensions but also appear and fall periodically and some time repeatedly. Why does vegetative phase precede flowering in a plant? All plant organs are made up of a variety of tissues; is there any relationship between the structure of a cell, a tissue, an organ and the function they perform? Can the structure and the function of these be altered? All cells of a plant are descendents of the zygote. The question is, then, why and how do they have different structural and functional attributes? Development is the sum of two processes: growth and differentiation. To begin with, it is essential and sufficient to know that the development of a mature plant from a zygote (fertilised egg) follow a precise and highly ordered succession of events. During this process a complex body organisation is formed that produces roots, leaves, branches, flowers, fruits, and seeds, and eventually they die (Figure 1 3.1). The first step in the process of plant growth is seed germination. The seed germinates when favourable conditions for growth exist in the environment. In absence of such favourable conditions the seeds do not germinate and goes into a period of suspended growth or rest. Once favourable conditions return, the seeds resume metabolic activities and growth takes place. In this chapter , you shall also study some of the factors which govern and control these developmental processes. These factors are both intrinsic (internal) and extrinsic (external) to the plant.PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENTCHAPTER 13 13.1 Growth 13.2 Differentiation, Dedifferentiation and Redifferentiation 13.3 Development 13.4 Plant Growth Regulators 2024-25 PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 167 13.1 GROWTH Growth is regarded as one of the most fundamental and conspicuous characteristics of a living being. What is growth? Growth can be defined as an irreversible permanent increase in size of an organ or its parts or even of an individual cell. Generally, growth is accompanied by metabolic processes (both anabolic and catabolic), that occur at the expense of energy. Therefore, for example, expansion of a leaf is growth. How would you describe the swelling of piece of wood when placed in water? 13.1.1 Plant Growth Generally is Indeterminate Plant growth is unique because plants retain the capacity for unlimited growth throughout their life. This ability of the plants is due to the presence of meristems at certain locations in their body. The cells of such meristems have the capacity to divide and self-perpetuate. The product, however , soon loses the capacity to divide and such cells make up the plant body. This form of growth wherein new cells are always being added to the plant body by the activity of the meristem is called the open form of growth. What would happen if the meristem ceases to divide? Does this ever happen? In earlier classes, you have studied about the root apical meristem and the shoot apical meristem. Y ou know that they ar e responsible for Seed coatEpicotyl hook CotyledonsCotyledon Soil lineEpicotyl Hypocotyl Hypocotyl Figure 13.1 Germination and seedling development in bean 2024-25 168 BIOLOGY the primary growth of the plants and principally contribute to the elongation of the plants along their axis. Y ou also know that in dicotyledonous plants and gymnosperms, the lateral meristems, vascular cambium and cork-cambium appear later in life. These are the meristems that cause the increase in the girth of the organs in which they are active. This is known as secondary growth of the plant (see Figure 13.2). 13.1.2 Growth is Measurable Growth, at a cellular level, is principally a consequence of increase in the amount of protoplasm. Since increase in protoplasm is difficult to measure directly, one generally measures some quantity which is more or less proportional to it. Growth is, therefore, measured by a variety of parameters some of which are: increase in fresh weight, dry weight, length, ar ea, volume and cell number . You may find it amazing to know that one single maize root apical mersitem can give rise to more than 17,500 new cells per hour , wher eas cells in a watermelon may increase in size by upto 3,50,000 times. In the for mer, growth is expressed as increase in cell number; the latter expresses growth as increase in size of the cell. While the growth of a pollen tube is measured in terms of its length, an increase in surface area denotes the growth in a dorsiventral leaf. 13.1.3 Phases of Growth The period of growth is generally divided into three phases, namely, meristematic, elongation and maturation (Figure 13.3). Let us understand this by looking at the root tips. The constantly dividing cells, both at the root apex and the shoot apex, represent the meristematic phase of growth. The cells in this region are rich in protoplasm, possess large conspicuous nuclei. Their cell walls are primary in nature, thin and cellulosic with abundant plasmodesmatal connections. The cells proximal (just next, away from the tip) to theShoot apical meristem Vascular cambium Vascular cambium Root apical meristemShoot Root Figure 13.2 Diagrammatic representation of locations of root apical meristem, shoot aplical meristem and vascular cambium.

Zones A, B, C, D immediately behind the apex have elongated most. 2024-25 PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 169 meristematic zone represent the phase of elongation. Increased vacuolation, cell enlargement and new cell wall deposition are the characteristics of the cells in this phase. Further away from the apex, i.e., more proximal to the phase of elongation, lies the portion of axis which is undergoing the phase of maturation. The cells of this zone, attain their maximal size in terms of wall thickening and protoplasmic modifications. Most of the tissues and cell types you have studied in earlier classes represent this phase. 13.1.4 Growth Rates The increased growth per unit time is termed as growth rate. Thus, rate of growth can be expressed mathematically. An organism, or a part of the organism can produce more cells in a variety of ways. Figure13.4 Diagrammatic representation of : (a) Arithmetic (b) Geometric growth and (c) Stages during embryo development showing geometric and arithematic phases 2024-25 170 BIOLOGY The growth rate shows an increase that may be arithmetic or geometrical (Figure 13.4). In arithmetic growth, following mitotic cell division, only one daughter cell continues to divide while the other differentiates and matures. The simplest expression of arithmetic growth is exemplified by a root elongating at a constant rate. Look at Figure 13.5. On plotting the length of the organ against time, a linear curve is obtained. Mathematically, it is expressed as Lt = L0 + rt Lt = length at time ‘t’ L0 = length at time ‘zero’ r = growth rate / elongation per unit time. Let us now see what happens in geometrical growth. In most systems, the initial growth is slow (lag phase), and it increases rapidly thereafter – at an exponential rate (log or exponential phase). Here, both the progeny cells following mitotic cell division retain the ability to divide and continue to do so. However , with limited nutrient supply, the growth slows down leading to a stationary phase. If we plot the parameter of growth against time, we get a typical sigmoid or S-curve (Figure 13.6). A sigmoid curve is a characteristic of living organism growing in a natural environment. It is typical for all cells, tissues and organs of a plant. Can you think of more similar examples? What kind of a curve can you expect in a tree showing seasonal activities? The exponential growth can be expressed as W1 = W0 ert W1 = final size (weight, height, number etc.) W0 = initial size at the beginning of the period r = growth rate t = time of growth e = base of natural logarithms Here, r is the relative growth rate and is also the measure of the ability of the plant to produce new plant material, referred to as efficiency index. Hence, the final size of W1 depends on the initial size, W0.Figure 13.5 Constant linear growth, a plot of length L against time t Figure 13.6 An idealised sigmoid growth curve typical of cells in culture, and many higher plants and plant organsSize/weight of the organ Exponential phase Lag phase TimeStationary phase 2024-25 PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 171 Quantitative comparisons between the growth of living system can also be made in two ways : (i) measurement and the comparison of total growth per unit time is called the absolute growth rate. (ii) The growth of the given system per unit time expressed on a common basis, e.g., per unit initial parameter is called the relative growth rate. In Figure 13.7 two leaves, A and B, are drawn that are of different sizes but shows absolute incr ease in ar ea in the given time to give leaves, A1 and B1. However , one of them shows much higher relative growth rate. Which one and why? 13.1.5 Conditions for Growth Why do you not try to write down what you think are necessary conditions for growth? This list may have water , oxygen and nutrients as very essential elements for growth. The plant cells grow in size by cell enlargement which in tur n requir es water . Turgidity of cells helps in extension gr owth. Thus, plant growth and further development is intimately linked to the water status of the plant. W ater also provides the medium for enzymatic activities needed for growth. Oxygen helps in releasing metabolic energy essential for growth activities. Nutrients (macro and micro essential elements) are required by plants for the synthesis of protoplasm and act as source of energy. In addition, every plant organism has an optimum temperature range best suited for its growth. Any deviation from this range could be detrimental to its survival. Environmental signals such as light and gravity also affect certain phases/stages of growth.Figure13.7 Diagrammatic comparison of absolute and relative growth rates. Both leaves A and B have increased their area by 5 cm2 in a given time to produce A1, B1 leaves. 2024-25 172 BIOLOGY 13.2 DIFFERENTIATION , DEDIFFERENTIATION AND REDIFFERENTIATION The cells derived from root apical and shoot-apical meristems and cambium differentiate and mature to perform specific functions. This act leading to maturation is termed as differentiation . During differentiation, cells undergo few to major structural changes both in their cell walls and protoplasm. For example, to form a tracheary element, the cells would lose their protoplasm. They also develop a very strong, elastic, lignocellulosic secondary cell walls, to carry water to long distances even under extr eme tension. T ry to correlate the various anatomical featur es you encounter in plants to the functions they perform. Plants show another interesting phenomenon. The living differentiated cells, that by now have lost the capacity to divide can regain the capacity of division under certain conditions. This phenomenon is termed as dedifferentiation . For example, formation of meristems – interfascicular cambium and cork cambium from fully differentiated parenchyma cells. While doing so, such meristems/tissues are able to divide and produce cells that once again lose the capacity to divide but mature to perform specific functions, i.e., get redifferentiated . List some of the tissues in a woody dicotyledenous plant that are the products of redifferentiation. How would you describe a tumour? What would you call the parenchyma cells that are made to divide under controlled laboratory conditions during plant tissue culture? Recall, in Section 13.1.1, we have mentioned that the growth in plants is open, i.e., it can be indeterminate or determinate. Now, we may say that even differentiation in plants is open, because cells/tissues arising out of the same meristem have different structures at maturity. The final structure at maturity of a cell/tissue is also determined by the location of the cell within. For example, cells positioned away from root apical meristems differentiate as root-cap cells, while those pushed to the periphery mature as epidermis. Can you add a few more examples of open differentiation correlating the position of a cell to its position in an organ? 13.3 DEVELOPMENT Development is a term that includes all changes that an organism goes through during its life cycle from germination of the seed to senescence. Diagrammatic representation of the sequence of processes which constitute the development of a cell of a higher plant is given in Figure 13.8. It is also applicable to tissues/organs. 2024-25 PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 173 Plants follow different pathways in response to environment or phases of life to form different kinds of structures. This ability is called plasticity, e.g., heterophylly in cotton, coriander and larkspur . In such plants, the leaves of the juvenile plant are different in shape from those in mature plants. On the other hand, difference in shapes of leaves produced in air and those produced in water in buttercup also represent the heterophyllous development due to environment (Figure 13.9). This phenomenon of heterophylly is an example of plasticity.Figure 13.8 Sequence of the developmental process in a plant cellCell Division Death Plasmatic growth Differentiation Expansion (Elongation)MaturationMERISTEMATIC CELLSENESCENCE MATURE CELL Figure 13.9 Heterophylly in (a) larkspur and (b) buttercup 2024-25 174 BIOLOGY Thus, growth, differentiation and development are very closely related events in the life of a plant. Broadly, development is considered as the sum of growth and differentiation. Development in plants (i.e., both growth and differentiation) is under the control of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The former includes both intracellular (genetic) or intercellular factors (chemicals such as plant growth regulators) while the latter includes light, temperatur e, water , oxygen, nutrition, etc. 13.4 PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS 13.4.1 Characteristics The plant growth regulators (PGRs) are small, simple molecules of diverse chemical composition. They could be indole compounds (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA); adenine derivatives (N6-furfurylamino purine, kinetin), derivatives of carotenoids (abscisic acid, ABA); terpenes (gibberellic acid, GA3) or gases (ethylene, C2H4). Plant growth regulators are variously described as plant growth substances, plant hormones or phytohormones in literature. The PGRs can be broadly divided into two groups based on their functions in a living plant body. One group of PGRs are involved in growth promoting activities, such as cell division, cell enlargement, pattern formation, tropic growth, flowering, fruiting and seed formation. These are also called plant growth promoters, e.g., auxins, gibberellins and cytokinins. The PGRs of the other group play an important role in plant responses to wounds and stresses of biotic and abiotic origin. They are also involved in various growth inhibiting activities such as dormancy and abscission. The PGR abscisic acid belongs to this group. The gaseous PGR, ethylene, could fit either of the groups, but it is largely an inhibitor of growth activities. 13.4.2 The Discovery of Plant Growth Regulators Interestingly, the discovery of each of the five major groups of PGRs have been accidental. All this started with the observation of Charles Darwin and his son Francis Darwin when they observed that the coleoptiles of canary grass responded to unilateral illumination by growing towards the light source (phototropism). After a series of experiments, it was concluded that the tip of coleoptile was the site of transmittable influence that caused the bending of the entire coleoptile (Figure 13.10). Auxin was isolated by F .W. Went fr om tips of coleoptiles of oat seedlings.Figure 13.10 Experiment used to demonstrate that tip of the coleoptile is the source of auxin. Arrows indicate direction of light a b c d 2024-25 PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 175 The ‘bakanae’ (foolish seedling) disease of rice seedlings, was caused by a fungal pathogen Gibberella fujikuroi . E. Kurosawa (1926) reported the appearance of symptoms of the disease in rice seedlings when they were treated with sterile filtrates of the fungus. The active substances were later identified as gibberellic acid. F. Skoog and his co-workers observed that fr om the inter nodal segments of tobacco stems the callus (a mass of undifferentiated cells) proliferated only if, in addition to auxins the nutrients medium was supplemented with one of the following: extracts of vascular tissues, yeast extract, coconut milk or DNA. Miller et al. (1955), later identified and crystallised the cytokinesis promoting active substance that they termed kinetin. During mid-1960s, three independent researches reported the purification and chemical characterisation of three different kinds of inhibitors: inhibitor -B, abscission II and dor min. Later all the thr ee wer e proved to be chemically identical. It was named abscisic acid (ABA). H.H. Cousins (1910) confirmed the release of a volatile substance from ripened oranges that hastened the ripening of stored unripened bananas. Later this volatile substance was identified as ethylene, a gaseous PGR. Let us study some of the physiological effects of these five categories of PGRs in the next section. 13.4.3 Physiological Effects of Plant Growth Regulators 13.4.3.113.4.3.113.4.3.1 13.4.3.113.4.3.1 Auxins AuxinsAuxins AuxinsAuxins Auxins (from Greek ‘auxein’ : to grow) was first isolated from human urine. The term ‘auxin’ is applied to the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and to other natural and synthetic compounds having certain growth regulating properties. They are generally produced by the growing apices of the stems and roots, from where they migrate to the regions of their action. Auxins like IAA and indole butyric acid (IBA) have been isolated from plants. NAA (naphthalene acetic acid) and 2, 4-D (2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic) are synthetic auxins. All these auxins have been used extensively in agricultural and horticultural practices. They help to initiate rooting in stem cuttings, an application widely used for plant propagation. Auxins promote flowering e.g. in pineapples. They help to prevent fruit and leaf drop at early stages but promote the abscission of older mature leaves and fruits. In most higher plants, the growing apical bud inhibits the growth of the lateral (axillary) buds, a phenomenon called apical dominance . Removal of shoot tips (decapitation) usually results in the growth of lateral buds (Figure 13.11). It is widely applied in tea plantations, hedge-making. Can you explain why? 2024-25 176 BIOLOGY Auxins also induce parthenocarpy, e.g., in tomatoes. They are widely used as herbicides. 2, 4-D, widely used to kill dicotyledonous weeds, does not affect mature monocotyledonous plants. It is used to prepare weed-free lawns by gardeners. Auxin also controls xylem differentiation and helps in cell division. 13.4.3.2 13.4.3.213.4.3.213.4.3.213.4.3.2 GibberellinsGibberellinsGibberellinsGibberellinsGibberellins Gibberellins are another kind of promotory PGR. There are more than 100 gibberellins reported from widely different organisms such as fungi and higher plants. They are denoted as GA1, GA2, GA3 and so on. However , Gibberellic acid (GA3) was one of the first gibberellins to be discovered and remains the most intensively studied form. All GAs are acidic. They produce a wide range of physiological responses in the plants. Their ability to cause an increase in length of axis is used to increase the length of grapes stalks. Gibberellins, cause fruits like apple to elongate and improve its shape. They also delay senescence. Thus, the fruits can be left on the tree longer so as to extend the market period. GA3 is used to speed up the malting process in brewing industry. Sugarcane stores carbohydrate as sugar in their stems. Spraying sugarcane crop with gibberellins increases the length of the stem, thus increasing the yield by as much as 20 tonnes per acre. Spraying juvenile conifers with GAs hastens the maturity period, thus leading to early seed production. Gibberellins also promotes bolting (internode elongation just prior to flowering) in beet, cabbages and many plants with rosette habit. 13.4.3.3 13.4.3.313.4.3.3 13.4.3.313.4.3.3 CytokininsCytokininsCytokininsCytokininsCytokinins Cytokinins have specific effects on cytokinesis, and were discovered as kinetin (a modified form of adenine, a purine) from the autoclaved herring sperm DNA. Kinetin does not occur naturally in plants. Search for natural substances with cytokinin-like activities led to the isolation of zeatin from corn-kernels and coconut milk. Since the discovery of zeatin, several naturally occurring cytokinins, and some synthetic compounds with cell division promoting activity, have been identified. Natural cytokinins are Figure 13.11 Apical dominance in plants : (a) A plant with apical bud intact (b) A plant with apical bud removed Note the growth of lateral buds into branches after decapitation.(a) (b) 2024-25 PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 177 synthesised in regions where rapid cell division occurs, for example, root apices, developing shoot buds, young fruits etc. It helps to produce new leaves, chloroplasts in leaves, lateral shoot growth and adventitious shoot formation. Cytokinins help overcome the apical dominance. They promote nutrient mobilisation which helps in the delay of leaf senescence. 13.4.3.413.4.3.413.4.3.413.4.3.413.4.3.4 Ethylene EthyleneEthylene EthyleneEthylene Ethylene is a simple gaseous PGR. It is synthesised in large amounts by tissues undergoing senescence and ripening fruits. Influences of ethylene on plants include horizontal growth of seedlings, swelling of the axis and apical hook formation in dicot seedlings. Ethylene promotes senescence and abscission of plant organs especially of leaves and flowers. Ethylene is highly effective in fruit ripening. It enhances the respiration rate during ripening of the fruits. This rise in rate of respiration is called respiratory climactic. Ethylene breaks seed and bud dormancy, initiates germination in peanut seeds, sprouting of potato tubers. Ethylene promotes rapid internode/petiole elongation in deep water rice plants. It helps leaves/ upper parts of the shoot to remain above water . Ethylene also pr omotes root growth and root hair formation, thus helping the plants to increase their absorption surface. Ethylene is used to initiate flowering and for synchronising fruit-set in pineapples. It also induces flowering in mango. Since ethylene regulates so many physiological processes, it is one of the most widely used PGR in agriculture. The most widely used compound as source of ethylene is ethephon. Ethephon in an aqueous solution is readily absorbed and transported within the plant and releases ethylene slowly. Ethephon hastens fruit ripening in tomatoes and apples and accelerates abscission in flowers and fruits (thinning of cotton, cherry, walnut). It promotes female flowers in cucumbers thereby increasing the yield. 13.4.3.5 13.4.3.513.4.3.5 13.4.3.513.4.3.5 Abscisic acidAbscisic acidAbscisic acidAbscisic acidAbscisic acid As mentioned earlier , abscisic acid (ABA) was discover ed for its r ole in regulating abscission and dormancy. But like other PGRs, it also has other wide ranging effects on plant growth and development. It acts as a general plant growth inhibitor and an inhibitor of plant metabolism. ABA inhibits seed germination. ABA stimulates the closure of stomata and increases the tolerance of plants to various kinds of stresses. Therefore, it is also called the stress hormone. ABA plays an important 2024-25 178 BIOLOGY role in seed development, maturation and dormancy. By inducing dormancy, ABA helps seeds to withstand desiccation and other factors unfavourable for growth. In most situations, ABA acts as an antagonist to GAs. We may summarise that for any and every phase of gr owth, differentiation and development of plants, one or the other PGR has some role to play. Such roles could be complimentary or antagonistic. These could be individualistic or synergistic. Similarly, there are a number of events in the life of a plant where more than one PGR interact to affect that event, e.g., dormancy in seeds/ buds, abscission, senescence, apical dominance, etc. Remember , the r ole of PGR is of only one kind of intrinsic control. Along with genomic control and extrinsic factors, they play an important role in plant growth and development. Many of the extrinsic factors such as temperature and light, control plant growth and development via PGR. Some of such events could be: vernalisation, flowering, dormancy, seed germination, plant movements, etc. We shall discuss briefly the r ole of light and temperatur e (both of them, the extrinsic factors) on initiation of flowering. SUMMARY Growth is one of the most conspicuous events in any living organism. It is an irreversible increase expressed in parameters such as size, area, length, height, volume, cell number etc. It conspicuously involves increased protoplasmic material. In plants, meristems are the sites of growth. Root and shoot apical meristems sometimes alongwith intercalary meristem, contribute to the elongation growth of plant axes. Growth is indeterminate in higher plants. Following cell division in root and shoot apical meristem cells, the growth could be arithmetic or geometrical. Growth may not be and generally is not sustained at a high rate throughout the life of cell/ tissue/organ/organism. One can define three principle phases of growth – the lag, the log and the senescent phase. When a cell loses the capacity to divide, it leads to differentiation. Differentiation results in development of structures that is commensurate with the function the cells finally has to perform. General principles for differentiation for cell, tissues and organs are similar . A dif ferentiated cell may dedif ferentiate and then r edifferentiate. Since differentiation in plants is open, the development could also be flexible, i.e., the development is the sum of growth and differentiation. Plant exhibit plasticity in development. 2024-25 PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 179 Plant growth and development are under the control of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intercellular intrinsic factors are the chemical substances, called plant growth regulators (PGR). There are diverse groups of PGRs in plants, principally belonging to five groups: auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and ethylene. These PGRs are synthesised in various parts of the plant; they control different differentiation and developmental events. Any PGR has diverse physiological effects on plants. Diverse PGRs also manifest similar effects. PGRs may act synergistically or antagonistically. Plant growth and development is also affected by light, temperature, nutrition, oxygen status, gravity and such external factors.

    "input": "UNIT 5The reductionist  approach to study of life forms resulted in increasinguse of physico-chemical concepts and techniques. Majority of these\nstudies employed either surviving tissue model or straightaway cell-\nfree systems. An explosion of knowledge resulted in molecular biology.\nMolecular physiology became almost synonymous with biochemistry\nand biophysics. However, it is now being increasingly realised thatneither a purely organismic approach nor a purely reductionistic\nmolecular approach would reveal the truth about biological processes\nor living phenomena. Systems biology makes us believe that all living\nphenomena are emergent properties due to interaction among\ncomponents of the system under study. Regulatory network of\nmolecules, supra molecular assemblies, cells, tissues, organisms and\nindeed, populations and communities, each create emergent\nproperties. In the chapters under this unit, major human physiological\nprocesses like, exchange of gases, blood circulation, locomotion and\nmovement are described in cellular and molecular terms. The last\ntwo chapters point to the coordination and regulation of body events\nat the organismic level.HUMAN PHYSIOLOGYChapter 14\nBreathing and Exchange\nof GasesChapter 15Body Fluids and\nCirculationChapter 16Excretory Products and\ntheir EliminationChapter 17Locomotion and MovementChapter 18Neural Control and\nCoordinationChapter 19Chemical Coordination\nand IntegrationALFONSO CORTI, Italian anatomist, was born in 1822. Corti beganhis scientific career studying the cardiovascular systems ofreptiles. Later, he turned his attention to the mammalianauditory system. In 1851, he published a paper describing a\nstructure located on the basilar membrane of the cochlea\ncontaining hair cells that convert sound vibrations into nerve\nimpulses, the organ of Corti. He died in the year 1888.Alfonso Corti(1822 – 1888)183BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASESAs you have read earlier, oxygen (O2) is utilised by the organisms toindirectly break down simple molecules like glucose, amino acids, fattyacids, etc., to derive energy to perform various activities. Carbon dioxide\n(CO2) which is harmful is also released during the above catabolicreactions. It is, therefore, evident that O2  has to be continuously providedto the cells and CO2 produced by the cells have to be released out. Thisprocess of exchange of O2 from the atmosphere with CO2 produced by thecells is called breathing, commonly known as respiration. Place yourhands on your chest; you can feel the chest moving up and down. Youknow that it is due to breathing. How do we breathe? The respiratoryorgans and the mechanism of breathing are described in the followingsections of this chapter.14.1RESPIRATORY ORGANSMechanisms of breathing vary among different groups of animalsdepending mainly on their habitats and levels of organisation. Lower\ninvertebrates like sponges, coelenterates, flatworms, etc., exchange O2with CO2 by simple diffusion over their entire body surface. Earthwormsuse their moist cuticle and insects have a network of tubes (tracheal\ntubes) to transport atmospheric air within the body. Special vascularised\nstructures called gills (branchial respiration) are used by most of theaquatic arthropods and molluscs whereas vascularised bags called lungs(pulmonary respiration) are used by the terrestrial forms for the exchange\nof gases. Among vertebrates, fishes use gills whereas amphibians, reptiles,birds and mammals respire through lungs. Amphibians like frogs canrespire through their moist skin (cutaneous respiration) also.BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASESCHAPTER  1414.1RespiratoryOrgans14.2Mechanism of\nBreathing14.3Exchange ofGases14.4Transport ofGases14.5Regulation of\nRespiration14.6Disorders ofRespiratorySystem184BIOLOGY14.1.1Human Respiratory SystemWe have a pair of external nostrils opening out above the upper lips.It leads to a nasal chamber through the nasal passage. The nasalchamber opens into the pharynx, a portion of which is the commonpassage for food and air. The pharynx opens through the larynx regioninto the trachea. Larynx is a cartilaginous box which helps in soundproduction and hence called the sound box. During swallowing glottiscan be covered by a thin elastic cartilaginous flap called epiglottis  toprevent the entry of food into the larynx. Trachea is a straight tubeextending up to the mid-thoracic cavity, which divides at the level of5th thoracic vertebra into a right and left primary bronchi. Each bronchiundergoes repeated divisions to form the secondary and tertiary bronchi\nand bronchioles ending up in very thin terminal bronchioles. Thetracheae, primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi, and initialbronchioles are supported by incomplete cartilaginous rings. Eachterminal bronchiole gives rise to a number of very thin, irregular-walledand vascularised bag-like structures called alveoli. The branchingnetwork of bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli comprise the lungs (Figure\n14.1). We have two lungs which are covered by a double layered pleura,with pleural fluid between them. It reduces friction on the lung-surface.The outer pleural membrane is in close contact with the thoracicBronchusLungheartDiaphragmEpiglottisLarynxTracheaCut end of ribPleural membranesAlveoliPleural fluidBronchioleFigure 14.1Diagrammatic view of human respiratory system (sectional view ofthe left lung is also shown)185BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASESlining whereas the inner pleural membrane is in contact with the lungsurface. The part starting with the external nostrils up to the terminalbronchioles constitute the conducting part whereas the alveoli and their\nducts form the respiratory or exchange part of the respiratory system.The conducting part transports the atmospheric air to the alveoli, clearsit from foreign particles, humidifies and also brings the air to body\ntemperature. Exchange part is the site of actual diffusion of O2 and CO2between blood and atmospheric air.The lungs are situated in the thoracic chamber which is anatomicallyan air-tight chamber. The thoracic chamber is formed dorsally by thevertebral column, ventrally by the sternum, laterally by the ribs and on\nthe lower side by the dome-shaped diaphragm. The anatomical setup of\nlungs in thorax is such that any change in the volume of the thoraciccavity will be reflected in the lung (pulmonary) cavity. Such anarrangement is essential for breathing, as we cannot directly alter the\npulmonary volume.Respiration involves the following steps:(i)Breathing or pulmonary ventilation by which atmospheric airis drawn in and CO2 rich alveolar air is released out.(ii)Diffusion of gases (O2 and CO2) across alveolar membrane.(iii)Transport of gases by the blood.(iv)Diffusion of O2 and CO2 between blood and tissues.(v)Utilisation of O2 by the cells for catabolic reactions and resultantrelease of CO2 (cellular respiration as dealt in the Chapter 12).14.2MECHANISM OF BREATHINGBreathing involves two stages : inspiration during which atmosphericair is drawn in and expiration by which the alveolar air is released out.The movement of air into and out of the lungs is carried out by creating apressure gradient between the lungs and the atmosphere. Inspirationcan occur if the pressure within the lungs (intra-pulmonary pressure) is\nless than the atmospheric pressure, i.e., there is a negative pressure inthe lungs with respect to atmospheric pressure. Similarly, expiration takesplace when the intra-pulmonary pressure is higher than the atmospheric\npressure. The diaphragm and a specialised set of muscles – external andinternal intercostals between the ribs, help in generation of such gradients.Inspiration is initiated by the contraction of diaphragm which increases\nthe volume of thoracic chamber in the antero-posterior axis. Thecontraction of external inter-costal muscles lifts up the ribs and the186BIOLOGYsternum causing an increase in the volume ofthe thoracic chamber in the  dorso-ventral axis.The overall increase in the thoracic volume\ncauses a similar increase in pulmonaryvolume. An increase in pulmonary volumedecreases the intra-pulmonary pressure to less\nthan the atmospheric pressure which forcesthe air from outside to move into the lungs,i.e., inspiration (Figure 14.2a). Relaxation of\nthe diaphragm and the inter-costal musclesreturns the diaphragm and sternum to their\nnormal positions and reduce the thoracic\nvolume and thereby the pulmonary volume.This leads to an increase in intra-pulmonarypressure to slightly above the atmospheric\npressure causing the expulsion of air from thelungs, i.e., expiration (Figure 14.2b). We havethe ability to increase the strength ofinspiration and expiration with the help ofadditional muscles in the abdomen. On anaverage, a healthy human breathes 12-16times/minute. The volume of air involved inbreathing movements can be estimated byusing a spirometer which helps in clinical\nassessment of pulmonary functions.14.2.1Respiratory Volumes andCapacitiesTidal Volume (TV): Volume of air inspired orexpired during a normal respiration. It isapprox. 500 mL., i.e., a healthy man caninspire or expire approximately 6000 to 8000mL of air per minute.Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV):Additional volume of air, a person can inspireby a forcible inspiration. This averages 2500mL to 3000 mL.Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV):Additional volume of air, a person can expireby a forcible expiration. This averages 1000mL to 1100 mL.Figure 14.2  Mechanism of breathing showing :(a) inspiration  (b) expiration187BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASESResidual Volume (RV): Volume of air remaining in the lungs even after aforcible expiration. This averages 1100 mL to 1200 mL.By adding up a few respiratory volumes described above, one canderive various pulmonary capacities, which can be used in clinicaldiagnosis.Inspiratory Capacity (IC): Total volume of air a person can inspireafter a normal expiration. This includes tidal volume and inspiratoryreserve volume (TV+IRV).Expiratory Capacity (EC): Total volume of air a person can expire aftera normal inspiration. This includes tidal volume and expiratory reserve\nvolume (TV+ERV).Functional Residual Capacity (FRC): Volume of air that will remain inthe lungs after a normal expiration. This includes ERV+RV.Vital Capacity (VC): The maximum volume of air a person can breathe inafter a forced expiration. This includes ERV, TV and IRV or the maximumvolume of air a person can breathe out after a forced inspiration.Total Lung Capacity (TLC): Total volume of air accommodated in thelungs at the end of a forced inspiration. This includes RV, ERV, TV andIRV or vital capacity + residual volume.14.3EXCHANGE OF GASESAlveoli are the primary sites of exchange of gases. Exchange of gases alsooccur between blood and tissues. O2 and CO2 are exchanged in thesesites by simple diffusion mainly based on pressure/concentration\ngradient. Solubility of the gases as well as the thickness of the membranes\ninvolved in diffusion are also some important factors that can affect therate of diffusion.Pressure contributed by an individual gas in a mixture of gases iscalled partial pressure and is represented as pO2 for oxygen and pCO2 forcarbon dioxide. Partial pressures of these two gases in the atmosphericair and the two sites of diffusion are given in Table 14.1 and in\nFigure 14.3. The data given in the table clearly indicates a concentrationgradient for oxygen from alveoli to blood and blood to tissues. Similarly,TABLE 14.1Partial Pressures (in mm Hg) of Oxygen and Carbon dioxide at DifferentParts Involved in Diffusion in Comparison to those in AtmosphereRespiratoryAtmosphericAlveoliBloodBloodTissuesGasAir(Deoxygenated)(Oxygenated)O2159104409540CO20.340454045188BIOLOGYa gradient is present for CO2 in the opposite direction, i.e., from tissues toblood and blood to alveoli. As the solubility of CO2 is 20-25 times higherthan that of O2, the amount of CO2 that can diffuse through the diffusionmembrane per unit difference in partial pressure is much higher comparedto that of O2. The diffusion membraneis made up of three major layers(Figure 14.4) namely, the thin squamousepithelium of alveoli, the endothelium ofalveolar capillaries and the basementsubstance (composed of a thin basementmembrane supporting the squamousepithelium and the basement membranesurrounding the single layer endothelialcells of capillaries)  in between them.\nHowever, its total thickness is much lessthan a millimetre. Therefore, all the factors\nin our body are favourable for diffusion of\nO2 from alveoli to tissues and that of CO2from tissues to alveoli.Figure 14.4A Diagram of a section of analveolus with a pulmonarycapillary.Figure 14.3Diagrammatic representation of exchange of gases at the alveolus andthe body tissues with blood and transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide189BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES14.4TRANSPORT OF GASESBlood is the medium of transport for O2 and CO2. About 97 per cent of O2 istransported by RBCs in the blood. The remaining 3 per cent of O2 is carriedin a dissolved state through the plasma. Nearly 20-25 per cent of CO2 istransported by RBCs whereas 70 per cent of it is carried as bicarbonate.About 7 per cent of CO2 is carried in a dissolved state through plasma.14.4.1Transport of OxygenHaemoglobin is a red coloured iron containing pigment present in theRBCs. O2 can bind with haemoglobin in a reversible manner to formoxyhaemoglobin. Each haemoglobin molecule can carry a maximum offour molecules of O2. Binding of oxygen with haemoglobin is primarilyrelated to partial pressure of O2. Partial pressure of CO2, hydrogen ionconcentration and temperature are the other factors which can interferewith this binding. A sigmoid curve is obtained when percentage saturationof haemoglobin with O2 is plotted against thepO2. This curve is called the Oxygendissociation curve (Figure 14.5) and is highly\nuseful in studying the effect of factors like\npCO2, H+ concentration, etc., on binding of O2with haemoglobin. In the alveoli, where there\nis high pO2, low pCO2, lesser H+ concentrationand lower temperature, the factors areall favourable for the formation ofoxyhaemoglobin, whereas in the tissues,\nwhere low pO2, high pCO2, high H+concentration and higher temperature exist,\nthe conditions are favourable for dissociation\nof oxygen from the oxyhaemoglobin. Thisclearly indicates that O2 gets bound tohaemoglobin in the lung surface and getsdissociated at the tissues. Every 100 ml ofoxygenated blood can deliver around 5 ml ofO2 to the tissues under normal physiologicalconditions.14.4.2   Transport of Carbon dioxideCO2 is carried by haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobin (about20-25 per cent). This binding is related to the partial pressure of CO2.pO2 is a major factor which could affect this binding. When pCO2 is highand pO2 is low as in the tissues, more binding of carbon dioxide occurswhereas, when the pCO2 is low and pO2 is high as in the alveoli, dissociation20020404060608080100100Partial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg)Percentage saturation of haemoglobin with oxygenFigure 14.5  Oxygen dissociation curve190BIOLOGYof CO2 from carbamino-haemoglobin takes place, i.e., CO2 which is boundto haemoglobin from the tissues is delivered at the alveoli. RBCs containa very high concentration of the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase and minute\nquantities of the same is present in the plasma too. This enzyme facilitatesthe following reaction in both directions.COHOHCOCarbonicanhydraseCarbonicanhydra2223+→←sseHCOH→←+−+3At the tissue site where partial pressure of CO2 is high due tocatabolism, CO2 diffuses into blood (RBCs and plasma) and forms HCO3–and H+,. At the alveolar site where pCO2 is low, the reaction proceeds inthe opposite direction leading to the formation of CO2 and H2O. Thus,CO2 trapped as bicarbonate at the tissue level and transported to thealveoli is released out as CO2 (Figure 14.4). Every 100 ml of deoxygenatedblood delivers approximately 4 ml of CO2 to the alveoli.14.5REGULATION OF RESPIRATIONHuman beings have a significant ability to maintain and moderate therespiratory rhythm to suit the demands of the body tissues. This is doneby the neural system. A specialised centre present in the medulla regionof the brain called respiratory rhythm centre is primarily responsible for\nthis regulation. Another centre present in the pons region of the braincalled pneumotaxic centre can moderate the functions of the respiratoryrhythm centre. Neural signal from this centre can reduce the duration of\ninspiration and thereby alter the respiratory rate. A chemosensitive areais situated adjacent to the rhythm centre which is highly sensitive to CO2and hydrogen ions. Increase in these substances can activate this centre,which in turn can signal the rhythm centre to make necessary adjustmentsin the respiratory process by which these substances can be eliminated.Receptors associated with aortic arch and carotid artery also can recognise\nchanges in CO2 and H+ concentration and send necessary signals to therhythm centre for remedial actions. The role of oxygen in the regulation of\nrespiratory rhythm is quite insignificant.14.6DISORDERS OF RESPIRATORY SYSTEMAsthma is a difficulty in breathing causing wheezing due to inflammationof bronchi and bronchioles.Emphysema is a chronic disorder in which alveolar walls are damageddue to which respiratory surface is decreased. One of the major causes ofthis is cigarette smoking.191BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASESSUMMARYCells utilise oxygen for metabolism and produce energy along with substanceslike carbon dioxide which is harmful. Animals have evolved different mechanisms\nfor the transport of oxygen to the cells and for the removal of carbon dioxide fromthere. We have a well developed respiratory system comprising two lungs andassociated air passages to perform this function.The first step in respiration is breathing by which atmospheric air is taken in(inspiration) and the alveolar air is released out (expiration). Exchange of O2 andCO2 between deoxygenated blood and alveoli, transport of these gases throughoutthe body by blood, exchange of O2 and CO2 between the oxygenated blood andtissues and utilisation of O2 by the cells (cellular respiration) are the other stepsinvolved.Inspiration and expiration are carried out by creating pressure gradientsbetween the atmosphere and the alveoli with the help of specialised muscles –intercostals and diaphragm. Volumes of air involved in these activities can beestimated with the help of spirometer and are of clinical significance.Exchange of O2 and CO2 at the alveoli and tissues occur by diffusion. Rate ofdiffusion is dependent on the partial pressure gradients of O2 (pO2) and CO2 (pCO2),their solubility as well as the thickness of the diffusion surface. These factors inour body facilitate diffusion of O2 from the alveoli to the deoxygenated blood aswell as from the oxygenated blood to the tissues. The factors are favourable for thediffusion of CO2 in the opposite direction, i.e., from tissues to alveoli.Oxygen is transported mainly as oxyhaemoglobin. In the alveoli where pO2 ishigher, O2 gets bound to haemoglobin which is easily dissociated at the tissueswhere pO2 is low and pCO2 and H+ concentration are high. Nearly 70 per cent ofcarbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate (HCO3–) with the help of the enzymecarbonic anhydrase. 20-25 per cent of carbon dioxide is carried by haemoglobin\nas carbamino-haemoglobin. In the tissues where pCO2 is high, it gets bound toblood whereas in the alveoli where pCO2 is low and pO2 is high, it gets removedfrom the blood.Respiratory rhythm is maintained by the respiratory centre in the medullaregion of brain. A pneumotaxic centre in the pons region of the brain and a\nchemosensitive area in the medulla can alter respiratory mechanism.Occupational Respiratory Disorders: In certain industries, especiallythose involving grinding or stone-breaking, so much dust is produced\nthat the defense mechanism of the body cannot fully cope with the\nsituation. Long exposure can give rise to inflammation leading to fibrosis(proliferation of fibrous tissues) and thus causing serious lung damage.Workers in such industries should wear protective masks.192BIOLOGYEXERCISES1.Define vital capacity.

Also, the waste or harmful substances 15.2 Lymph (Tissue produced, have to be removed continuously for healthy functioning of Fluid) tissues. It is therefore, essential to have efficient mechanisms for the 15.3 Circulatory movement of these substances to the cells and from the cells. Different Pathways groups of animals have evolved different methods for this transport. Simple organisms like sponges and coelenterates circulate water from their 15.4 Double surroundings through their body cavities to facilitate the cells to exchange Circulation these substances. More complex organisms use special fluids within their 15.5 Regulation of bodies to transport such materials. Blood is the most commonly used body Cardiac fluid by most of the higher organisms including humans for this purpose. Activity Another body fluid, lymph, also helps in the transport of certain substances. 15.6 Disorders of In this chapter, you will learn about the composition and properties of Circulatory blood and lymph (tissue fluid) and the mechanism of circulation of blood System is also explained herein. 15.1 BLOOD Blood is a special connective tissue consisting of a fluid matrix, plasma, and formed elements. 15.1.1 Plasma Plasma is a straw coloured, viscous fluid constituting nearly 55 per cent of the blood. 90-92 per cent of plasma is water and proteins contribute 6-8 per cent of it. Fibrinogen, globulins and albumins are the major proteins. 2024-25194 BIOLOGY Fibrinogens are needed for clotting or coagulation of blood. Globulins primarly are involved in defense mechanisms of the body and the albumins help in osmotic balance. Plasma also contains small amounts of minerals like Na+, Ca++, Mg++, HCO–, Cl–, etc. Glucose, amino acids, lipids, etc., are 3 also present in the plasma as they are always in transit in the body. Factors for coagulation or clotting of blood are also present in the plasma in an inactive form. Plasma without the clotting factors is called serum. 15.1.2 Formed Elements Erythrocytes, leucocytes and platelets are collectively called formed elements (Figure 15.1) and they constitute nearly 45 per cent of the blood. Erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBC) are the most abundant of all the cells in blood. A healthy adult man has, on an average, 5 millions to 5.5 millions of RBCs mm–3 of blood. RBCs are formed in the red bone marrow in the adults. RBCs are devoid of nucleus in most of the mammals and are biconcave in shape. They have a red coloured, iron containing complex protein called haemoglobin, hence the colour and name of these cells. A healthy individual has 12-16 gms of haemoglobin in every 100 ml of blood. These molecules play a significant role in transport of respiratory gases. RBCs have an average life span of 120 days after which they are destroyed in the spleen (graveyard of RBCs). Leucocytes are also known as white blood cells (WBC) as they are colourless due to the lack of haemoglobin. They are nucleated and are relatively lesser in number which averages 6000-8000 mm–3 of blood. Leucocytes are generally short lived. We have two main categories of WBCs – granulocytes and agranulocytes. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils are different types of granulocytes, while lymphocytes and monocytes are the agranulocytes. Neutrophils are the most abundant cells (60-65 per cent) of the total WBCs and basophils are the least (0.5-1 per cent) among them. Neutrophils and monocytes (6-8 per cent) are phagocytic cells which destroy foreign organisms entering the body. Basophils secrete histamine, serotonin, heparin, etc., and are involved in inflammatory reactions. Eosinophils (2-3 per cent) resist infections and are also Eosinophil Neutrophil T lymphocyte R B C Platelets Basophil Monocyte B lymphocyte Figure 15.1 Diagrammatic representation of formed elements in blood 2024-25BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 195 associated with allergic reactions. Lymphocytes (20-25 per cent) are of two major types – ‘B’ and ‘T’ forms. Both B and T lymphocytes are responsible for immune responses of the body. Platelets also called thrombocytes, are cell fragments produced from megakaryocytes (special cells in the bone marrow). Blood normally contains 1,500,00-3,500,00 platelets mm–3. Platelets can release a variety of substances most of which are involved in the coagulation or clotting of blood. A reduction in their number can lead to clotting disorders which will lead to excessive loss of blood from the body. 15.1.3 Blood Groups As you know, blood of human beings differ in certain aspects though it appears to be similar. Various types of grouping of blood has been done. Two such groupings – the ABO and Rh – are widely used all over the world. 1111155555.....11111.....33333.....11111 AAAAABBBBBOOOOO gggggrrrrrooooouuuuupppppiiiiinnnnnggggg ABO grouping is based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens (chemicals that can induce immune response) on the RBCs namely A and B. Similarly, the plasma of different individuals contain two natural antibodies (proteins produced in response to antigens). The distribution of antigens and antibodies in the four groups of blood, A, B, AB and O are given in Table 15.1. You probably know that during blood transfusion, any blood cannot be used; the blood of a donor has to be carefully matched with the blood of a recipient before any blood transfusion to avoid severe problems of clumping (destruction of RBC). The donor’s compatibility is also shown in the Table 15.1. TABLE 15.1 Blood Groups and Donor Compatibility Blood Group Antigens on Antibodies Donor’s Group RBCs in Plasma A A anti-B A, O B B anti-A B, O AB A, B nil AB, A, B, O O nil anti-A, B O From the above mentioned table it is evident that group ‘O’ blood can be donated to persons with any other blood group and hence ‘O’ group individuals are called ‘universal donors’. Persons with ‘AB’ group can accept blood from persons with AB as well as the other groups of blood. Therefore, such persons are called ‘universal recipients’. 2024-25196 BIOLOGY 1111155555.....11111.....33333.....22222 RRRRRhhhhh gggggrrrrrooooouuuuupppppiiiiinnnnnggggg Another antigen, the Rh antigen similar to one present in Rhesus monkeys (hence Rh), is also observed on the surface of RBCs of majority (nearly 80 per cent) of humans. Such individuals are called Rh positive (Rh+ve) and those in whom this antigen is absent are called Rh negative (Rh-ve). An Rh-ve person, if exposed to Rh+ve blood, will form specific antibodies against the Rh antigens. Therefore, Rh group should also be matched before transfusions. A special case of Rh incompatibility (mismatching) has been observed between the Rh-ve blood of a pregnant mother with Rh+ve blood of the foetus. Rh antigens of the foetus do not get exposed to the Rh-ve blood of the mother in the first pregnancy as the two bloods are well separated by the placenta. However, during the delivery of the first child, there is a possibility of exposure of the maternal blood to small amounts of the Rh+ve blood from the foetus. In such cases, the mother starts preparing antibodies against Rh antigen in her blood. In case of her subsequent pregnancies, the Rh antibodies from the mother (Rh-ve) can leak into the blood of the foetus (Rh+ve) and destroy the foetal RBCs. This could be fatal to the foetus or could cause severe anaemia and jaundice to the baby. This condition is called erythroblastosis foetalis. This can be avoided by administering anti-Rh antibodies to the mother immediately after the delivery of the first child. 15.1.4 Coagulation of Blood You know that when you cut your finger or hurt yourself, your wound does not continue to bleed for a long time; usually the blood stops flowing after sometime. Do you know why? Blood exhibits coagulation or clotting in response to an injury or trauma. This is a mechanism to prevent excessive loss of blood from the body. You would have observed a dark reddish brown scum formed at the site of a cut or an injury over a period of time. It is a clot or coagulam formed mainly of a network of threads called fibrins in which dead and damaged formed elements of blood are trapped. Fibrins are formed by the conversion of inactive fibrinogens in the plasma by the enzyme thrombin. Thrombins, in turn are formed from another inactive substance present in the plasma called prothrombin. An enzyme complex, thrombokinase, is required for the above reaction. This complex is formed by a series of linked enzymic reactions (cascade process) involving a number of factors present in the plasma in an inactive state. An injury or a trauma stimulates the platelets in the blood to release certain factors which activate the mechanism of coagulation. Certain factors released by the tissues at the site of injury also can initiate coagulation. Calcium ions play a very important role in clotting. 2024-25BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 197 15.2 LYMPH (TISSUE FLUID) As the blood passes through the capillaries in tissues, some water along with many small water soluble substances move out into the spaces between the cells of tissues leaving the larger proteins and most of the formed elements in the blood vessels. This fluid released out is called the interstitial fluid or tissue fluid. It has the same mineral distribution as that in plasma. Exchange of nutrients, gases, etc., between the blood and the cells always occur through this fluid. An elaborate network of vessels called the lymphatic system collects this fluid and drains it back to the major veins. The fluid present in the lymphatic system is called the lymph. Lymph is a colourless fluid containing specialised lymphocytes which are responsible for the immune responses of the body. Lymph is also an important carrier for nutrients, hormones, etc. Fats are absorbed through lymph in the lacteals present in the intestinal villi. 15.3 CIRCULATORY PATHWAYS The circulatory patterns are of two types – open or closed. Open circulatory system is present in arthropods and molluscs in which blood pumped by the heart passes through large vessels into open spaces or body cavities called sinuses. Annelids and chordates have a closed circulatory system in which the blood pumped by the heart is always circulated through a closed network of blood vessels. This pattern is considered to be more advantageous as the flow of fluid can be more precisely regulated. All vertebrates possess a muscular chambered heart. Fishes have a 2-chambered heart with an atrium and a ventricle. Amphibians and the reptiles (except crocodiles) have a 3-chambered heart with two atria and a single ventricle, whereas crocodiles, birds and mammals possess a 4-chambered heart with two atria and two ventricles. In fishes the heart pumps out deoxygenated blood which is oxygenated by the gills and supplied to the body parts from where deoxygenated blood is returned to the heart (single circulation). In amphibians and reptiles, the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the gills/lungs/skin and the right atrium gets the deoxygenated blood from other body parts. However, they get mixed up in the single ventricle which pumps out mixed blood (incomplete double circulation). In birds and mammals, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood received by the left and right atria respectively passes on to the ventricles of the same sides. The ventricles pump it out without any mixing up, i.e., two separate circulatory pathways are present in these organisms, hence, these animals have double circulation. Let us study the human circulatory system. 2024-25198 BIOLOGY 15.3.1 Human Circulatory System Human circulatory system, also called the blood vascular system consists of a muscular chambered heart, a network of closed branching blood vessels and blood, the fluid which is circulated. Heart, the mesodermally derived organ, is situated in the thoracic cavity, in between the two lungs, slightly tilted to the left. It has the size of a clenched fist. It is protected by a double walled membranous bag, pericardium, enclosing the pericardial fluid. Our heart has four chambers, two relatively small upper chambers called atria and two larger lower chambers called ventricles. A thin, muscular wall called the inter- atrial septum separates the right and the left atria, whereas a thick-walled, the inter-ventricular septum, separates the left and the right ventricles (Figure 15.2). The atrium and the ventricle of the same side are also separated by a thick fibrous tissue called the atrio-ventricular septum. However, each of these septa are provided with an opening through which the two chambers of the same side are connected. The opening between the right atrium and the right ventricle is guarded by a valve formed of three muscular flaps or cusps, the tricuspid valve, whereas a bicuspid or mitral valve guards the opening between the left atrium and the left ventricle. The openings of the right and the left ventricles into the Figure 15.2 Section of a human heart 2024-25BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 199 pulmonary artery and the aorta respectively are provided with the semilunar valves. The valves in the heart allows the flow of blood only in one direction, i.e., from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles to the pulmonary artery or aorta. These valves prevent any backward flow. The entire heart is made of cardiac muscles. The walls of ventricles are much thicker than that of the atria. A specialised cardiac musculature called the nodal tissue is also distributed in the heart (Figure 15.2). A patch of this tissue is present in the right upper corner of the right atrium called the sino-atrial node (SAN). Another mass of this tissue is seen in the lower left corner of the right atrium close to the atrio-ventricular septum called the atrio-ventricular node (AVN). A bundle of nodal fibres, atrio- ventricular bundle (AV bundle) continues from the AVN which passes through the atrio-ventricular septa to emerge on the top of the inter- ventricular septum and immediately divides into a right and left bundle. These branches give rise to minute fibres throughout the ventricular musculature of the respective sides and are called purkinje fibres. The nodal musculature has the ability to generate action potentials without any external stimuli, i.e., it is autoexcitable. However, the number of action potentials that could be generated in a minute vary at different parts of the nodal system. The SAN can generate the maximum number of action potentials, i.e., 70-75 min–1, and is responsible for initiating and maintaining the rhythmic contractile activity of the heart. Therefore, it is called the pacemaker. Our heart normally beats 70-75 times in a minute (average 72 beats min–1). 15.3.2 Cardiac Cycle How does the heart function? Let us take a look. To begin with, all the four chambers of heart are in a relaxed state, i.e., they are in joint diastole. As the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are open, blood from the pulmonary veins and vena cava flows into the left and the right ventricle respectively through the left and right atria. The semilunar valves are closed at this stage. The SAN now generates an action potential which stimulates both the atria to undergo a simultaneous contraction – the atrial systole. This increases the flow of blood into the ventricles by about 30 per cent. The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by the AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through the entire ventricular musculature. This causes the ventricular muscles to contract, (ventricular systole), the atria undergoes relaxation (diastole), coinciding with the ventricular systole. Ventricular systole increases the ventricular pressure causing the closure of tricuspid and 2024-25200 BIOLOGY bicuspid valves due to attempted backflow of blood into the atria. As the ventricular pressure increases further, the semilunar valves guarding the pulmonary artery (right side) and the aorta (left side) are forced open, allowing the blood in the ventricles to flow through these vessels into the circulatory pathways. The ventricles now relax (ventricular diastole) and the ventricular pressure falls causing the closure of semilunar valves which prevents the backflow of blood into the ventricles. As the ventricular pressure declines further, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are pushed open by the pressure in the atria exerted by the blood which was being emptied into them by the veins. The blood now once again moves freely to the ventricles. The ventricles and atria are now again in a relaxed (joint diastole) state, as earlier. Soon the SAN generates a new action potential and the events described above are repeated in that sequence and the process continues. This sequential event in the heart which is cyclically repeated is called the cardiac cycle and it consists of systole and diastole of both the atria and ventricles. As mentioned earlier, the heart beats 72 times per minute, i.e., that many cardiac cycles are performed per minute. From this it could be deduced that the duration of a cardiac cycle is 0.8 seconds. During a cardiac cycle, each ventricle pumps out approximately 70 mL of blood which is called the stroke volume. The stroke volume multiplied by the heart rate (no. of beats per min.) gives the cardiac output. Therefore, the cardiac output can be defined as the volume of blood pumped out by each ventricle per minute and averages 5000 mL or 5 litres in a healthy individual. The body has the ability to alter the stroke volume as well as the heart rate and thereby the cardiac output. For example, the cardiac output of an athlete will be much higher than that of an ordinary man. During each cardiac cycle two prominent sounds are produced which can be easily heard through a stethoscope. The first heart sound (lub) is associated with the closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves whereas the second heart sound (dub) is associated with the closure of the semilunar valves. These sounds are of clinical diagnostic significance. 15.3.3 Electrocardiograph (ECG) You are probably familiar with this scene from a typical hospital television show: A patient is hooked up to a monitoring machine that shows voltage traces on a screen and makes the sound “... pip... pip... pip..... peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee” as the patient goes into cardiac arrest. This type of machine (electro-cardiograph) is used to obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG). ECG is a graphical representation of the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle. To obtain a standard ECG (as shown in the 2024-25BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 201 Figure 15.3), a patient is connected to the machine with three electrical leads (one to each wrist and to the left ankle) that continuously monitor the heart activity. For a detailed evaluation of the heart’s function, multiple leads are attached to the chest region. Here, we will talk only about a standard ECG. Each peak in the ECG is identified with a letter from P to T that corresponds to a specific Figure 15.3 Diagrammatic presentation of a electrical activity of the heart. standard ECG The P-wave represents the electrical excitation (or depolarisation) of the atria, which leads to the contraction of both the atria. The QRS complex represents the depolarisation of the ventricles, which initiates the ventricular contraction. The contraction starts shortly after Q and marks the beginning of the systole. The T-wave represents the return of the ventricles from excited to normal state (repolarisation). The end of the T-wave marks the end of systole. Obviously, by counting the number of QRS complexes that occur in a given time period, one can determine the heart beat rate of an individual. Since the ECGs obtained from different individuals have roughly the same shape for a given lead configuration, any deviation from this shape indicates a possible abnormality or disease. Hence, it is of a great clinical significance. 15.4 DOUBLE CIRCULATION The blood flows strictly by a fixed route through Blood Vessels—the arteries and veins. Basically, each artery and vein consists of three layers: an inner lining of squamous endothelium, the tunica intima, a middle layer of smooth muscle and elastic fibres, the tunica media, and an external layer of fibrous connective tissue with collagen fibres, the tunica externa. The tunica media is comparatively thin in the veins (Figure 15.4). As mentioned earlier, the blood pumped by the right ventricle enters the pulmonary artery, whereas the left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta. The deoxygenated blood pumped into the pulmonary artery is passed on to the lungs from where the oxygenated blood is carried by the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. This pathway constitutes the pulmonary circulation. The oxygenated blood entering the aorta is carried by a network of arteries, arterioles and capillaries to the tissues from where the deoxygenated blood is collected by a system of venules, veins and vena cava and emptied into the right atrium. This is the systemic circulation (Figure 15.4). The systemic circulation provides nutrients, O and other essential substances to the tissues and takes 2 CO and other harmful substances away for elimination. A unique 2 vascular connection exists between the digestive tract and liver called 2024-25202 BIOLOGY hepatic portal system. The hepatic portal vein carries blood from intestine to the liver before it is delivered to the systemic circulation. A special coronary system of blood vessels is present in our body exclusively for the circulation of blood to and from the cardiac musculature. Figure 15.4 Schematic plan of blood circulation in human 15.5 REGULATION OF CARDIAC ACTIVITY Normal activities of the heart are regulated intrinsically, i.e., auto regulated by specialised muscles (nodal tissue), hence the heart is called myogenic. A special neural centre in the medulla oblangata can moderate the cardiac function through autonomic nervous system (ANS). Neural signals through the sympathetic nerves (part of ANS) can increase the rate of heart beat, the strength of ventricular contraction and thereby the cardiac output. On the other hand, parasympathetic neural signals (another component of ANS) decrease the rate of heart beat, speed of conduction of action potential and thereby the cardiac output. Adrenal medullary hormones can also increase the cardiac output. 15.6 DISORDERS OF CIRCULATORY SYSTEM High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): Hypertension is the term for blood pressure that is higher than normal (120/80). In this measurement 120 mm Hg (millimetres of mercury pressure) is the systolic, or pumping, pressure and 80 mm Hg is the diastolic, or resting, pressure. If repeated checks of blood pressure of an individual is 140/90 (140 over 90) or 2024-25BODY FLUIDS AND CIRCULATION 203 higher, it shows hypertension. High blood pressure leads to heart diseases and also affects vital organs like brain and kidney. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Coronary Artery Disease, often referred to as atherosclerosis, affects the vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle. It is caused by deposits of calcium, fat, cholesterol and fibrous tissues, which makes the lumen of arteries narrower. Angina: It is also called ‘angina pectoris’. A symptom of acute chest pain appears when no enough oxygen is reaching the heart muscle. Angina can occur in men and women of any age but it is more common among the middle-aged and elderly. It occurs due to conditions that affect the blood flow. Heart Failure: Heart failure means the state of heart when it is not pumping blood effectively enough to meet the needs of the body. It is sometimes called congestive heart failure because congestion of the lungs is one of the main symptoms of this disease. Heart failure is not the same as cardiac arrest (when the heart stops beating) or a heart attack (when the heart muscle is suddenly damaged by an inadequate blood supply). SUMMARY Vertebrates circulate blood, a fluid connective tissue, in their body, to transport essential substances to the cells and to carry waste substances from there. Another fluid, lymph (tissue fluid) is also used for the transport of certain substances. Blood comprises of a fluid matrix, plasma and formed elements. Red blood cells (RBCs, erythrocytes), white blood cells (WBCs, leucocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes) constitute the formed elements. Blood of humans are grouped into A, B, AB and O systems based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens, A, B on the RBCs. Another blood grouping is also done based on the presence or absence of another antigen called Rhesus factor (Rh) on the surface of RBCs. The spaces between cells in the tissues contain a fluid derived from blood called tissue fluid. This fluid called lymph is almost similar to blood except for the protein content and the formed elements. All vertebrates and a few invertebrates have a closed circulatory system. Our circulatory system consists of a muscular pumping organ, heart, a network of vessels and a fluid, blood. Heart has two atria and two ventricles. Cardiac musculature is auto-excitable. Sino-atrial node (SAN) generates the maximum number of action protentials per minute (70-75/min) and therefore, it sets the pace of the activities of the heart. Hence it is called the Pacemaker. The action potential causes the atria and then the ventricles to undergo contraction (systole) followed by their relaxation (diastole). The systole forces the blood to move from the atria to the ventricles and to the pulmonary artery and the aorta. The cardiac cycle is formed by sequential events in the heart which is cyclically repeated and is called the cardiac cycle. A healthy person shows 72 such cycles per minute. About 70 mL of blood is pumped out by each ventricle during a cardiac cycle and it is called the stroke or beat volume. Volume of blood pumped out by each ventricle of heart per minute is called the cardiac output and it is equal to the product of stroke volume and heart rate (approx 5 litres). The electrical activity of the heart can be recorded from 2024-25204 BIOLOGY the body surface by using electrocardiograph and the recording is called electrocardiogram (ECG) which is of clinical importance. We have a complete double circulation, i.e., two circulatory pathways, namely, pulmonary and systemic are present. The pulmonary circulation starts by the pumping of deoxygenated blood by the right ventricle which is carried to the lungs where it is oxygenated and returned to the left atrium. The systemic circulation starts with the pumping of oxygenated blood by the left ventricle to the aorta which is carried to all the body tissues and the deoxygenated blood from there is collected by the veins and returned to the right atrium. Though the heart is autoexcitable, its functions can be moderated by neural and hormonal mechanisms. EXERCISES 1.

These substances haveato be removed totally or partially. In this chapter, you will learn themechanisms of elimination of these substances with special emphasis oncommon nitrogenous wastes. Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the majorforms of nitrogenous wastes excreted by the animals. Ammonia is theamost toxic form and requires large amount of water for its elimination,awhereas uric acid, being the least toxic, can be removed with a minimumaloss of water.The process of excreting ammonia is Ammonotelism. Many bony fishes,aquatic amphibians and aquatic insects are ammonotelicammonotelicammonotelicammonotelicammonotelic in nature.Ammonia, as it is readily soluble, is generally excreted by diffusion acrossabody surfaces or through gill surfaces (in fish) as ammonium ions. Kidneysado not play any significant role in its removal. Terrestrial adaptationanecessitated the production of lesser toxic nitrogenous wastes like ureaaand uric acid for conservation of water. Mammals, many terrestrialamphibians and marine fishes mainly excrete urea and are called ureotelicureotelicureotelicureotelicureotelicanimals. Ammonia produced by metabolism is converted into urea in theliver of these animals and released into the blood which is filtered andaexcreted out by the kidneys. Some amount of urea may be retained in theakidney matrix of some of these animals to maintain a desired osmolarity.aReptiles, birds, land snails and insects excrete nitrogenous wastes as uricaacid in the form of pellet or paste with a minimum loss of water and arecalled uricotelicuricotelicuricotelicuricotelicuricotelic animals.EXCRETORY PRODUCTS ANDTHEIR ELIMINATIONCHAPTER  1616.1HumanExcretorySSystem16.2Urine Formation16.3Function of theSTubules16.4Mechanism ofSConcentrationSofthe Filtrate16.5Regulation ofSKidney Function16.6Micturition16.7Role of otherSOrgans inSExcretion16.8Disorders of theSExcretorySSystem2024-25206BIOLOGYA survey of animal kingdom presents a variety of excretory structures.In most of the invertebrates, these structures  are simple tubular formswhereas vertebrates have complex tubular organs called kidneys. Someof these structures are mentioned here. Protonephridia or flame cells arethe excretory structures in Platyhelminthes (Flatworms, e.g., Planaria),rotifers, some annelids and the cephalochordate – Amphioxus.Protonephridia are primarily concerned with ionic and fluid volumeregulation, i.e., osmoregulation. Nephridia are the tubular excretorystructures of earthworms and other annelids. Nephridia help to removeanitrogenous wastes and maintain a fluid and ionic balance. Malpighiantubules are the excretory structures of most of the insects includingcockroaches. Malpighian tubules help in the removal of nitrogenouswastes and osmoregulation. Antennal glands or green glands performthe excretory function in crustaceans like prawns.16.1 HUMAN EXCRETORY SYSTEMIn humans, the excretory system consistsaof a pair of kidneys, one pair of ureters, aaurinary bladder and a urethra (Figure16.1). Kidneys are reddish brown, beanshaped structures situated between thelevels of last thoracic and third lumbarvertebra close to the dorsal inner wall ofathe abdominal cavity. Each kidney of anadult human measures 10-12 cm inlength, 5-7 cm in width, 2-3 cm inthickness with an average weight of 120-170 g. Towards the centre of the innerconcave surface of the kidney is a notchcalled hilum through which ureter, bloodvessels and nerves enter. Inner to the hilumis a broad funnel shaped space called thearenal pelvis with projections called calyces.The outer layer of kidney is a toughcapsule. Inside the kidney, there are twoazones, an outer cortex and an innermedulla. The medulla is divided into a fewconical masses (medullary pyramids)projecting into the calyces (sing.: calyx).The cortex extends in between theFigure 16.1 Human Urinary system2024-25EXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION207Figure 16.3A diagrammatic representation of a nephron showing blood vessels,duct and tubulemedullary pyramids as renal columns calledColumns of Bertini (Figure 16.2).Each kidney has nearly one millioncomplex tubular structures called nephrons(Figure 16.3), which are the functional units.Each nephron has two parts – theglomerulus and the renal tubule.Glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries formed byathe afferent arteriole – a fine branch of renalartery. Blood from the glomerulus is carriedaway by an efferent arteriole.The renal tubule begins with a doublewalled cup-like structure called Bowman’scapsule, which encloses the glomerulus.Glomerulus alongwith Bowman’s capsule, iscalled the malpighian body or renalcorpuscle (Figure 16.4). The tubulecontinues further to form a highly coiledanetwork – proximal convoluted tubuleFigure 16.2Longitudinal section (Diagrammatic)of Kidney2024-25208BIOLOGY(PCT). A hairpin shaped Henle’s loop isthe next part of the tubule which has adescending and an ascending limb. Theaascending limb continues as another highlycoiled tubular region called distalconvoluted tubule (DCT). The DCTs ofmany nephrons open into a straight tubecalled collecting duct, many of whichconverge and open into the renal pelvisthrough medullary pyramids in thecalyces.The Malpighian corpuscle, PCT andDCT of the nephron are situated in thecortical region of the kidney whereas theloop of Henle dips into the medulla. Inamajority of nephrons, the loop of Henle isatoo short and extends only very little intothe medulla. Such nephrons are calledcortical nephrons. In some of the nephrons,the loop of Henle is very long and runs deep into the medulla. Theseanephrons are called juxta medullary nephrons.The efferent arteriole emerging from the glomerulus forms a finecapillary network around the renal tubule called the peritubularacapillaries. A minute vessel of this network runs parallel to the Henle’saloop forming a ‘U’ shaped vasa recta.  Vasa recta is absent or highlyreduced in cortical nephrons.16.2URINE FORMATIONUrine formation involves three main processes namely, glomerularfiltration, reabsorption and secretion, that takes place in different parts ofthe nephron.The first step in urine formation is the filtration of blood, which is carriedout by the glomerulus and is called glomerular filtration. On an average,1100-1200 ml of blood is filtered by the kidneys per minute which constituteroughly 1/5th of the blood pumped out by each ventricle of the heart in aminute. The glomerular capillary blood pressure causes filtration of bloodthrough 3 layers, i.e., the endothelium of glomerular blood vessels, theepithelium of Bowman’s capsule and a basement membrane between theseatwo layers. The epithelial cells of Bowman’s capsule called podocytes arearranged in an intricate manner so as to leave some minute spaces calledafiltration slits or slit pores. Blood is filtered so finely through theseamembranes, that almost all the constituents of the plasma except theproteins pass onto the lumen of the Bowman’s capsule. Therefore, it isconsidered as a process of ultra filtration.Afferent arterioleEfferentarterioleBowman’scapsuleProximalconvoluted\ttubuleFigure 16.4Malpighian body (renal corpuscle)2024-25EXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION209The amount of the filtrate formed by the kidneys per minute is calledglomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR in a healthy individual isapproximately 125 ml/minute, i.e., 180 litres per day !The kidneys have built-in mechanisms for the regulation of glomerularfiltration rate. One such efficient mechanism is carried out by juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA). JGA is a special sensitive region formed bycellular modifications in the distal convoluted tubule and the afferentaarteriole at the location of their contact. A fall in GFR can activate the JGacells to release renin which can stimulate the glomerular blood flow andthereby the GFR back to normal.A comparison of the volume of the filtrate formed per day (180 litresper day) with that of the urine released (1.5 litres), suggest that nearly 99per cent of the filtrate has to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. Thisprocess is called reabsorption. The tubular epithelial cells in differentsegments of nephron perform this either by active or passive mechanisms.For example, substances like glucose, amino acids, Na+, etc., in the filtrateare reabsorbed actively whereas the nitrogenous wastes are absorbed bypassive transport. Reabsorption of water also occurs passively in the initialsegments of the nephron (Figure 16.5).During urine formation, the tubular cells secrete substances like H+,K+ and ammonia into the filtrate. Tubular secretion is also an importantstep in urine formation as it helps in the maintenance of ionic and acidbase balance of body fluids.16.3FUNCTION OF THE TUBULESProximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): PCT is lined by simple cuboidalbrush border epithelium which increases the surface area for reabsorption.Nearly all of the essential nutrients, and 70-80 per cent of electrolytesand water are reabsorbed by this segment. PCT also helps to maintainathe pH and ionic balance of the body fluids by selective secretion ofahydrogen ions and ammonia into the filtrate and by absorption ofHCO3– from it.Henle’s Loop: Reabsorption is minimum in its ascending limb.However, this region plays a significant role in the maintenance of highosmolarity of medullary interstitial fluid. The descending limb of loop ofHenle is permeable to water but almost impermeable to electrolytes. Thisconcentrates the filtrate as it moves down. The ascending limb isaimpermeable to water but allows transport of electrolytes actively orapassively. Therefore, as the concentrated filtrate pass upward, it getsdiluted due to the passage of electrolytes to the medullary fluid.Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT): Conditional reabsorption of Na+and water takes place in this segment. DCT is also capable of reabsorptionof HCO3– and selective secretion of hydrogen and potassium ions andNH3 to maintain the pH and sodium-potassium balance in blood.2024-25210BIOLOGYCollecting Duct: This long duct extends from the cortex of the kidneyto the inner parts of the medulla. Large amounts of water could bereabsorbed from this region to produce a concentrated urine. This segmentallows passage of small amounts of urea into the medullary interstitiumato keep up the osmolarity. It also plays a role in the maintenance of pHaand ionic balance of blood by the selective secretion of H+ and K+ ions(Figure 16.5).16.4MECHANISM OF CONCENTRATION OF THE FILTRATEMammals have the ability to produce a concentrated urine. The Henle’saloop and vasa recta play a significant role in this. The flow of filtrate inthe two limbs of Henle’s loop is in opposite directions and thus forms aacounter current. The flow of blood through the two limbs of vasa recta isFigure 16.5Reabsorption and secretion of major substances at different parts ofthe nephron (Arrows indicate direction of movement of materials.)2024-25EXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION211also in a counter current pattern. The proximity between the Henle’s loopand vasa recta, as well as the counter current in them help in maintainingan increasing osmolarity towards the inner medullary interstitium, i.e.,from 300 mOsmolL–1 in the cortex to about 1200 mOsmolL–1 in the innermedulla. This gradient is mainly caused by NaCl and urea. NaCl isatransported by the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is exchangedawith the descending limb of vasa recta. NaCl is returned to the interstitiumby the ascending portion of vasa recta. Similarly, small amounts of ureaenter the thin segment of the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which isatransported back to the interstitium by the collecting tubule. The aboveadescribed transport of substances facilitated by the special arrangementaof Henle’s loop and vasa recta is called the counter current mechanism(Figure. 16.6). This mechanism helps to maintain a concentration gradientFigure 16.6 Diagrammatic representation of a nephron and vasa recta showingcounter current mechanisms2024-25212BIOLOGYin the medullary interstitium. Presence of such interstitial gradient helpsin an easy passage of water from the collecting tubule therebyconcentrating the filtrate (urine). Human kidneys can produce urine nearlyafour times concentrated than the initial filtrate formed.16.5REGULATION OF KIDNEY FUNCTIONThe functioning of the kidneys is efficiently monitored and regulated byahormonal feedback mechanisms involving the hypothalamus, JGA andato a certain extent, the heart.Osmoreceptors in the body are activated by changes in blood volume,body fluid volume and ionic concentration. An excessive loss of fluid fromathe body can activate these receptors which stimulate the hypothalamusto release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressinfrom theneurohypophysis. ADH facilitates water reabsorption from latter parts ofthe tubule, thereby preventing diuresis. An increase in body fluid volumecan switch off the osmoreceptors and suppress the ADH release to completethe feedback. ADH can also affect the kidney function by its constrictoryaeffects on blood vessels. This causes an increase in blood pressure. Anincrease in blood pressure can increase the glomerular blood flow andthereby the GFR.The JGA plays a complex regulatory role. A fall in glomerular bloodflow/glomerular blood pressure/GFR can activate the JG cells to release1renin which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I andafurther to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, being a powerfulvasoconstrictor, increases the glomerular blood pressure and therebyGFR. Angiotensin II also activates the adrenal cortex to releaseAldosterone. Aldosterone causes reabsorption of Na+ and water fromthe distal parts of the tubule. This also leads to an increase in bloodapressure and GFR. This complex mechanism is generally known asathe Renin-Angiotensin mechanism.An increase in blood flow to the atria of the heart can cause the releaseof Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF). ANF can cause vasodilation (dilation ofblood vessels) and thereby decrease the blood pressure. ANF mechanism,therefore, acts as a check on the renin-angiotensin mechanism.16.6MICTURITIONUrine formed by the nephrons is ultimately carried to the urinary bladderwhere it is stored till a voluntary signal is given by the central nervoussystem (CNS). This signal is initiated by the stretching of the urinary bladderas it gets filled with urine. In response, the stretch receptors on the wallsaof the bladder send signals to the CNS. The CNS passes on motor messages2024-25EXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION213to initiate the contraction of smooth muscles of the bladder andsimultaneous relaxation of the urethral sphincter causing the release ofurine. The process of release of urine is called micturition and the neuralmechanisms causing it is called the micturition reflex. An adult humanexcretes, on an average, 1 to 1.5 litres of urine per day. The urine formedis a light yellow coloured watery fluid which is slightly acidic (pH-6.0)and has a characterestic odour. On an average, 25-30 gm of urea isexcreted out per day. Various conditions can affect the characteristics ofurine. Analysis of urine helps in clinical diagnosis of many metabolicadiscorders as well as malfunctioning of the kidney. For example, presenceof glucose (Glycosuria) and ketone bodies (Ketonuria) in urine areindicative of diabetes mellitus.16.7ROLE OF OTHER ORGANS IN EXCRETIONOther than the kidneys, lungs, liver and skin also help in the eliminationof excretory wastes.Our lungs remove large amounts of CO2 (approximately 200mL/minute) and also significant quantities of water every day. Liver, the largestgland in our body, secretes bile-containing substances like bilirubin,biliverdin, cholesterol, degraded steroid hormones, vitamins and drugs.aMost of these substances ultimately pass out alongwith digestive wastes.The sweat and sebaceous glands in the skin can eliminate certainsubstances through their secretions. Sweat produced by the sweataglands is a watery fluid containing NaCl, small amounts of urea, lacticacid, etc. Though the primary function of sweat is to facilitate a coolingeffect on the body surface, it also helps in the removal of some of thewastes mentioned above. Sebaceous glands eliminate certainsubstances like sterols, hydrocarbons and waxes through sebum. Thissecretion provides a protective oily covering for the skin. Do you knowthat small amounts of nitrogenous wastes could be eliminated throughsaliva too?16.8DISORDERS OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEMMalfunctioning of kidneys can lead to accumulation of urea in blood, aacondition called uremia, which is highly harmful and may lead to kidneyfailure. In such patients, urea can be removed by a process calledhemodialysis. During the process of haemodialysis, the blood drainedfrom a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysing unit called artificialkidney. Blood drained from a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysingunit after adding an anticoagulant like heparin. The unit contains a coiledacellophane tube surrounded by a fluid (dialysing fluid) having the same2024-25214BIOLOGYSUMMARYMany nitrogen containing substances, ions, CO2, water, etc., that accumulate inthe body have to be eliminated. Nature of nitrogenous wastes formed and theirexcretion vary among animals, mainly depending on the habitat (availability ofwater). Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the major nitrogenous wastes excreted.Protonephridia, nephridia, malpighian tubules, green glands and the kidneys arethe common excretory organs in animals. They not only eliminate nitrogenous wastesabut also help in the maintenance of ionic and acid-base balance of body fluids.In humans, the excretory system consists of one pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters,a urinary bladder and a urethra. Each kidney has over a million tubular structuresacalled nephrons. Nephron is the functional unit of kidney and has two portions –glomerulus and renal tubule. Glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries formed from afferentaarterioles, fine branches of renal artery. The renal tubule starts with a double walledBowman’s capsule and is further differentiated into a proximal convoluted tubule(PCT), Henle’s loop (HL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The DCTs of manyanephrons join to a common collecting duct many of which ultimately open into therenal pelvis through the medullary pyramids. The Bowman’s capsule encloses theglomerulus to form Malpighian or renal corpuscle.Urine formation involves three main processes, i.e., filtration, reabsorption andsecretion. Filtration is a non-selective process performed by the glomerulus usingathe glomerular capillary blood pressure. About 1200 ml of blood is filtered by theaglomerulus per minute to form 125 ml of filtrate in the Bowman’s capsule percomposition as that of plasma except the nitrogenous wastes. The porouscellophane membrance of the tube allows the passage of molecules basedon concentration gradient. As nitrogenous wastes are absent in theadialysing fluid, these substances freely move out, thereby clearing theblood. The cleared blood is pumped back to the body through a veinafter adding anti-heparin to it. This method is a boon for thousands ofauremic patients all over the world.Kidney transplantation is the ultimate method in the correction ofacute renal failures (kidney failure). A functioning kidney is used intransplantation from a donor, preferably a close relative, to minimise itschances of rejection by the immune system of the host. Modern clinicalaprocedures have increased the success rate of such a complicatedatechnique.Renal calculi: Stone or insoluble mass of crystallised salts (oxalates,etc.) formed within the kidney.Glomerulonephritis: Inflammation of glomeruli of kidney.2024-25EXCRETORY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ELIMINATION215minute (GFR). JGA, a specialised portion of the nephrons, plays a significant rolein the regulation of GFR. Nearly 99 per cent reabsorption of the filtrate takes placethrough different parts of the nephrons. PCT is the major site of reabsorption andaselective secretion. HL primarily helps to maintain osmolar gradient(300 mOsmolL–1 -1200 mOsmolL–1) within the kidney interstitium. DCT andcollecting duct allow extensive reabsorption of water and certain electrolytes, whichhelp in osmoregulation: H+, K+ and NH3 could be secreted into the filtrate by thetubules to maintain the ionic balance and pH of body fluids.A counter current mechanism operates between the two limbs of the loop ofHenle and those of vasa recta (capillary parallel to Henle’s loop). The filtrate getsconcentrated as it moves down the descending limb but is diluted by the ascendingalimb. Electrolytes and urea are retained in the interstitium by this arrangement.aDCT and collecting duct concentrate the filtrate about four times, i.e., from 300mOsmolL–1 to 1200 mOsmolL–1, an excellent mechanism of conservation of water.Urine is stored in the urinary bladder till a voluntary signal from CNS carries outits release through urethra, i.e., micturition.

    "input": "LOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 217 C 17 HAPTER L M OCOMOTION AND OVEMENT 17.1 Types of Movement is one of the significant features of living beings. Animals and Movement plants exhibit a wide range of movements. Streaming of protoplasm in the unicellular organisms like Amoeba is a simple form of movement. 17.2 Muscle Movement of cilia, flagella and tentacles are shown by many organisms. 17.3 Skeletal Human beings can move limbs, jaws, eyelids, tongue, etc. Some of the System movements result in a change of place or location. Such voluntary 17.4 Joints movements are called locomotion. Walking, running, climbing, flying, swimming are all some forms of locomotory movements. Locomotory 17.5 Disorders of structures need not be different from those affecting other types of Muscular and movements. For example, in Paramoecium, cilia helps in the movement of Skeletal System food through cytopharynx and in locomotion as well. Hydra can use its tentacles for capturing its prey and also use them for locomotion. We use limbs for changes in body postures and locomotion as well. The above observations suggest that movements and locomotion cannot be studied separately. The two may be linked by stating that all locomotions are movements but all movements are not locomotions. Methods of locomotion performed by animals vary with their habitats and the demand of the situation. However, locomotion is generally for search of food, shelter, mate, suitable breeding grounds, favourable climatic conditions or to escape from enemies/predators. 17.1 TYPES OF MOVEMENT Cells of the human body exhibit three main types of movements, namely, amoeboid, ciliary and muscular. 2024-25218 BIOLOGY Some specialised cells in our body like macrophages and leucocytes in blood exhibit amoeboid movement. It is effected by pseudopodia formed by the streaming of protoplasm (as in Amoeba). Cytoskeletal elements like microfilaments are also involved in amoeboid movement. Ciliary movement occurs in most of our internal tubular organs which are lined by ciliated epithelium. The coordinated movements of cilia in the trachea help us in removing dust particles and some of the foreign substances inhaled alongwith the atmospheric air. Passage of ova through the female reproductive tract is also facilitated by the ciliary movement. Movement of our limbs, jaws, tongue, etc, require muscular movement. The contractile property of muscles are effectively used for locomotion and other movements by human beings and majority of multicellular organisms. Locomotion requires a perfect coordinated activity of muscular, skeletal and neural systems. In this chapter, you will learn about the types of muscles, their structure, mechanism of their contraction and important aspects of the skeletal system. 17.2 MUSCLE You have studied in Chapter 8 that the cilia and flagella are the outgrowths of the cell membrane. Flagellar movement helps in the swimming of spermatozoa, maintenance of water current in the canal system of sponges and in locomotion of Protozoans like Euglena. Muscle is a specialised tissue of mesodermal origin. About 40-50 per cent of the body weight of a human adult is contributed by muscles. They have special properties like excitability, contractility, extensibility and elasticity. Muscles have been classified using different criteria, namely location, appearance and nature of regulation of their activities. Based on their location, three types of muscles are identified : (i) Skeletal (ii) Visceral and (iii) Cardiac. Skeletal muscles are closely associated with the skeletal components of the body. They have a striped appearance under the microscope and hence are called striated muscles. As their activities are under the voluntary control of the nervous system, they are known as voluntary muscles too. They are primarily involved in locomotory actions and changes of body postures. Visceral muscles are located in the inner walls of hollow visceral organs of the body like the alimentary canal, reproductive tract, etc. They do not exhibit any striation and are smooth in appearance. Hence, they are called smooth muscles (nonstriated muscle). Their activities are not under the voluntary control of the nervous system and are therefore known as involuntary muscles. They assist, for example, in the transportation of food through the digestive tract and gametes through the genital tract. 2024-25LOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 219 As the name suggests, Cardiac muscles are the muscles of heart. Many cardiac muscle cells assemble in a branching pattern to form a cardiac muscle. Based on appearance, cardiac muscles are striated. They are involuntary in nature as the nervous system does not control their activities directly. Let us examine a skeletal muscle in detail to understand the structure and mechanism of contraction. Each organised skeletal muscle in our body is made of a number of muscle bundles or fascicles held together by a common collagenous connective tissue layer called fascia. Each muscle bundle contains a number of muscle fibres (Figure 17.1). Each Fascicle (muscle bundle) Muscle fibre (muscle cell) Sarcolemma Blood capillary Figure 17.1 Diagrammatic cross sectional view of a muscle showing muscle bundles and muscle fibres muscle fibre is lined by the plasma membrane called sarcolemma enclosing the sarcoplasm. Muscle fibre is a syncitium as the sarcoplasm contains many nuclei. The endoplasmic reticulum, i.e., sarcoplasmic reticulum of the muscle fibres is the store house of calcium ions. A characteristic feature of the muscle fibre is the presence of a large number of parallelly arranged filaments in the sarcoplasm called myofilaments or myofibrils. Each myofibril has alternate dark and light bands on it. A detailed study of the myofibril has established that the striated appearance is due to the distribution pattern of two important proteins – Actin and Myosin. The light bands contain actin and is called I-band or Isotropic band, whereas the dark band called ‘A’ or Anisotropic band contains 2024-25220 BIOLOGY myosin. Both the proteins are arranged as rod-like structures, parallel to each other and also to the longitudinal axis of the myofibrils. Actin filaments are thinner as compared to the myosin filaments, hence are commonly called thin and thick filaments respectively. In the centre of each ‘I’ band is an elastic fibre called ‘Z’ line which bisects it. The thin filaments are firmly attached to the ‘Z’ line. The thick filaments in the ‘A’ band are also held together in the middle of this band by a thin fibrous membrane called ‘M’ line. The ‘A’ and ‘I’ bands are arranged alternately throughout the length of the myofibrils. The portion of the myofibril between two successive ‘Z’ lines is considered as the functional unit of contraction and is called a sarcomere (Figure 17.2). In a resting state, the edges of thin filaments on either side of the thick filaments partially overlap the free ends of the thick filaments leaving the central part of the thick filaments. This central part of thick filament, not overlapped by thin filaments is called the ‘H’ zone. (a) (b) Figure 17.2 Diagrammatic representation of (a) anatomy of a muscle fibre showing a sarcomere (b) a sarcomere 2024-25LOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 221 17.2.1 Structure of Contractile Proteins Each actin (thin) filament is made of two ‘F’ (filamentous) actins helically wound to each other. Each ‘F’ actin is a polymer of monomeric ‘G’ (Globular) actins. Two filaments of another protein, tropomyosin also run close to the ‘F’ actins throughout its length. A complex protein Troponin is distributed at regular intervals on the tropomyosin. In the resting state a subunit of troponin masks the active binding sites for myosin on the actin filaments (Figure 17.3a). Each myosin (thick) filament is also a polymerised protein. Many monomeric proteins called Meromyosins (Figure 17.3b) constitute one thick filament. Each meromyosin has two important parts, a globular head with a short arm and a tail, the former being called the heavy meromyosin (HMM) and the latter, the light meromyosin (LMM). The HMM component, i.e.; the head and short arm projects outwards at regular distance and angle from each other from the surface of a polymerised myosin filament and is known as cross arm. The globular head is an active ATPase enzyme and has binding sites for ATP and active sites for actin. (a) Actin binding sites Head ATP binding sites Cross arm (b) Figure 17.3 (a) An actin (thin) filament (b) Myosin monomer (Meromyosin) 17.2.2 Mechanism of Muscle Contraction Mechanism of muscle contraction is best explained by the sliding filament theory which states that contraction of a muscle fibre takes place by the sliding of the thin filaments over the thick filaments. 2024-25222 BIOLOGY Muscle contraction is initiated by a signal sent by the central nervous system (CNS) via a motor neuron. A motor neuron alongwith the muscle fibres connected to it constitute a motor unit. The junction between a motor neuron and the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre is called the neuromuscular junction or motor-end plate. A neural signal reaching this junction releases a neurotransmitter (Acetyl choline) which generates an action potential in the sarcolemma. This spreads through the muscle fibre and causes the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase in Ca++ level leads to the binding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on actin filaments and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin. Utilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head now binds to the exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge (Figure 17.4). Figure 17.4 Stages in cross bridge formation, rotation of head and breaking of cross bridge This pulls the attached actin filaments towards the centre of ‘A’ band. The ‘Z’ line attached to these actins are also pulled inwards thereby causing a shortening of the sarcomere, i.e., contraction. It is clear from the above steps, that during shortening of the muscle, i.e., contraction, the ‘I’ bands get reduced, whereas the ‘A’ bands retain the length (Figure 17.5). The myosin, releasing the ADP and P goes back to its relaxed state. A new 1 ATP binds and the cross-bridge is broken (Figure 17.4). The ATP is again hydrolysed by the myosin head and the cycle of cross bridge formation 2024-25LOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 223 Figure 17.5 Sliding-filament theory of muscle contraction (movement of the thin filaments and the relative size of the I band and H zones) and breakage is repeated causing further sliding. The process continues till the Ca++ ions are pumped back to the sarcoplasmic cisternae resulting in the masking of actin filaments. This causes the return of ‘Z’ lines back to their original position, i.e., relaxation. The reaction time of the fibres can vary in different muscles. Repeated activation of the muscles can lead to the accumulation of lactic acid due to anaerobic breakdown of glycogen in them, causing fatigue. Muscle contains a red coloured oxygen storing pigment called myoglobin. Myoglobin content is high in some of the muscles which gives a reddish appearance. Such muscles are called the Red fibres. These muscles also contain plenty of mitochondria which can utilise the large amount of oxygen stored in them for ATP production. These muscles, therefore, can also be called aerobic muscles. On the other hand, some of the muscles possess very less quantity of myoglobin and therefore, appear pale or whitish. These are the White fibres. Number of mitochondria are also few in them, but the amount of sarcoplasmic reticulum is high. They depend on anaerobic process for energy. 2024-25224 BIOLOGY 17.3 SKELETAL SYSTEM Skeletal system consists of a framework of bones and a few cartilages. This system has a significant role in movement shown by the body. Imagine chewing food without jaw bones and walking around without the limb bones. Bone and cartilage are specialised connective tissues. The former has a very hard matrix due to calcium salts in it and the latter has slightly pliable matrix due to chondroitin salts. In human beings, this system is made up of 206 bones and a few cartilages. It is grouped into two principal divisions – the axial and the appendicular skeleton. Axial skeleton comprises 80 bones distributed along the main axis of the body. The skull, vertebral column, sternum and ribs constitute axial skeleton. The skull (Figure 17.6) is composed of two sets of bones – Frontal bone Parietal bone Sphenoid bone Ethmoid bone Lacrimal bone Nasal bone Temporal bone Zygomatic bone Occipital bone Maxilla Occipital condyle Mandible Hyoid bone Figure 17.6 Diagrammatic view of human skull cranial and facial, that totals to 22 bones. Cranial bones are 8 in number. They form the hard protective outer covering, cranium for the brain. The facial region is made up of 14 skeletal elements which form the front part of the skull. A single U-shaped bone called hyoid is present at the base of the buccal cavity and it is also included in the skull. Each middle ear contains three tiny bones – Malleus, Incus and Stapes, collectively called Ear Ossicles. The skull region articulates with the superior region of the 2024-25LOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 225 vertebral column with the help of two occipital Cervical vertebra condyles (dicondylic skull). Our vertebral column (Figure 17.7) is formed by 26 serially arranged units called vertebrae and is dorsally placed. It extends from the base of the skull and constitutes the main framework of the trunk. Each vertebra has a Thoracic vertebra central hollow portion (neural canal) through which the spinal cord passes. First vertebra is the atlas and it articulates with the occipital condyles. The vertebral column is differentiated into cervical (7), thoracic (12), lumbar (5), sacral Intervertebral Lumbar (1-fused) and coccygeal (1-fused) regions disc vertebra starting from the skull. The number of cervical vertebrae are seven in almost all mammals Sacrum including human beings. The vertebral column protects the spinal cord, supports the head and Coccyx serves as the point of attachment for the ribs and musculature of the back. Sternum is a Figure 17.7 Vertebral column (right lateral view) flat bone on the ventral midline of thorax. There are 12 pairs of ribs. Each rib is a thin flat bone connected dorsally to the vertebral column and ventrally to the sternum. It has two articulation surfaces on its dorsal end and is hence called bicephalic. First seven pairs of ribs are called true ribs. Dorsally, they are attached to the thoracic vertebrae and ventrally connected to the sternum with the help of hyaline cartilage. The 8th, 9th and 10th pairs of ribs do not articulate directly with the sternum but join the seventh rib with the help of hyaline cartilage. These are called vertebrochondral (false) ribs. Last 2 pairs (11th and 12th) of ribs are not connected ventrally and are therefore, called floating ribs. Thoracic vertebrae, ribs and sternum together form the rib cage (Figure 17.8). The bones of the limbs alongwith their girdles constitute the appendicular skeleton. Each limb is made of 30 bones. Figure 17.8 Ribs and rib cage The bones of the hand (fore limb) are 2024-25226 BIOLOGY humerus, radius and ulna, carpals (wrist bones – 8 in number), metacarpals (palm bones – 5 in number) and phalanges (digits – 14 in number) (Figure 17.9). Femur (thigh bone – the longest bone), tibia and fibula, tarsals (ankle bones – 7 in number), metatarsals (5 in number) and phalanges (digits – 14 in number) are the bones of the legs (hind limb) (Figure 17.10). A cup shaped bone called patella cover the knee ventrally (knee cap). Pectoral and Pelvic girdle bones help in the articulation of the upper and the lower limbs respectively with the axial skeleton. Each girdle is formed of two halves. Each half of pectoral girdle consists of a clavicle and a scapula (Figure 17.9). Scapula is a large triangular flat bone situated in the dorsal part of the thorax between the second and the seventh ribs. The dorsal, flat, triangular body of scapula has a slightly elevated ridge called Figure 17.9 Right pectoral girdle and upper the spine which projects as a flat, expanded arm. (frontal view) process called the acromion. The clavicle articulates with this. Below the acromion is a depression called the glenoid cavity which articulates with the head of the humerus to form the shoulder joint. Each clavicle is a long slender bone with two curvatures. This bone is commonly called the collar bone. Pelvic girdle consists of two coxal bones (Figure 17.10). Each coxal bone is formed by the fusion of three bones – ilium, ischium and pubis. At the point of fusion of the above bones is a cavity called acetabulum to which the thigh bone articulates. The two halves of the pelvic girdle meet ventrally to form the pubic symphysis containing fibrous cartilage. 17.4 JOINTS Joints are essential for all types of movements involving the bony parts of the body. Figure 17.10 Right pelvic girdle and lower limb bones (frontal view) Locomotory movements are no exception to 2024-25LOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT 227 this. Joints are points of contact between bones, or between bones and cartilages. Force generated by the muscles is used to carry out movement through joints, where the joint acts as a fulcrum. The movability at these joints vary depending on different factors. Joints have been classified into three major structural forms, namely, fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial. Fibrous joints do not allow any movement. This type of joint is shown by the flat skull bones which fuse end-to-end with the help of dense fibrous connective tissues in the form of sutures, to form the cranium. In cartilaginous joints, the bones involved are joined together with the help of cartilages. The joint between the adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column is of this pattern and it permits limited movements. Synovial joints are characterised by the presence of a fluid filled synovial cavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bones. Such an arragement allows considerable movement. These joints help in locomotion and many other movements. Ball and socket joint (between humerus and pectoral girdle), hinge joint (knee joint), pivot joint (between atlas and axis), gliding joint (between the carpals) and saddle joint (between carpal and metacarpal of thumb) are some examples. 17.5 DISORDERS OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEM Myasthenia gravis: Auto immune disorder affecting neuromuscular junction leading to fatigue, weakening and paralysis of skeletal muscle. Muscular dystrophy: Progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle mostly due to genetic disorder. Tetany: Rapid spasms (wild contractions) in muscle due to low Ca++ in body fluid. Arthritis: Inflammation of joints. Osteoporosis: Age-related disorder characterised by decreased bone mass and increased chances of fractures. Decreased levels of estrogen is a common cause. Gout: Inflammation of joints due to accumulation of uric acid crystals. SUMMARY Movement is an essential feature of all living beings. Protoplasmic streaming, ciliary movements, movements of fins, limbs, wings, etc., are some forms exhibited by animals. A voluntary movement which causes the animal to change its place, is 2024-25228 BIOLOGY called locomotion. Animals move generally in search of food, shelter, mate, breeding ground, better climate or to protect themselves. The cells of the human body exhibit amoeboid, ciliary and muscular movements. Locomotion and many other movements require coordinated muscular activities. Three types of muscles are present in our body. Skeletal muscles are attached to skeletal elements. They appear striated and are voluntary in nature. Visceral muscles, present in the inner walls of visceral organs are nonstriated and involuntary. Cardiac muscles are the muscles of the heart. They are striated, branched and involuntary. Muscles possess excitability, contractility, extensibility and elasticity. Muscle fibre is the anatomical unit of muscle. Each muscle fibre has many parallelly arranged myofibrils. Each myofibril contains many serially arranged units called sarcomere which are the functional units. Each sarcomere has a central ‘A’ band made of thick myosin filaments, and two half ‘I’ bands made of thin actin filaments on either side of it marked by ‘Z’ lines. Actin and myosin are polymerised proteins with contractility. The active sites for myosin on resting actin filament are masked by a protein-troponin. Myosin head contains ATPase and has ATP binding sites and active sites for actin. A motor neuron carries signal to the muscle fibre which generates an action potential in it. This causes the release of Ca++ from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca++ activates actin which binds to the myosin head to form a cross bridge. These cross bridges pull the actin filaments causing them to slide over the myosin filaments and thereby causing contraction. Ca++ are then returned to sarcoplasmic reticulum which inactivate the actin. Cross bridges are broken and the muscles relax. Repeated stimulation of muscles leads to fatigue. Muscles are classified as Red and White fibres based primarily on the amount of red coloured myoglobin pigment in them. Bones and cartilages constitute our skeletal system. The skeletal system is divisible into axial and appendicular. Skull, vertebral column, ribs and sternum constitute the axial skeleton. Limb bones and girdles form the appendicular skeleton. Three types of joints are formed between bones or between bone and cartilage – fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial. Synovial joints allow considerable movements and therefore, play a significant role in locomotion. EXERCISES 1. Draw the diagram of a sarcomere of skeletal muscle showing different regions. 2.

    "input": "230BIOLOGYAs you know, the functions of the organs/organ systems in our bodymust be coordinated to maintain homeostasis. Coordination is theprocess through which two or more organs interact and complement theifunctions of one another. For example, when we do physical exercises,the energy demand is increased for maintaining an increased muscularactivity. The supply of oxygen is also increased. The increased supply ofoxygen necessitates an increase in the rate of respiration, heart beat andincreased blood flow via blood vessels. When physical exercise is stopped,the activities of nerves, lungs, heart and kidney gradually return to theirnormal conditions. Thus, the functions of muscles, lungs, heart, bloodvessels, kidney and other organs are coordinated while performing physicaliexercises. In our body the neural system and the endocrine system jointlycoordinate and integrate all the activities of the organs so that they functionin a synchronised fashion.The neural system provides an organised network of point-to-pointconnections for a quick coordination. The endocrine system providesichemical integration through hormones. In this chapter, you will learnabout the neural system of human, mechanisms of neural coordinationilike transmission of nerve impulse, impulse conduction across a synapse.NEURAL CONTROL ANDCOORDINATIONCHAPTER  1818.1Neural System18.2Human NeuralSystem18.3Neuron asStructural andFunctional Unitof NeuraldSystem18.4  Central NeuralSystem2024-25NEURAL CONTROLAND COORDINATION23118.1NEURAL SYSTEMThe neural system of all animals is composed of highly specialised cells calledneurons which can detect, receive and transmit different kinds of stimuli.The neural organisation is very simple in lower invertebrates. Forexample, in Hydra it is composed of a network of neurons. The neuralsystem is better organised in insects, where a brain is present along witha number of ganglia and neural tissues. The vertebrates have a moreideveloped neural system.18.2HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEMThe human neural system is divided into two parts :(i)the central neural system (CNS)(ii)the peripheral neural system (PNS)The CNS includes the brain and the spinal cord and is the site ofinformation processing and control. The PNS comprises of all the nervesiof the body associated with the CNS (brain and spinal cord). The nerveifibres of the PNS are of two types :(a) afferent fibres(b) efferent fibresThe afferent nerve fibres transmit impulses from tissues/organs tothe CNS and the efferent fibres transmit regulatory impulses from theCNS to the concerned peripheral tissues/organs.The PNS is divided into two divisions called somatic neural systemand autonomic neural system. The somatic neural system relaysimpulses from the CNS to skeletal muscles while the autonomic neuralisystem transmits impulses from the CNS to the involuntary organs andsmooth muscles of the body. The autonomic neural system is furtherclassified into sympathetic neural system and parasympathetic neuralsystem.       Visceral nervous system is the part of the peripheral nervous systemthat comprises the whole complex of nerves, fibres, ganglia, and plexusesiby which impulses travel from the central nervous system to the visceraiand from the viscera to the central nervous system.18.3NEURON AS STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL UNITOFNEURAL SYSTEMA neuron is a microscopic structure composed of three major parts, namely,Icell body, dendrites and axon (Figure 18.1). The cell body contains cytoplasmwith typical cell organelles and certain granular bodies called Nissl’s granules.Short fibres which branch repeatedly and project out of the cell body also2024-25232BIOLOGYcontain Nissl’s granules and are called dendrites. Thesefibres transmit impulses towards the cell body.   Theaxon is a long fibre, the distal end of which is branched.iEach branch terminates as a bulb-like structure calledsynaptic knob which possess synaptic vesiclescontaining chemicals called neurotransmitters. Theaxons transmit nerve impulses away from the cell bodyito a synapse or to a neuro-muscular junction. Basedon the number of axon and dendrites, the neurons areidivided into three types, i.e., multipolar (with one axonand two or more dendrites; found in the cerebral cortex),Ibipolar (with one axon and one dendrite, found in theretina of eye) and unipolar (cell body with one axononly; found usually in the embryonic stage). There areitwo types of axons, namely, myelinated and non-myelinated. The myelinated nerve fibres are envelopedwith Schwann cells, which form a myelin sheatharound the axon. The gaps between two adjacentimyelin sheaths are called nodes of Ranvier.Myelinated nerve fibres are found in spinal and cranialinerves. Unmyelinated nerve fibre is enclosed by aiSchwann cell that does not form a myelin sheatharound the axon, and is commonly found inautonomous and the somatic neural systems.18.3.1Generation and Conduction ofNerve ImpulseNeurons are excitable cells because their membranes are in a polarisedstate. Do you know why the membrane of a neuron is polarised? Differenttypes of ion channels are present on the neural membrane. These ionchannels are selectively permeable to different ions. When a neuron is notconducting any impulse, i.e., resting, the axonal membrane iscomparatively more permeable to potassium ions (K+) and nearlyimpermeable to sodium ions (Na+). Similarly, the membrane isimpermeable to negatively charged proteins present in the axoplasm.iConsequently, the axoplasm inside the axon contains high concentrationiof K+ and negatively charged proteins and low concentration of Na+. Incontrast, the fluid outside the axon contains a low concentration of K+, ahigh concentration of Na+ and thus form a concentration gradient. Theseionic gradients across the resting membrane are maintained by the activetransport of ions by the sodium-potassium pump which transports 3Na+ outwards for 2 K+ into the cell. As a result, the outer surface of theaxonal membrane possesses a positive charge while its inner surfaceFigure 18.1 Structure of a neuron2024-25NEURAL CONTROLAND COORDINATION233becomes negatively charged and therefore is polarised. The electricalpotential difference across the resting plasma membrane is called as theresting potential.You might be curious to know about the mechanisms of generationof nerve impulse and its conduction along an axon. When a stimulus isiapplied at a site (Figure 18.2 e.g., point A) on the polarised membrane,the membrane at the site A becomes freely permeable to Na+. This leadsto a rapid influx of Na+ followed by the reversal of the polarity at that site,i.e., the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged andithe inner side becomes positively charged. The polarity of the membraneiat the site A is thus reversed and hence depolarised. The electrical potentialdifference across the plasma membrane at the site A is called theaction potential, which is in fact termed as a nerve impulse. At sitesimmediately ahead, the axon (e.g., site B) membrane has a positive chargeon the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface. As aresult, a current flows on the inner surface from site A to site B. On theiouter surface current flows from site B to site A (Figure 18.2) to completethe circuit of current flow. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed, andan action potential is generated at site B.  Thus, the impulse (actionpotential) generated at site A arrives at site B. The sequence is repeatedalong the length of the axon and consequently the impulse is conducted.The rise in the stimulus-induced permeability to Na+ is extremely short-lived. It is quickly followed by a rise in permeability to K+. Within a fractionof a second, K+ diffuses outside the membrane and restores the restingpotential of the membrane at the site of excitation and the fibre becomesionce more responsive to further stimulation.--------------------++++++++++++++++++++++++----------------------++++++++++++++++++++++++--ANaBNaFigure 18.2Diagrammatic representation of impulse conduction through an axon(at points A and B)2024-25234BIOLOGY18.3.2Transmission of ImpulsesA nerve impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another throughjunctions called synapses. A synapse is formed by the membranes of apre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron, which may or may notbe separated by a gap called synaptic cleft. There are two types ofsynapses, namely, electrical synapses and chemical synapses. At electricalisynapses, the membranes of pre- and post-synaptic neurons are in veryiclose proximity. Electrical current can flow directly from one neuron intothe other across these synapses. Transmission of an impulse acrosselectrical synapses is very similar to impulse conduction along a singleaxon. Impulse transmission across an electrical synapse is always fasterthan that across a chemical synapse. Electrical synapses are rare in oursystem.At a chemical synapse, the membranes of the pre- and post-synapticneurons are separated by a fluid-filled space called synaptic clefti(Figure 18.3). Do you know how the pre-synaptic neuron transmits animpulse (action potential) across the synaptic cleft to the post-synapticneuron? Chemicals called neurotransmitters are involved in thetransmission of impulses at these synapses. The axon terminals containvesicles filled with these neurotransmitters. When an impulse (actionpotential) arrives at the axon terminal, it stimulates the movement of thesynaptic vesicles towards the membrane where they fuse with the plasmaFigure 18.3 Diagram showing axon terminal and synapse2024-25NEURAL CONTROLAND COORDINATION235membrane and release their neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. Thereleased neurotransmitters bind to their specific receptors, present onthe post-synaptic membrane. This binding opens ion channels allowingthe entry of ions which can generate a new potential in the post-synapticneuron. The new potential developed may be either excitatory orinhibitory.18.4CENTRAL NEURAL SYSTEMThe brain is the central information processing organ of our body, andacts as the ‘command and control system’. It controls the voluntarymovements, balance of the body, functioning of vital involuntary organsi(e.g., lungs, heart, kidneys, etc.), thermoregulation, hunger and thirst,circadian (24-hour) rhythms of our body, activities of several endocrineglands and human behaviour.  It is also the site for processing of vision,ihearing, speech, memory, intelligence, emotions and thoughts.The human brain is well protected by the skull. Inside the skull, thebrain is covered by cranial meninges consisting of an outer layer calleddura mater, a very thin middle layer called arachnoid and an inner layer(which is in contact with the brain tissue) called pia mater. The brain canbe divided into three major parts: (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain, and(iii) hindbrain (Figure 18.4).Figure 18.4 Diagram showing sagital section of the human brainForebrain2024-25236BIOLOGY18.4.1ForebrainThe forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and hypothalamus(Figure 18.4). Cerebrum forms the major part of the human brain. A deepcleft divides the cerebrum longitudinally into two halves, which are termedias the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The hemispheres areconnected by a tract of nerve fibres called corpus callosum. The layer ofcells which covers the cerebral hemisphere is called cerebral cortex and isithrown into prominent folds. The cerebral cortex is referred to as the greyimatter due to its greyish appearance. The neuron cell bodies areiconcentrated here giving the colour. The cerebral cortex contains motorareas, sensory areas and large regions that are neither clearly sensoryinor motor in function. These regions called as the association areas areresponsible for complex functions like intersensory associations, memoryiand communication. Fibres of the tracts are covered with the myelin sheath,iwhich constitute the inner part of cerebral hemisphere. They give aniopaque white appearance to the layer and, hence, is called the white matter.The cerebrum wraps around a structure called thalamus, which is a majoricoordinating centre for sensory and motor signaling. Another veryiimportant part of the brain called hypothalamus lies at the base of thethalamus. The hypothalamus contains a number of centres which controlibody temperature, urge for eating and drinking. It also contains severaligroups of neurosecretory cells, which secrete hormones calledihypothalamic hormones. The inner parts of cerebral hemispheres and aigroup of associated deep structures like amygdala, hippocampus, etc.,iform a complex structure called the limbic lobe or limbic system. Alongiwith the hypothalamus, it is involved in the regulation of sexual behaviour,expression of emotional reactions (e.g., excitement, pleasure, rage andfear), and motivation.18.4.2MidbrainThe midbrain is located between the thalamus/hypothalamus of theiforebrain and pons of the hindbrain. A canal called the cerebral aqueductpassess through the midbrain. The dorsal portion of the midbrain consistsimainly of four round swellings (lobes) called corpora quadrigemina.18.4.3HindbrainThe hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla (also calledthe medulla oblongata). Pons consists of fibre tracts that interconnectdifferent regions of the brain. Cerebellum has very convoluted surface inorder to provide the additional space for many more neurons. The medullaiof the brain is connected to the spinal cord. The medulla contains centreswhich control respiration, cardiovascular reflexes and gastric secretions.Three major regions make up the brain stem; mid brain, ponsand medulla oblongata. Brain stem forms the connections betweenthe brain and spinal cord.2024-25NEURAL CONTROLAND COORDINATION237SUMMARYThe neural system coordinates and integrates functions as well as metabolicand homeostatic activities of all the organs. Neurons, the functional units ofneural system are excitable cells due to a differential concentration gradient ofions across the membrane. The electrical potential difference across the restingineural membrane is called the ‘resting potential’. The nerve impulse is conductedalong the axon membrane in the form of a wave of depolarisation andrepolarisation. A synapse is formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuronand a post-synaptic neuron which may or may not be separated by a gap calledsynaptic cleft. Chemicals involved in the transmission of impulses at chemicalisynapses are called neurotransmitters.Human neural system consists of two parts : (i) central neural system (CNS)and (ii) the peripheral neural system. The CNS consists of the brain and spiralcord. The brain can be divided into three major parts : (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrainand (iii) hindbrain. The forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus andhypothalamus. The cerebrum is longitudinally divided into two halves that areconnected by the corpus callosum. A very important part of the forebrain calledihypothalamus controls the body temperature, eating and drinking. Inner partsof cerebral hemispheres and a group of associated deep structures form a complexistructure called limbic system which is concerned with olfaction, autonomicresponses, regulation of sexual behaviour, expression of emotional reactions,and motivation. The midbrain receives and integrates visual, tactile and auditoryinputs. The hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla. The cerebellumintegrates information received from the semicircular canals of the ear and theauditory system. The medulla contains centres, which control respiration,cardiovascular reflexes, and gastric secretions. Pons consist of fibre tracts thatinterconnect different regions of the brain.EXERCISES1.Briefly describe the structure of the Brain2.Compare the following:(a) Central neural system (CNS) and Peripheral neural system (PNS)(b) Resting potential and action potential3.Explain the following processes:(a) Polarisation of the membrane of a nerve fibre(b) Depolarisation of the membrane of a nerve fibre(c) Transmission of a nerve impulse across a chemical synapse2024-25238BIOLOGY4.Draw labelled diagrams of the following:(a) Neuron       (b) Brain5.Write short notes on the following:(a) Neural coordination(b) Forebrain(c) Midbrain(d) Hindbrain(e) Synapse6.Give a brief account of Mechanism of synaptic transmission.7.Explain the role of Na+ in the generation of action potential.8.Differentiate between:i(a) Myelinated and non-myelinated axons(b) Dendrites and axons(c) Thalamus and Hypothalamus(d) Cerebrum and Cerebellum9.Answer the following:(a) Which part of the human brain is the most developed?i(b)  Which part of our central neural system acts as a master clock?10.Distinguish between:(a) afferent neurons and efferent neurons(b) impulse conduction in a myelinated nerve fibre and unmyelinated nerveifibre(f) cranial nerves and spinal nerves.2024-25",

    "input": "239239CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATIONYou have already learnt that the neural system provides apoint-to-point rapid coordination among organs. The neuralcoordination is fast but short-lived. As the nerve fibres do not innervateall cells of the body and the cellular functions need to be continuouslylregulated; a special kind of coordination and integration has to beprovided. This function is carried out by hormones. The neural systemland the endocrine system jointly coordinate and regulate thelphysiological functions in the body.19.1ENDOCRINE GLANDS AND HORMONESEndocrine glands lack ducts and are hence, called ductless glands. Theirlsecretions are called hormones. The classical definition of hormone as alchemical produced by endocrine glands and released into the blood andtransported to a distantly located target organ has current scientificdefinition as follows: Hormones are non-nutrient chemicals whichact as intercellular messengers and are produced in trace amounts.The new definition covers a number of new molecules in addition to thehormones secreted by the organised endocrine glands. Invertebrateslpossess very simple endocrine systems with few hormones whereas a largenumber of chemicals act as hormones and provide coordination in thevertebrates. The human endocrine system is described here.CHEMICAL COORDINATIONAND INTEGRATIONCHAPTER  1919.1EndocrineGlands andHormones19.2HumanEndocrineSystem19.3Hormones ofHeart, KidneyandGastrointestinalyTract19.4Mechanism ofyHormone Action2024-25BIOLOGY24019.2   HUMAN ENDOCRINE SYSTEMThe endocrine glands and hormoneproducing diffused tissues/cells located indifferent parts of our body constitute theendocrine system. Pituitary, pineal,lthyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid,thymus and gonads (testis in males andovary in females) are the organisedendocrine bodies in our body(Figure 19.1). In addition to these, somelother organs, e.g., gastrointestinal tract,liver, kidney, heart also produce hormones.A brief account of the structure andlfunctions of all major endocrine glandsand hypothalamus of the human body isgiven in the following sections.19.2.1The HypothalamusAs you know, the hypothalamus is thelbasal part of diencephalon, forebrain(Figure 19.1) and it regulates a widelspectrum of body functions. It containsseveral groups of neurosecretory cellscalled nuclei which produce hormones.lThese hormones regulate the synthesisand secretion of pituitary hormones.However, the hormones produced byhypothalamus are of two types, thereleasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) andlthe inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones).lFor example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasinghormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release ofgonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamuslinhibits the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. These hormonesoriginating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass through axons and arereleased from their nerve endings. These hormones reach the pituitarylgland through a portal circulatory system and regulate the functions ofthe anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under the direct neuralregulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 19.2).Figure 19.1 Location of endocrine glandsTestis(in male)Ovaryh(in female)AdrenalPancreasThyroid andhParathyroidThymusPinealPituitaryHypothalamus2024-25241241CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION19.2.2The Pituitary GlandThe pituitary gland is located in a bony cavitycalled sella tursica and is attached tohypothalamus by a stalk (Figure 19.2). It isldivided anatomically into an adenohypophysisand a neurohypophysis. Adenohypophysisconsists of two portions, pars distalis and parslintermedia. The pars distalis region of pituitary,lcommonly called anterior pituitary, producesmgrowth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH),madrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH),luteinizing hormone (LH) and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH). Pars intermediasecretes only one hormone called melanocytestimulating hormone (MSH). However, inhumans, the pars intermedia is almost mergedlwith pars distalis. Neurohypophysis (parsnervosa) also known as posterior pituitary, storesand releases two hormones called oxytocin andvasopressin, which are actually synthesised bythe hypothalamus and are transported axonally to neurohypophysis.Over-secretion of GH stimulates abnormal growth of the body leadingto gigantism and low secretion of GH results in stunted growth resultinglin pituitary dwarfism. Excess secretion of growth hormone in adultsespecially in middle age can result in severe disfigurement (especially ofthe face) called Acromegaly, which may lead to serious complications,and premature death if unchecked. The disease is hard to diagnose inthe early stages and often goes undetected for many years, until changesin external features become noticeable. Prolactin regulates the growth ofthe mammary glands and formation of milk in them. TSH stimulates thesynthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. ACTHstimulates the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones calledglucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. LH and FSH stimulate gonadalactivity and hence are called gonadotrophins. In males, LH stimulatesthe synthesis and secretion of hormones called androgens from testis.In males, FSH and androgens regulate spermatogenesis. In females, LHinduces ovulation of fully mature follicles (graafian follicles) and maintainsthe corpus luteum, formed from the remnants of the graafian folliclesafter ovulation. FSH stimulates growth and development of the ovarianPosteriorpituitaryAnteriorpituitaryHypothalamusHypothalamicneuronsPortal circulationFigure 19.2Diagrammatic representation ofpituitary and its relationship withhypothalamus2024-25BIOLOGY242follicles in females. MSH acts on the melanocytes(melanin containing cells) and regulates pigmentationof the skin. Oxytocin acts on the smooth muscles ofour body and stimulates their contraction. In females,it stimulates a vigorous contraction of uterus at thetime of child birth, and milk ejection from the mammarygland. Vasopressin acts mainly at the kidney andstimulates resorption of water and electrolytes by theldistal tubules and thereby reduces loss of waterthrough urine (diuresis). Hence, it is also called as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH).An impairment affecting synthesis or release of ADHresults in a diminished ability of the kidney to conservewater leading to water loss and dehydration. Thiscondition is known as Diabetes Insipidus.19.2.3The Pineal GlandThe pineal gland is located on the dorsal side offorebrain. Pineal secretes a hormone called melatonin.Melatonin plays a very important role in the regulationof a 24-hour (diurnal) rhythm of our body. Forexample, it helps in maintaining the normal rhythmsof sleep-wake cycle, body temperature. In addition,lmelatonin also influences metabolism, pigmentation,the menstrual cycle as well as our defense capability.19.2.4Thyroid GlandThe thyroid gland is composed of two lobes which arelocated on either side of the trachea (Figure 19.3 a). Boththe lobes are interconnected with a thin flap of connectiveltissue called isthmus. The thyroid gland is composed offollicles and stromal tissues. Each thyroid follicle iscomposed of follicular cells, enclosing a cavity. Thesefollicular cells synthesise two hormones,tetraiodothyronine or thyroxine (T4) andtriiodothyronine (T3). Iodine is essential for the normalrate of hormone synthesis in the thyroid. Deficiency ofliodine in our diet results in hypothyroidism andenlargement of the thyroid gland, commonly calledmgoitre. Hypothyroidism during pregnancy causesdefective development and maturation of the growinglbaby leading to stunted growth (cretinism), mentalFigure 19.3Diagrammatic view of theposition of Thyroid andParathyroid(a) Ventral side(b) Dorsal side2024-25243243CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATIONretardation, low intelligence quotient, abnormal skin, deaf-mutism, etc. Inadult women, hypothyroidism may cause menstrual cycle to becomeirregular. Due to cancer of the thyroid gland or due to development ofnodules of the thyroid glands, the rate of synthesis and secretion of thethyroid hormones is increased to abnormal high levels leading to a conditioncalled hyperthyroidism which adversely affects the body physiology.Exopthalmic goitre is a form of hyperthyroidism, characterised byenlargement of the thyroid gland, protrusion of the eyeballs, increasedbasal metabolic rate, and weight loss, also called Graves’ disease.Thyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basalmetabolic rate. These hormones also support the process of red blood celllformation. Thyroid hormones control the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteinsand fats. Maintenance of water and electrolyte balance is also influenced bythyroid hormones. Thyroid gland also secretes a protein hormone calledthyrocalcitonin (TCT) which regulates the blood calcium levels.19.2.5Parathyroid GlandIn humans, four parathyroid glands are present on the back side of thelthyroid gland, one pair each in the two lobes of the thyroid gland (Figure19.3 b). The parathyroid glands secrete a peptide hormone calledmparathyroid hormone (PTH). The secretion of PTH is regulated by thecirculating levels of calcium ions.Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases the Ca2+ levels in the blood. PTHacts on bones and stimulates the process of bone resorption (dissolution/demineralisation). PTH also stimulates reabsorption of Ca2+ by the renaltubules and increases Ca2+ absorption from the digested food. It is, thus,clear that PTH is a hypercalcemic hormone, i.e., it increases the bloodlCa2+ levels. Along with TCT, it plays a significant role in calcium balancein the body.19.2.6ThymusThe thymus gland is a lobular structure located between lungs behindsternum on the ventral side of aorta. The thymus plays a major role inlthe development of the immune system. This gland secretes the peptidehormones called thymosins. Thymosins play a major role in thedifferentiation of T-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediatedimmunity. In addition, thymosins also promote production of antibodiesto provide humoral immunity. Thymus is degenerated in old individualsresulting in a decreased production of thymosins. As a result, the immuneresponses of old persons become weak.2024-25BIOLOGY244The adrenal medulla secretes two hormones called adrenaline orepinephrine and noradrenaline or norepinephrine. These arecommonly called as catecholamines. Adrenaline and noradrenaline arerapidly secreted in response to stress of any kind and during emergencysituations and are called emergency hormones or hormones of Fightor Flight. These hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation,piloerection (raising of hairs), sweating etc. Both the hormones increasethe heart beat, the strength of heart contraction and the rate of respiration.Catecholamines also stimulate the breakdown of glycogen resulting in19.2.7Adrenal GlandOur body has one pair of adrenal glands, one at the anterior part of eachkidney (Figure 19.4 a). The gland is composed of two types of tissues.The centrally located tissue is called the adrenal medulla, and outsidethis lies the adrenal cortex (Figure 19.4 b).Underproduction of hormones by the adrenal cortex alterscarbohydrate metabolism causing acute weakness and fatigue leadinglto a disease called Addison’s disease.Figure 19.4  Diagrammatic representation of : (a) Adrenal gland above kidney (b) Sectionshowing two parts of adrenal glandAdrenal glandAdrenal cortexKidneyAdrenal medulla(a)(b)2024-25245245CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATIONan increased concentration of glucose in blood. In addition, they alsostimulate the breakdown of lipids and proteins.The adrenal cortex can be divided into three layers, called zonareticularis (inner layer), zona fasciculata (middle layer) and zonaglomerulosa (outer layer). The adrenal cortex secretes many hormones,commonly called as corticoids. The corticoids, which are involved incarbohydrate metabolism are called glucocorticoids. In our body, cortisolis the main glucocorticoid. Corticoids, which regulate the balance of waterand electrolytes in our body are called mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone isthe main mineralocorticoid in our body.Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and proteolysis;and inhibit cellular uptake and utilisation of amino acids. Cortisol is alsolinvolved in maintaining the cardio-vascular system as well as the kidneyfunctions. Glucocorticoids, particularly cortisol, produces anti-inflammatory reactions and suppresses the immune response. Cortisolstimulates the RBC production. Aldosterone acts mainly at the renaltubules and stimulates the reabsorption of Na+ and water and excretionof K+ and phosphate ions. Thus, aldosterone helps in the maintenance ofelectrolytes, body fluid volume, osmotic pressure and blood pressure.lSmall amounts of androgenic steroids are also secreted by the adrenalcortex which play a role in the growth of axial hair, pubic hair and facialhair during puberty.19.2.8PancreasPancreas is a composite gland (Figure 19.1) which acts as both exocrineand endocrine gland. The endocrine pancreas consists of ‘Islets oflLangerhans’. There are about 1 to 2 million Islets of Langerhans in anormal human pancreas representing only 1 to 2 per cent of the pancreatictissue. The two main types of cells in the Islet of Langerhans are calledααααα-cells and ββ\nβββ-cells. The α-cells secrete a hormone called glucagon, whilethe ββ\nβββ-cells secrete insulin.Glucagon is a peptide hormone, and plays an important role inmaintaining the normal blood glucose levels. Glucagon acts mainly onthe liver cells (hepatocytes) and stimulates glycogenolysis resulting in anincreased blood sugar (hyperglycemia). In addition, this hormonestimulates the process of gluconeogenesis which also contributes tolhyperglycemia. Glucagon reduces the cellular glucose uptake andutilisation. Thus, glucagon is a hyperglycemic hormone.Insulin is a peptide hormone, which plays a major role in theregulation of glucose homeostasis. Insulin acts mainly on hepatocytesland adipocytes (cells of adipose tissue), and enhances cellular glucose2024-25BIOLOGY246uptake and utilisation. As a result, there is a rapid movement of glucosefrom blood to hepatocytes and adipocytes resulting in decreased bloodglucose levels (hypoglycemia). Insulin also stimulates conversion ofglucose to glycogen (glycogenesis) in the target cells. The glucosehomeostasis in blood is thus maintained jointly by the two – insulin andlglucagons.Prolonged hyperglycemia leads to a complex disorder called diabetesmellitus which is associated with loss of glucose through urine andformation of harmful compounds known as ketone bodies. Diabeticpatients are successfully treated with insulin therapy.19.2.9TestisA pair of testis is present in the scrotal sac (outside abdomen) of maleindividuals (Figure 19.1). Testis performs dual functions as a primarysex organ as well as an endocrine gland. Testis is composed ofseminiferous tubules and stromal or interstitial tissue. The Leydigcells or interstitial cells, which are present in the intertubularspaces produce a group of hormones called androgens mainlytestosterone.Androgens regulate the development, maturation and functions ofthe male accessory sex organs like epididymis, vas deferens, seminalvesicles, prostate gland, urethra etc. These hormones stimulate muscularlgrowth, growth of facial and axillary hair, aggressiveness, low pitch ofvoice etc. Androgens play a major stimulatory role in the process oflspermatogenesis (formation of spermatozoa). Androgens act on the centrallneural system and influence the male sexual behaviour (libido). Theselhormones produce anabolic (synthetic) effects on protein and carbohydratemetabolism.19.2.10OvaryFemales have a pair of ovaries located in the abdomen (Figure 19.1). Ovaryis the primary female sex organ which produces one ovum during eachlmenstrual cycle. In addition, ovary also produces two groups of steroidhormones called estrogen and progesterone. Ovary is composed ofovarian follicles and stromal tissues. The estrogen is synthesised andsecreted mainly by the growing ovarian follicles. After ovulation, thelruptured follicle is converted to a structure called corpus luteum, whichsecretes mainly progesterone.Estrogens produce wide ranging actions such as stimulation of growthand activities of female secondary sex organs, development of growing2024-25247247CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATIONovarian follicles, appearance of female secondary sex characters (e.g., highpitch of voice, etc.), mammary gland development. Estrogens also regulatelfemale sexual behaviour.Progesterone supports pregnancy. Progesterone also acts on themammary glands and stimulates the formation of alveoli (sac-likelstructures which store milk) and milk secretion.19.3HORMONES OF HEART, KIDNEY AND GASTROINTESTINAL TRACTNow you know about the endocrine glands and their hormones. However,as mentioned earlier, hormones are also secreted by some tissues whichare not endocrine glands. For example, the atrial wall of our heart secretesla very important peptide hormone called atrial natriuretic factor (ANF),which decreases blood pressure. When blood pressure is increased, ANFlis secreted which causes dilation of the blood vessels. This reduces theblood pressure.The juxtaglomerular cells of kidney produce a peptide hormone callederythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis (formation of RBC).Endocrine cells present in different parts of the gastro-intestinal tractsecrete four major peptide hormones, namely gastrin, secretin,cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). Gastrinacts on the gastric glands and stimulates the secretion of hydrochloricacid and pepsinogen. Secretin acts on the exocrine pancreas andstimulates secretion of water and bicarbonate ions. CCK acts on bothpancreas and gall bladder and stimulates the secretion of pancreaticenzymes and bile juice, respectively. GIP inhibits gastric secretion andmotility. Several other non-endocrine tissues secrete hormones calledgrowth factors. These factors are essential for the normal growth of tissuesand their repairing/regeneration.19.4MECHANISM OF HORMONE ACTIONHormones produce their effects on target tissues by binding to specificproteins called hormone receptors located in the target tissues only.Hormone receptors present on the cell membrane of the target cells arelcalled membrane-bound receptors and the receptors present inside thetarget cell are called intracellular receptors, mostly nuclear receptors(present in the nucleus). Binding of a hormone to its receptor leads to theformation of a hormone-receptor complex (Figure 19.5 a, b). Eachreceptor is specific to one hormone only and hence receptors are specific.lHormone-Receptor complex formation leads to certain biochemicalchanges in the target tissue. Target tissue metabolism and hence2024-25BIOLOGY248physiological functions are regulated by hormones. On the basis of theirchemical nature, hormones can be divided into groups :(i)peptide, polypeptide, protein hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon,pituitary hormones, hypothalamic hormones, etc.)(ii)steroids (e.g., cortisol, testosterone, estradiol and progesterone)(iii)iodothyronines (thyroid hormones)(iv)amino-acid derivatives (e.g., epinephrine).Hormones  which interact with membrane-bound receptors normallydo not enter the target cell, but generate second messengers (e.g., cycliclAMP, IP3, Ca++ etc) which in turn regulate cellular metabolism (Figure19.5a). Hormones which interact with intracellular receptors (e.g., steroidlhormones, iodothyronines, etc.) mostly regulate gene expression orchromosome function by the interaction of hormone-receptor complexwith the genome. Cumulative biochemical actions result in physiologicaland developmental effects (Figure 19.5b).(a)2024-25249249CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATIONSUMMARYThere are special chemicals which act as hormones and provide chemicalcoordination, integration and regulation in the human body. These hormonesregulate metabolism, growth and development of our organs, the endocrine glandsor certain cells. The endocrine system is composed of hypothalamus, pituitaryland pineal, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid, thymus and gonads (testisand ovary). In addition to these, some other organs, e.g., gastrointestinal tract,kidney, heart etc., also produce hormones. The pituitary gland is divided intolthree major parts, which are called as  pars distalis, pars intermedia and parsnervosa. Pars distalis produces six trophic hormones. Pars intermedia secretesFigure 19.5Diagramatic representation of the mechanism of hormone action :(a) Protein hormone  (b) Steroid hormone(b)2024-25BIOLOGY250only one hormone, while pars nervosa (neurohypophysis) secretes two hormones.The pituitary hormones regulate the growth and development of somatic tissuesland activities of peripheral endocrine glands. Pineal gland secretes melatonin, whichplays a very important role in the regulation of 24-hour (diurnal) rhythms of ourbody (e.g., rhythms of sleep and state of being awake, body temperature, etc.). Thelthyroid gland hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basalmetabolic rate, development and maturation of the central neural system,erythropoiesis, metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats, menstrual cycle.lAnother thyroid hormone, i.e., thyrocalcitonin regulates calcium levels in our bloodby decreasing it. The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) whichincreases the blood Ca2+ levels and plays a major role in calcium homeostasis. Thethymus gland secretes thymosins which play a major role in the differentiation ofT-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediated immunity. In addition, thymosinsalso increase the production of antibodies to provide humoral immunity. Theadrenal gland is composed of the centrally located adrenal medulla and the outeradrenal cortex. The adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine.These hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation, piloerection, sweating, heartlbeat, strength of heart contraction, rate of respiration, glycogenolysis, lipolysis,proteolysis. The adrenal cortex secretes glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, proteolysis, erythropoiesis,lcardio-vascular system, blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate and inhibitinflammatory reactions by suppressing the immune response. Mineralocorticoidsregulate water and electrolyte contents of the body. The endocrine pancreas secreteslglucagon and insulin. Glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesisresulting in hyperglycemia. Insulin stimulates cellular glucose uptake andutilisation, and glycogenesis resulting in hypoglycemia. Insulin deficiencyland/or insulin resistance result in a disease called diabetes mellitus.The testis secretes androgens, which stimulate the development, maturationand functions of the male accessory sex organs, appearance of the male secondarylsex characters, spermatogenesis, male sexual behaviour, anabolic pathways anderythropoiesis. The ovary secretes estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen stimulateslgrowth and development of female accessory sex organs and secondary sexlcharacters. Progesterone plays a major role in the maintenance of pregnancy aswell as in mammary gland development and lactation. The atrial wall of the heartproduces atrial natriuretic factor which decreases the blood pressure. Kidneylproduces erythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis. The gastrointestinal tractsecretes gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin and gastric inhibitory peptide. Thesehormones regulate the secretion of digestive juices and help in digestion.2024-25251251CHEMICAL COORDINATION AND INTEGRATIONEXERCISES1.Define the following:(a) Exocrine gland(b) Endocrine gland(c) Hormone2.Diagrammatically indicate the location of the various endocrine glands in ourbody.3.List the hormones secreted by the following:(a) Hypothalamus(b) Pituitary(c) Thyroid(d) Parathyroid(e) Adrenal(f) Pancreas(g) Testis(h) Ovary(i) Thymus(j) Atrium(k) Kidney(l) G-I Tract4.Fill in the blanks:Hormones  Target gland(a) Hypothalamic hormones__________________(b) Thyrotrophin (TSH)__________________(c) Corticotrophin (ACTH)__________________(d) Gonadotrophins (LH, FSH)__________________(e) Melanotrophin (MSH)__________________5.Write short notes on the functions of the following hormones:(a) Parathyroid hormone (PTH)(b) Thyroid hormones(c) Thymosins(d) Androgens(e) Estrogens(f) Insulin and Glucagon6.Give example(s) of:l(a) Hyperglycemic hormone and hypoglycemic hormone(b) Hypercalcemic hormonel(c) Gonadotrophic hormones(d) Progestational hormone(e) Blood pressure lowering hormonel(f) Androgens and estrogens7.Which hormonal deficiency is responsible for the following:(a) Diabetes mellitus(b) Goitre(c) Cretinism8.Briefly mention the mechanism of action of FSH.9.Match the following:Column IColumn II(a)T4(i)Hypothalamus(b)PTH(ii)Thyroid(c)GnRH(iii)Pituitary(d)LH(iv)Parathyroid2024-25NOTE",
