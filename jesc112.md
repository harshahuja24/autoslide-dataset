# Main Title: Magnetic Effects of Electric Current  

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Magnetism and Electric Current**  
Content:  
- Electric current flowing through a conductor generates a magnetic field around it.  
- This phenomenon, called electromagnetism, was discovered by Hans Christian Oersted.  
- The interaction between electricity and magnetism is the foundation of motors and generators.

### **Slide 2: Magnetic Field and Field Lines**  
Content:  
- A magnetic field is the region around a magnet where magnetic force is exerted.  
- Field lines emerge from the north pole and merge at the south pole, forming closed loops.  
- The density of field lines indicates the strength of the magnetic field.

### **Slide 3: Magnetic Field Due to Current-Carrying Conductors**  
Content:  
- A straight conductor carrying current produces concentric circular magnetic field lines.  
- The strength of the field depends on current magnitude and the distance from the conductor.  
- Right-hand thumb rule determines the direction of magnetic field lines around a conductor.

### **Slide 4: Magnetic Field Due to a Circular Loop and Solenoid**  
Content:  
- A circular loop carrying current generates a magnetic field similar to that of a bar magnet.  
- A solenoid is a coil of wire that produces a uniform magnetic field similar to a permanent magnet.  
- Solenoids are used to create electromagnets, which can be controlled by varying current.

### **Slide 5: Electromagnetic Induction**  
Content:  
- A changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a nearby conductor.  
- This principle, known as electromagnetic induction, was discovered by Michael Faraday.  
- It is used in generators to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.

### **Slide 6: Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule and Right-Hand Rule**  
Content:  
- Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule predicts the direction of force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field.  
- Fleming’s Right-Hand Rule determines the direction of induced current in a conductor moving in a magnetic field.  
- These rules are crucial for designing electric motors and generators.

### **Slide 7: Electric Motors and Their Working**  
Content:  
- An electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy using a rotating coil in a magnetic field.  
- The direction of motion is determined by Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule.  
- Motors are used in appliances like fans, washing machines, and industrial machinery.

### **Slide 8: Electric Generators and Their Applications**  
Content:  
- An electric generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy using electromagnetic induction.  
- Rotating a coil in a magnetic field induces alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC).  
- Generators are used in power plants to supply electricity for homes and industries.
