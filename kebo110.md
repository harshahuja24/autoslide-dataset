# Main Title: Cell Cycle and Cell Division  

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Cell Cycle**  
Content:  
- The cell cycle is the sequence of events by which a cell duplicates its genome and divides into two daughter cells  
- It consists of two main phases: interphase (preparation) and M phase (mitosis or cell division)  
- Cell growth, DNA replication, and division are tightly regulated to ensure proper cell function and genetic integrity  

---

### **Slide 2: Phases of the Cell Cycle**  
Content:  
- Interphase includes G1 (cell growth), S (DNA synthesis), and G2 (preparation for mitosis) phases  
- The M phase involves mitosis (nuclear division) and cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division)  
- Interphase occupies most of the cell cycle, while mitosis is a relatively short but critical phase  

---

### **Slide 3: Stages of Mitosis**  
Content:  
- Prophase: Chromosomes condense, and the nuclear envelope breaks down; spindle fibers form  
- Metaphase: Chromosomes align at the equatorial plate, attached to spindle fibers from opposite poles  
- Anaphase: Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell  

---

### **Slide 4: Completion of Mitosis**  
Content:  
- Telophase: Chromosomes decondense, and nuclear envelopes reform around the separated chromatids  
- Cytokinesis: The cytoplasm divides, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells  
- In plant cells, a cell plate forms, while animal cells form a cleavage furrow  

---

### **Slide 5: Significance of Mitosis**  
Content:  
- Mitosis ensures growth and repair by producing genetically identical diploid daughter cells  
- It maintains the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio and replaces damaged or dead cells in multicellular organisms  
- In plants, mitosis occurs in meristematic tissues, enabling continuous growth throughout their life

### **Slide 6: Introduction to Meiosis**  
Content:  
- Meiosis is a specialized cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, producing haploid gametes  
- It involves two sequential divisions: meiosis I (reductional) and meiosis II (equational)  
- Meiosis ensures genetic diversity through crossing over and independent assortment of chromosomes  

---

### **Slide 7: Stages of Meiosis I**  
Content:  
- Prophase I: Homologous chromosomes pair and undergo crossing over, exchanging genetic material  
- Metaphase I: Paired homologous chromosomes align at the equatorial plate  
- Anaphase I: Homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles, reducing the chromosome number  

---

### **Slide 8: Completion of Meiosis**  
Content:  
- Meiosis II resembles mitosis, separating sister chromatids to produce four haploid daughter cells  
- Telophase II: Nuclear envelopes reform, and cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm, forming gametes  
- Meiosis ensures genetic variation and conservation of chromosome number across generations in sexually reproducing organisms
