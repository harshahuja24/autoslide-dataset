# Main Title: Gravitation  

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Gravitation**  
Content:  
- Gravitation governs the attraction between masses, observed in falling objects and celestial motions like planetary orbits.  
- Galileo demonstrated all objects fall with constant acceleration; Newton later formulated the universal law of gravitation.  
- Kepler’s laws of planetary motion provided foundational insights into elliptical orbits and orbital dynamics.

### **Slide 2: Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion**  
Content:  
- **Law of Orbits**: Planets orbit the Sun in ellipses, with the Sun at one focus, replacing circular orbits.  
- **Law of Areas**: A planet sweeps equal areas in equal time intervals, implying variable orbital speed.  
- **Law of Periods**: The square of a planet’s orbital period is proportional to the cube of its orbital radius.

### **Slide 3: Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation**  
Content:  
- Gravitational force between two masses is proportional to their product and inversely proportional to the square of their separation.  
- Formula: \( F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \), where \( G \) is the universal gravitational constant.  
- The law applies to point masses and explains celestial motions, tides, and Earth’s gravitational pull.

### **Slide 4: Gravitational Constant (G)**  
Content:  
- Henry Cavendish first measured \( G \) using a torsion balance experiment with lead spheres in 1798.  
- Its value is \( 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2 \), critical for calculating planetary masses and gravitational forces.  
- \( G \)’s small magnitude explains why gravitational effects are noticeable only for large masses like planets.

### **Slide 5: Acceleration Due to Gravity**  
Content:  
- On Earth’s surface: \( g = \frac{GM_E}{R_E^2} \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), derived from Earth’s mass and radius.  
- At height \( h \): \( g(h) = g \left(1 - \frac{2h}{R_E}\right) \); decreases with altitude.  
- At depth \( d \): \( g(d) = g \left(1 - \frac{d}{R_E}\right) \); diminishes linearly below the surface.  

---  

### **Slide 6: Gravitational Potential Energy**  
Content:  
- Near Earth: \( U = mgh \), valid for small heights; assumes constant gravitational acceleration.  
- For large distances: \( U = -\frac{GMm}{r} \), with zero potential at infinity and negative values for bound systems.  
- Gravitational potential energy is conservative and follows the superposition principle for multi-body systems.  

---  

### **Slide 7: Escape Speed**  
Content:  
- Escape speed is the minimum velocity required to break free from a planet’s gravitational pull.  
- Formula: \( v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}} \); Earth’s escape speed is approximately \( 11.2 \, \text{km/s} \).  
- Depends on planetary mass and radius; lower for smaller bodies like the Moon (\( 2.3 \, \text{km/s} \)).  

---  

### **Slide 8: Earth Satellites and Orbital Energy**  
Content:  
- Satellites orbit Earth with speed \( v = \sqrt{\frac{GM_E}{R_E + h}} \), balancing gravitational and centripetal forces.  
- Total orbital energy \( E = -\frac{GMm}{2(R_E + h)} \), combining negative potential and positive kinetic energy.  
- Energy remains constant; elliptical orbits retain negative total energy, ensuring satellites remain bound.
