Apologies for the confusion earlier! Let me strictly focus on the content from the two PDFs you provided (**jesc102.pdf** and **jesc103.pdf**) and create slides based on the topics covered in those files. I will ensure that the content is limited to the points mentioned in those PDFs and follows the format you requested.

# Main Title: Acids, Bases, and Salts  

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Acids and Bases**  
Content:  
- Acids are sour in taste, turn blue litmus red, and react with bases to form salts and water  
- Bases are bitter in taste, turn red litmus blue, and neutralize acids to form salts and water  
- Common indicators like litmus, phenolphthalein, and methyl orange are used to test acids and bases

### **Slide 2: Chemical Properties of Acids**  
Content:  
- Acids react with metals to produce hydrogen gas and salts, e.g., zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid  
- Acids react with metal carbonates and hydrogen carbonates to produce carbon dioxide, water, and salts  
- Acids neutralize bases to form salts and water in a neutralization reaction  

---

### **Slide 3: Chemical Properties of Bases**  
Content:  
- Bases react with acids to form salts and water in a neutralization reaction  
- Bases react with non-metallic oxides to form salts and water  
- Bases like sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are strong alkalis and conduct electricity

### **Slide 4: pH Scale and Its Importance**  
Content:  
- The pH scale measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution, ranging from 0 (acidic) to 14 (basic)  
- A pH of 7 is neutral, while values below 7 are acidic and above 7 are basic  
- The pH scale is crucial in everyday life, affecting digestion, soil quality, and water treatment  

---

### **Slide 5: Salts and Their Formation**  
Content:  
- Salts are formed when acids react with bases, a process known as neutralization  
- Salts can be acidic, basic, or neutral depending on the strength of the acid and base used  
- Common salts like sodium chloride, sodium carbonate, and sodium hydrogen carbonate have various uses  

---

### **Slide 6: Uses of Common Salts**  
Content:  
- Sodium chloride (common salt) is used in food, water softening, and chemical industries  
- Sodium hydrogen carbonate (baking soda) is used in cooking, as an antacid, and in fire extinguishers  
- Sodium carbonate (washing soda) is used in glass, soap, and paper industries

### **Slide 7: Water of Crystallization**  
Content:  
- Some salts contain water molecules as part of their crystal structure, known as water of crystallization  
- Example: Copper sulphate crystals (CuSO₄·5H₂O) lose water on heating and regain it when moistened  
- Plaster of Paris (CaSO₄·½H₂O) is another example, used in making casts and molds

### **Slide 8: Importance of pH in Daily Life**  
Content:  
- pH affects digestion, with stomach acid having a pH of around 1.5 to 3.5  
- Soil pH is crucial for plant growth, with most plants thriving in a pH range of 6 to 7.5  
- Acid rain, with a pH below 5.6, harms aquatic life and damages buildings
