# Main Title: Light â€“ Reflection and Refraction

### **Slide 1: Introduction to Light**
Content:
- Light helps us see objects by reflecting off surfaces and entering our eyes.
- It travels in straight lines but can bend when passing through different media.
- Reflection and refraction explain common optical phenomena like mirrors, lenses, and rainbows.

---

### **Slide 2: Laws of Reflection**
Content:
- The angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection.
- The incident ray, reflected ray, and normal all lie in the same plane.
- Reflection follows these laws on both plane and curved surfaces.

### **Slide 3: Spherical Mirrors and Their Types**
Content:
- Concave mirrors have an inward-curved surface and focus light to a point.
- Convex mirrors have an outward-curved surface and spread light outwards.
- Both types are used in applications like vehicle mirrors, telescopes, and headlights.

### **Slide 4: Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors**
Content:
- Concave mirrors form real, inverted images for distant objects and virtual, erect images for nearby objects.
- Convex mirrors always produce smaller, virtual, and erect images.
- Ray diagrams help determine the image's position, size, and nature.

### **Slide 5: Refraction of Light**
Content:
- Refraction occurs when light changes speed and direction while passing between different media.
- A light ray bends towards the normal when entering a denser medium.
- A light ray bends away from the normal when entering a rarer medium.

---

### **Slide 6: Refractive Index and Optical Density**
Content:
- The refractive index measures how much light slows down in a medium compared to a vacuum.
- A higher refractive index means the medium is optically denser and slows light more.
- Materials like water, glass, and diamond have different refractive indices affecting light bending.

### **Slide 7: Lenses and Their Types**
Content:
- Convex lenses converge light and form real or virtual images based on object distance.
- Concave lenses diverge light and always produce virtual, smaller, and erect images.
- Lenses are used in eyeglasses, magnifiers, cameras, and microscopes.

### **Slide 8: Power of Lenses and Applications**
Content:
- The power of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length and is measured in diopters (D).
- Convex lenses have positive power, while concave lenses have negative power.
- Optical instruments use lens combinations to enhance magnification and clarity.
